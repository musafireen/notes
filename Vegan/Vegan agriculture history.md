There are several ancient and medieval Hindu and Sanskrit texts that discuss agricultural practices and the importance of vegetarianism. While they may not specifically focus on vegetarian farming as a distinct topic, these texts often provide guidance on sustainable and ethical agricultural practices that align with vegetarian principles. Here are a few examples:

1. "Krishi-Parashara": This text is attributed to the sage Parashara and is considered one of the earliest treatises on agriculture in ancient India. It discusses various aspects of farming, including the selection of land, cultivation techniques, crop rotation, and the use of organic fertilizers.

2. "Vrikshayurveda": Also known as "The Science of Plant Life," this ancient Sanskrit text covers a wide range of topics related to agriculture, horticulture, and plant medicine. It provides guidance on growing various crops, including fruits, vegetables, and grains, emphasizing the importance of sustainable and organic practices.

3. "Manusmriti" (Laws of Manu): While not exclusively an agricultural text, the Manusmriti is an ancient legal and ethical text that touches upon various aspects of life, including diet and ethical conduct. It promotes vegetarianism and encourages individuals to avoid harming animals, which indirectly supports a more sustainable and ethical approach to farming.

4. "Krishikosh": Written by the medieval poet Vallabhadeva, this text is a comprehensive treatise on agriculture. It covers a wide range of topics related to farming, including soil fertility, irrigation techniques, pest control, and crop management. While not exclusively focused on vegetarian farming, it provides valuable insights into sustainable agricultural practices.

These texts offer insights into ancient Indian agricultural practices and ethical considerations surrounding farming. While they may not specifically address vegetarian farming as a distinct concept, their principles can be applied to promote sustainable, ethical, and plant-based agricultural practices.
