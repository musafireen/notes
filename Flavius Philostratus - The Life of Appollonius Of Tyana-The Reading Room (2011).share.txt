───────────────

▪ votaries of Pythagoras of Samos have this story to tell of him (।)

▪ Empedocles of Acragas had trodden this way of wisdom when he wrote the line
“Rejoice ye, for I am unto you an immortal God, and no more mortal.”
And this also:
“For erewhile, I already became both girl and boy.”
And the story that he made at Olympia a bull of pastry and sacrificed it to the god also shows that he approved of the sentiments of Pythagoras (।)

▪ quite akin to theirs was the ideal which Apollonius pursued, and more divinely than Pythagoras he wooed wisdom and soared above tyrants; and he lived in times not long gone by (।)

▪ some, because he had interviews with the wizards of Babylon and with the Brahmans of India, and with the nude ascetics of Egypt, put him down as a wizard (apollonius of tyanna, not pythagoras | 
nude ascetic: gymnoi | 
wizard: magus)

▪ Empedocles and Pythagoras himself and Democritus consorted with wizards and uttered many supernatural truths, yet never stooped to the black art (black art: techne)

▪ Plato went to Egypt and mingled with his own discourses much of what he heard from the prophets and priests there; (in which dialogue?)

▪ we might as well accuse Socrates of the same, because, thanks to his familiar spirit, he knew things beforehand, (.)

▪ Anaxagoras at Olympia in a season when least rain falls [2] came forward wearing a fleece into the stadium, by way of predicting rain, and of how he foretold the fall of the house—and truly, for it did fall; and of how he said that day would be turned into night, and stones would be discharged from heaven round Aegospotami, and of how his predictions were fulfilled? (।)

▪ gathered my information partly from the many cities where he was loved, and partly from the temples whose long-neglected and decayed rites he restored, and partly from the accounts left of him by others and partly from his own letters. For he addressed these to kings, sophists, philosophers, to men of Elis, of Delphi, to Indians, and Ethiopians; (.)

▪ Damis, by no means stupid, who formerly dwelt in the ancient city of Nineveh. He resorted to Apollonius in order to study wisdom, and having shared, by his own account, his wanderings abroad, wrote an account of them.[3] (.)

▪ certain kinsmen of Damis drew the attention of the empress Julia [Domna, wife of Septimius Severus] to the documents (.)

▪ Philostratus feels clearly uncomfortable with the information that he found in “Damis”, which was incompatible with his own beliefs. We probably do best to assume that this text did indeed exist (.)

▪ she was a devoted admirer of all rhetorical exercises; and she commanded me to recast and edit these essays (.)

▪ To his mother, just before he was born, there came an apparition of Proteus, who changes his form so much in Homer,[4] in the guise of an Egyptian demon. She was in no way frightened, but asked him what sort of child she would bear. And he answered: “Myself.” (.)

▪ first of a series of allusions to the Odyssey in the Life of Apollonius, all placed on important turning points in the narrative (।)

▪ if Philostratus introduced Proteus as Apollonius’ divine father (।)

▪ “And who are you?” she asked.
“Proteus,” answered he, “the god of Egypt.” (.)

▪ swans who fed in the meadow set up a dance around her as she slept (।)

▪ She then leaped up at the sound of their song and bore her child (।)

▪ sudden fright is apt to bring on a premature delivery (।)

▪ people of the country say that just at the moment of the birth, a thunderbolt seemed about to fall to earth and then rose up into the air and disappeared aloft (।)

▪ near Tyana a well sacred to Zeus, the god of paths, so they say, and they call it the well of Asbama (।)

▪ spring rises cold, but bubbles up like a boiling cauldron (।)

▪ to perjurers it brings hot-footed justice; for it attacks their eyes and hands and feet, and they fall the prey of dropsy and wasting disease; and they are not even able to go away, but are held on the spot and bemoan themselves at the edge of the spring, acknowledging their perjuries. (।)

▪ people of the country, then, say that Apollonius was the son of this Zeus, but the sage called himself the son of Apollonius. (।)

▪ his tongue affected the Attic dialect, nor was his accent corrupted by the race he lived among (।)

▪ fourteenth year, his father brought him to Tarsus, to Euthydemus the teacher from Phoenicia.
Now Euthydemus was a good rhetor (।)

▪ atmosphere of the city harsh and strange and little conducive to the philosophic life, for nowhere are men more addicted than here to luxury; jesters and full of insolence (।)

▪ stream called the Cydnus runs through their city, along the banks of which they sit like so many water-fowl (।)

▪ transferred his teacher, with his father’s consent, to the town of Aegae, which was close by (।)

▪ temple of Asclepius, where that god reveals himself in person to men (।)

▪ There he had as his companions in philosophy followers of Plato and Chrysippus and peripatetic philosophers.[1] And he diligently attended also to the discourses of Epicurus, for he did not despise these either, although it was to those of Pythagoras that he applied himself with unspeakable wisdom and ardor (।)

▪ his teacher of the Pythagorean system was not a very serious person, nor one who practiced in his conduct the philosophy he taught; for he was the slave of his belly and appetites, and modeled himself upon Epicurus. And this man was Euxenus from the town of Heraclea in Pontus (।)

▪ he did not cease to love Euxenus, nay, he persuaded his father to present him with a villa outside the town, where there were tender groves and fountains, and he said to him: “Now you live there your own life, but I will live that of Pythagoras.”[2] (।)

▪ at what point he would begin it. Apollonius answered: “At the point at which physicians begin, for they, by purging the bowels of their patients prevent some from being ill at all, and heal others.” (।)

▪ declined to live upon a flesh diet, on the ground that it was unclean, and also that it made the mind gross; so he partook only of dried fruits and vegetables (।)

▪ he took to walking without shoes by way of adornment and clad himself in linen raiment, declining to wear any animal product; and he let his hair grow long and lived in the Temple (।)

▪ Asclepius one day said to the priest that he was delighted to have Apollonius as witness of his cures of the sick (।)

▪ People looking for a cure in a temple of Asclepius slept in the shrine, and dreamed about the cure that they needed. The task of the priest/phycisians was to find out what the dream meant. (muhammad in nas falaq)

▪ “I want the health which Asclepius promises, but never gives.”
“Hush,” said the other, “for he gives to those who desire it, but you do things that irritate and aggravate your disease, for you give yourself up to luxury, and you accumulate delicate viands upon your water-logged and worn-out stomach, and as it were, choke water with a flood of mud.” (।)

▪ This was a clearer response, in my opinion, than Heraclitus, in his wisdom, gave. For he said when he was visited by this affection that what he needed was someone to substitute a drought for a rainy weather, a very unintelligible remark (।)

▪ One day he saw a flood of blood upon the altar, and there were victims laid out upon it, Egyptian bulls that had been sacrificed and great hogs, and some of them were being flayed and others were being cut up; and two gold vases had been dedicated set with jewels, the rarest and most beautiful that India can provide (।)

▪ he declares that he will sacrifice more victims, and dedicate more gifts, if Asclepius will hearken to him. And he is one of the richest men in existence; at any rate he owns in Cilicia an estate bigger than all the Cilicians together possess (।)

▪ when he heard it, he said: “It seems to me, O Priest, that we ought not to welcome this fellow in the Temple: for he is some ruffian who has come here, and that he is afflicted in this way is due to some sinister reason: nay, his very conduct in sacrificing on such a magnificent scale before he has gained anything from the god is not that of a genuine votary, but rather of a man who is begging himself off for the penalty of some horrible and cruel deed.” (।)

▪ Cilicia was governed at the time by a ruffian addicted to infamous forms of passion. No sooner did he hear the beauty of Apollonius spoken of (।)

▪ “A prayer which can only be offered to the beautiful, and which is that they may grant to others participation in their beauty and not grudge their charms.”
This he said with a vile leer and voluptuous air and all the usual wriggles of such infamous debauchees (।)

▪ Apollonius with a stern fierce glance at him, said: “You are mad, you scum.” (।)

▪ three days later that the ruffian was executed by the officers of justice on the high road for having intrigued with Archelaus the king of Cappadocia against the Romans.[1] (।)

▪ he heard that his father was dead, he hurried to Tyana, and with his own hands buried him hard by his mother’s sepulcher, for she too had died not long before (।)

▪ he divided the property, which was very ample, with his brother, who was an incorrigibly bad character and given to drunk. (।)

▪ Someone said to him that it was his duty to correct his brother and convert him from his evil ways (।)

▪ he was the slave of play and of wine, and he serenaded courtesans and was vain of his hair, which he dressed up and dyed, strutting about like an arrogant dandy. (।)

▪ Anaxagoras of Clazomenae kept his philosophy for cattle rather than for men when he abandoned his fields to flocks and goats, and that Crates of Thebes, when he threw his money into the sea benefited neither man nor beast. (।)

▪ Sophocles, who only said that in reaching old age he had escaped from a mad and cruel master (।)

▪ there are those who accuse him falsely of an addiction to venery, alleging that he fell a victim of such sins and spent a whole year in their indulgence among the Scythians, the facts being that he never once visited Scythia (.)

▪ his quarrel with Apollonius was that the latter rallied him for doing anything for money and tried to wean him of his love of filthy lucre and of huckstering his wisdom (।)

▪ his company was not without charm during the period of his silence; for he would maintain a conversation by the expression of his eyes, by gestures of his hands and nodding his head (।)

▪ he practiced silence for five whole years (।)

▪ years of silence he spent partly in Pamphylia and partly in Cilicia; and though his paths lay through such effeminate races as these, he never spoke nor was even induced to murmur. (।)

▪ it is not so very difficult to restrain those who have started a quarrel about dances and horses (।)

▪ but a city hard pressed by famine is not so tractable, (।)

▪ Aspendus in Pamphylia (and this city is built on the river Eurymedon (।)

▪ excited crowd of all ages had set upon the governor, and were lighting a fire to burn him alive, (।)

▪ he was clinging to the statues of the Emperor (।)

▪ statues of Tiberius, in whose reign a master is said to have been held guilty of impiety, merely because he struck his own slave when he had on his person a silver drachma coined with the image of Tiberius. (।)

▪ “This man and that man,” and he named several, “are to blame for the famine which has arisen; for they have taken away the grain and are keeping it, one in one part of the country and another in another. (।)

▪ visited the great Antioch, and passed into the Temple of Apollo of Daphne, to which the Assyrians [1] attach the legend of Arcadia. For they say that Daphne, the daughter of Ladon, there underwent her metamorphosis, and they have a river flowing there, the Ladon, and a laurel tree is worshipped (।)

▪ Apollo had tried to rape the nymph Daphne, but she had changed into a laurel tree. In the original legend, this metamorphosis had taken place near the Ladon in Arcadia (।)

▪ a Temple so graceful and yet the home of no serious studies, but only of men half-barbarous and uncultivated, remarked: “O Apollo, change these dumb dogs [3] into trees, so that at least as cypresses they may become vocal.”
Note 3: A possible sneer at the Cynics. (।)

▪ At sunrise, indeed, he performed certain rites by himself, rites which he only communicated to those who had disciplined themselves by a four years’ spell of silence (surya namaskara)

▪ in case the city was a Greek one, and the sacred rituals familiar to a Greek, he would call the priests together and talk wisely about the gods, and would correct them, supposing they had departed from the traditional forms (।)

▪ If, however, the rites were barbarous and peculiar, then he would find out who had founded them and on what occasion they were established, and having learnt the sort of cult it was, he would make suggestions, in case he could think of any improvement upon them (।)

▪ he said that it was the duty of philosophers of his school to hold converse at the earliest dawn with the gods, but as the day advanced, about the gods, and during the rest of the day to discuss human affairs in friendly intercourse. (।)

▪ anointed and rubbed, and then fling himself into cold water, for he called hot baths the old age of men. (।)

▪ when the Ephesians wanted to stone their governor because he did warm their baths enough he said to them: “You are blaming your governor because you get such a sorry bath; but I blame you because you take a bath at all.” (।)

▪ literary style which he cultivated was not dithyrambic or tumid and swollen with poetical words (।)

▪ he thought that an excessive degree of Atticising was unpleasant (।)

▪ nor did anyone ever hear him dissembling to an ironical way (।)

▪ he would assume an oracular manner and use the expressions, “I know,” or “It is my opinion,” or, “Where are you drifting to?” or, “You must know.” (।)

▪ when a certain quibbler asked him, why he asked himself no questions, he replied: “Because I asked questions when I was a stripling (।)

▪ “How then,” the other asked him afresh, “O Apollonius, should the sage converse?”
“Like a law-giver,” he replied, (।)

▪ duty of the law-giver to deliver to the many [i.e., the populace] the instructions of whose truth he has persuaded himself.” (।)

▪ he formed the scheme of an extensive voyage, and had in mind the Indian race and the sages there, who are called Brahmans and Hyrcanians (.)

▪ made quite a windfall of the Magi, who live in Babylon and Susa (।)

▪ Babylonian sages were usually called Chaldaeans, but Philostratus calls them Magi, which is in fact the name of the sages of ancient Persia. The confusion is not unusual: the author of the gospel of Matthew also mentions Magi but ascribes to them the study of astral omens, a typical Chaldaean activity (.)

▪ Philostratus calls the Persian Magi “Hyrcanians”, after a region where the religion of Zarathustra prospered. (.)

▪ his followers, who were seven in number (।)

▪ he quitted Antioch with two attendants, who belonged to his father’s house, one of them a shorthand writer and the other a calligraphist. (।)

▪ city of Nineveh,[5] where he found an idol set up of barbarous aspect, and it is, they say, Io, the daughter of Inachus, and horns short and, as it were, budding project from her temples.[6] (।)

▪ forming wiser conclusions about the image than could the priests and prophets (।)

▪ one Damis, a native of Nineveh, joined him as a pupil (।)

▪ Nineveh, called “Ninos” in Greek, was the capital of ancient Assyria, destroyed by the Medes and Babylonians in 612 (।)

▪ Bambyce, close to Zeugma, was also once known as Ninos (manbij)

▪ There is need to duplicate Ninos, however, because the city was refounded in the Parthian age (।)

▪ That Philostratus really thought about the capital of Assyria, can also be deduced from Philostratus’ remark that it was close to Media (7.14) and that Damis speak the language of the Cadusians. (.)

▪ Perhaps Tiamat, the cow-like monster from the Mesopotamian creation epic. (।)

▪ Armenian tongue, and that of the Medes [7] and Persians, and that of the Kadusii, and I am familiar with all of them.” (।)

▪ I,” said Apollonius, “my good friend, understand all languages, though I never learnt a single one.” (।)

▪ Damis replied thus: “If banquets there be of gods, and gods take food, surely they must have attendants whose business it is that not even the parcels of ambrosia that fall to the ground should be lost.”[8]
Note 8: Cf. Mark 7.27-28. (।)

▪ Mesopotamia is bordered on one side by the Tigris, and on the other by the Euphrates (।)

▪ Armenian and the Arab. These races are so shut in by the rivers that most of them, who lead the life of nomads, are so convinced that they are islanders, as to say that they are going down to the sea, when they are merely on their way to the rivers, and think that these rivers border the earth and encircle it (।)

▪ Since Eratosthenes of Cyrene, the Taurus was regarded as the mountain range that divided Asia into two halfs. The mountains of Armenia, the Elburz, the Hindu Kush, and the Himalayas were all considered to be part of the Taurus. (.)

▪ after the matter of the Arabs he managed to understand the language of the animals. (।)

▪ common for the Arabs to listen to the birds prophesying like any oracles, but they acquire this faculty of understanding them by feeding themselves, so they say, either on the heart or liver of serpents. (serpents, talking about jinn? damis unreliable translator)

▪ left Ctesiphon behind, and passed on to the borders of Babylon;[1] and here was a frontier garrison belonging to the king, which one could not pass by without being questioned (।)

▪ “I will give you,” said the other, “leavened bread and palm dates, like amber and of good size. And I will also supply you with vegetables, the best which the gardens of the Tigris afford.” (।)

▪ said Apollonius, “the wild herbs which grow free are nicer than those which are forced and artificial.” (।)

▪ our land in the direction of Babylon is full of wormwood [5] so that the herbs which grow in it are disagreeably bitter.”
Note 5: Absinth. (।)

▪ lioness that had been slain in a chase (।)

▪ must not believe those who say that the whelps of a lioness make their way out into the world by clawing through their mother’s womb;[6] for nature seems to have created the relationship of offspring to mother for their nourishment with a view to the continuance of the race.
Note 6: E.g., Herodotus of Halicarnassus. (not in all cases, crabs)

▪ length of our stay with the king will be a year and eight months (।)

▪ guess the number of months from that of the whelps, and that of the years from the lioness (।)

▪ Damis replied: “But what of the sparrows of Homer, what do they mean, the ones which the dragon devoured in Aulis, which were eight in number, when he seized their mother for a ninth? [Iliad 2.303ff] Calchas surely explained these to signify nine years and predicted that the war with Troy would last so long (।)

▪ Homer was surely quite right in comparing the nestlings to years, for they are already hatched out and in the world; but what I had in mind were incomplete animals that were not yet born (।)

▪ as he advanced into the Cissian country [7] and was already close to Babylon, he was visited by a dream, and the god who revealed it to him fashioned its imagery as follows: there were fishes which had been cast up from the sea on to the land, and they were gasping, and uttering a lament almost human, and bewailing that they had quitted their element; and they were begging a dolphin [8] that was swimming past the shore to help them in their misery, just like human beings who are weeping in a foreign land. (musa and slave and fish in Qur'an)

▪ Cissia is habited by the Eretrians, who were brought up here from Euboea by Darius five hundred years ago, and they are said to have been treated at their capture like the fishes that we saw in the dream (।)

▪ It would seem then that the gods are instructing me to visit them and tend their needs (।)

▪ this well is said to consist of a mixture of pitch and oil and water, and if you draw up a bucket and pour it out, these three elements divide and part themselves from one another. (।)

▪ That he really did visit Cissia, he himself acknowledges in a letter which he wrote to the sophist of Clazomenae [Scopelianus] (।)

▪ he urges the sophist to take pity on the Eretrians (।)

▪ whole of Cissia consists of villages, except for a race of nomads that also inhabits it [Cossaeans], men who seldom dismount from their horses. And the settlement of the Eretrians is in the center of the rest, and the river is carried round it in a trench, for they say that they themselves diverted it round the village in order to form a rampart of defense against the barbarians of the country. (।)

▪ soil is drenched with pitch, and is bitter to plant in; and the inhabitants are very short lived, because the pitch in the water forms a sediment in most of their bowels (।)

▪ they get their sustenance off a bit of rising ground on the confines of their village (।)

▪ they managed to open a quarry on the hill; and as some of them understood the art of cutting stone, they built temples in the Greek style and a market-place large enough for their purpose; and they dedicated various altars, two to Darius, and one to Xerxes, and several to Daridaeus. But up to the time of Daridaeus, 88 years after their capture, they continued to write in the manner of the Greeks (।)

▪ epigram was in fact written by Plato (।)

▪ sage’s stay in Babylon (।)

▪ texts from Babylon itself, however, indicate the continuity of its cultural life; the Esagila was still there, the Chaldaeanswere still doing their work, and the Gymnasium Inscription and Theater Inscription show that the Greek community still existed (।)

▪ woman, Medea, was formerly queen of those parts (।)

▪ subjects embroidered on the stuffs are taken by them from Hellenic story, Andromedas being represented, and Amymonae, and you see Perseus frequently. And they delight in Orpheus, perhaps out of regard for his peaked cap and breeches, for it cannot be for his music or the songs with which he charmed and soothed others. (।)

▪ occupation of Athens and Thermopylae, and other pictures still more to the Median taste (।)

▪ man’s apartment of which the roof had been carried up in the form of a dome, to resemble in a manner the heavens, and that it was roofed with lapis lazuli, a stone that is very blue and like heaven to the eye; and there were images of the gods, which they worship, fixed aloft, and looking like golden figures shining out of the ether. And it is here that the king gives judgment, and golden wrynecks are hung from the ceiling, to remind him of Adrastea, the goddess of justice, and to engage him not to exalt himself above humanity. These figures the Magi themselves say they arranged; for they have access to the palace, and they call them the tongues of the gods. [12] (।)

▪ Damis is not acquainted with the conversations which the sage held with the Magi, for the latter forbade him to accompany him in his visits to them; so he tells us merely that he visited the Magi at mid-day and about midnight (।)

▪ When then he arrived at Babylon, the satrap [2] in command the great gates, having learnt that he had come to see the country, held out a golden image of the king, which everyone must kiss before he is allowed to enter the city (।)

▪ ambassador coming from the Roman Emperor has not this ceremony imposed upon him, but anyone who comes from the barbarians or just to look at the country, is arrested with dishonor unless he has first paid his respect to this image (।)

▪ dream which the king had dreamed was as follows: he thought that he was Artaxerxes, the son of Xerxes (।)

▪ he remembered about Themistocles of Athens, who had once come from Greece and had lived with Artaxerxes (।)

▪ Pamphylian woman who is said to have been intimate with Sappho, and to have composed the hymns which they sing in honor of Artemis of Perga, in the Aeolian and Pamphylian modes.” (।)

▪ Aeolian strains were altered into the highest key of all, that which is peculiar to the Pamphylians (।)

▪ Damophyle, and she is said, like Sappho, to have had girlfriends and to have composed poems, some of which were love-songs and others hymns. The particular hymn to Artemis was transposed by her, and the singing of it derives from Sapphic odes.” (।)

▪ conflict that followed on the death of Darius II; his two sons fought a bloody civil war. The conflict parallels the war between Vardanes and Gotarzes, but Philostratus’ contemporaries will have seen parallels with the conflicts between the emperors Caracalla and Geta (in 211) and between Heliogabalus and Severus Alexander (in 222) as well. There’s also a parallel to the presumed conflict between Vespasian’s sons Titus and Domitian: according to Philostratus, Titus was poisoned by his brother. (।)

▪ This is Apollonius, whom Megabates, my brother, said he saw in Antioch (।)

▪ king addressed him in the Greek language and invited him to sacrifice with him (।)

▪ he was on the point of sacrificing to the Sun as a victim a horse of the true Nisaean breed, which he had adorned with trappings as if for a triumphal procession (parthian mithra ashvamedha)

▪ he threw the frankincense into the fire, and watched to see how the smoke of it curled upwards, and how it grew turbid, and in how many points it shot up; and in a manner he caught the meaning of the fire, and watched how it appeared of good omen and pure (।)

▪ my own system of wisdom is that of Pythagoras, a man of Samos, who taught me to worship the gods in the way you see (।)

▪ the very fashion of letting my hair grow long, I have learnt from Pythagoras (।)

▪ if I am housed above my rank, I shall be ill at ease, for superfluity distresses wise men more than deficiency distresses you. Let me therefore be entertained by some private person who has the same means as myself, and I will visit with you as often as you like.” (।)

▪ eunuchs presented himself and addressed him thus: “The king,” he said, “bestows upon you ten presents, and leaves you free to name them (।)

▪ “Damis,” said Apollonius, “I am thinking over with myself the question of why the barbarians have regarded eunuchs as men sufficiently chaste to be allowed the free entry of the women’s apartments.” (।)

▪ To-morrow, Damis, you shall learn that even eunuchs are liable to fall in love, and that the desire which is contracted through the eyes is not extinguished in them, but abides alive and ready to burst into a flame (।)

▪ For chastity consists in not yielding to passion when the longing and impulse is felt, and in the abstinence which rises superior to this form of madness (then chastity is virtue inferior to the morality of annihilation)

▪ a wise man runs more risk than do sailors and soldiers in action, for envy is ever assailing him, whether he holds his tongue or speaks, whether he exerts himself or is idle, whether he passes by anything or takes care to visit anyone, whether he addresses others or neglects to address them (।)

▪ I will not, O king, decline all your gifts; but there is one which I prefer to may tens of gifts, and for that I will most eagerly solicit.”
And he at one told the story of the Eretrians, beginning it from the time of Datis. “I ask then,” he said, “that these poor people should not be driven away from their borders and from the hill, but should be left to cultivate the span of earth, which Darius allowed them (।)

▪ “I need dried fruits and bread, for that is a repast which delights me and which I find magnificent.” (।)

▪ Parthian king in Babylon is a bit strange; his palace was in Ctesiphon (।)

▪ guards of the harem [1] were now dragging him along by the hair in the way they do royal slaves (।)

▪ senior of the eunuchs accordingly declared that he had long before noticed he had an affection for this particular lady, and had already forbidden him to talk to her or touch her neck or hand, or assist her toilette, though he was free to wait upon all the other members of the harem; yet he had now caught him behaving as if he were the lady’s lover (perhaps they still want to be loved platonically)

▪ if he lives with this disease of impotence on him, and can never take pleasure in eating or drinking, nor in the spectacles which delight you and your companions, and if his heart will throb as he often leaps up in his sleep, as they say is particularly the case of people in love,—is there any form of consumption so wasting as this (how hateful)

▪ king was going to hunt the animals in the parks in which the barbarians keep lions and bears and leopards (।)

▪ it is no pleasure to me to attack animals that have been ill-treated and enslaved in violation of their nature.” (।)

▪ most stable and secure way of governing, Apollonius answered: “To respect many, and confide in few.” (।)

▪ king was showing to him the grotto under the Euphrates (।)

▪ It would be a real miracle, O king, if you went dry-shod through a river as deep as this and as unfordable (।)

▪ when he was shown the walls of Ecbatana, and was told that they were the dwelling-place of gods, he remarked: “They are not the dwelling place of gods at all, and I am not sure that they are of real men either; for, O king, the inhabitants of the city of Lacedaemon do not dwell within walls, and have never fortified their city.” (।)

▪ “How, then,” said the other, “and in what manner can I best make use of it?”
“By spending it,” he said, “for you are king.” (।)

▪ people who visited the lotus-eaters in their ships [3] were seduced from their own home-principles by the food; but we, without tasting any of the victuals of this land, have remained here a longer time than is right and fitting.” (।)

▪ do you anyhow take a guide,” said the king, “and camels on which to ride; for the road is too long (।)

▪ we must lay in a supply of water also, and take it in bottles, like wine (।)

▪ three days the country is waterless,[4] but after that there are plenty of rivers and springs (।)

▪ road over the Caucasus, for there you will find plenty of the necessities of life (।)

▪ Although polygamy was known in the ancient Near East, there is no parallel for the Ottoman practice to make the royal concubines live in seclusion. Conybeare’s translation “harem” is anachronistic. (।)

▪ salty desert between modern Qom and Tehran (ancient Rhagae) (।)

▪ Caucasus they say that they found the land becoming more fragrant.
[§2] We may regard this mountain as the beginning of the Taurus, which extends through Armenia and Cilicia as far as Pamphylia and Mycale, and it ends at the sea on the shore of which the Carians live, and we may regard this as the extreme end of the Caucasus (.)

▪ peaks of the Caucasus are so lofty that the sun is cloven asunder by them. And it encompasses with the rest of the Taurus the whole of Scythia which borders on India, and skirts Maeotis and the left side of the Pontus (.)

▪ part of the Taurus as is in our country, to the effect that it projects beyond Armenia, -it was long disbelieved, but has received definite confirmation from the conduct of the [leo]pards, which I know are caught in the spice-bearing region of Pamphylia (numayr harran)

▪ pard was once caught in Pamphylia which was wearing a chain round its neck, and the chain was of gold, and on it was inscribed in Armenian lettering:
“The king Arsaces to the Nysian god.”
Now the king of Armenia was certainly at that time Arsaces, and he, I imagine, finding the pard, had let it go free in honor of Dionysus because of its size. For Dionysus is called Nysian by the Indians and by all the Oriental races from Nysa in India.[2] (।)

▪ Caucasus bounds India and Media, and stretches down by another arm [the Zagros] to the Red Sea (red sea is indian ocean)

▪ legends are told of this mountain by the barbarians, which also have an echo in the poems of the Greeks about it, to the effect that Prometheus, because of his love of man, was bound there, and that Heracles — another Heracles, for of course the Theban is not meant—could not brook the ill-treatment of Prometheus, and shot the bird which was feeding upon his entrails (prometheus is fridun? /zahhak harut marut? । 
heracles is rustam | 
bird is ? | 
dajjal bound in chains but in some mediterranean island | not in caucasus)

▪ some say that he was bound in a cave, which as a matter of fact is shown in a foot-hill of the mountain;[3] and Damis says that his chains still hung from the rocks (।)

▪ others say that they bound him on the peak of the mountain; and it has two summits, and they say that his hands were lashed to them, although they are distant from one another not less than as stade, so great was his bulk. (।)

▪ inhabitants of the Caucasus regard the eagle as a hostile bird, and burn out the nests which they build among the rocks by hurling into them fiery darts, and they also set snares for them, declaring that they are avenging Prometheus (।)

▪ Having passed the Caucasus our travelers say they saw men four cubits height, and they were already black, and that when they passed over the river Indus they saw others five cubits high (।)

▪ on their way to this river our wayfarers found the following incidents worth of notice. For they were traveling by bright moonlight, when the figure of an empusa or hobgoblin appeared to them, that changed from one form into another, and sometimes vanished into nothing (φάσμα)

▪ Apollonius realized what it was, and himself heaped abuse on the hobgoblin and instructed his party to do the same, saying that this was the right remedy for such a visitation. And the phantasm fled away shrieking even as ghosts do (।)

▪ ascending through an untrodden and divine region: for you heard our guide say that the barbarians declare this tract to be the home of the gods (himavat himalaya?)

▪ I had heard, O Apollonius, that Anaxagoras of Clazomenae observed the heavenly bodies from the mountain Mimas in Ionia, and Thales of Miletus from Mycale which was close by his home; and some are said to have used as their observation mount Pangaeus and others Athos (।)

▪ I have come up a greater height than any of these, and yet shall go down again no wiser than I was before (।)

▪ such lookouts show you indeed a bluer heaven and bigger stars and the sun rising out of the night; but all these phenomena were manifest long ago to shepherds and goatherds (।)

▪ neither Athos will reveal to those who climb up it, nor Olympus, so much extolled by the poets, in what way God cares for the human race and how he delights to be worshipped by them, nor reveal the nature of virtue and of justice and temperance (।)

▪ theory about the Taurus as a continuing mountain range from Mycale to the far east, where it is called “Caucasus” (i.e., Zagros, Elburz, Hindu Kush, Himalaya), was proposed by Eratosthenes of Cyrene (।)

▪ Since Alexander the Great had visited India, it was believed that Nysa, where Dionysus was born, was in the far east (dionysus raised in nysa by hyades rohini (not pleiades krttika mātrkas who raised skanda))

▪ Arsacid king (i.e., the ruler of the Parthian Empire); one of his most important towns was Nisaia. (nisaia nysa dionysus)

▪ beyond the mountain, they at once came upon elephants with men riding on them; and these people dwell between the Caucasus and the river Cophen, and they are rude in their lives and they are nomad riders on the herds of elephants (।)

▪ some of them however rode on camels, which are used by Indians for carrying dispatches (।)

▪ One of the Indians, then, who was riding on such a camel (।)

▪ offered them wine which they had made out of palm dates and honey from the same tree, and steaks from the flesh of lions and leopards which they had just flayed (toddy)

▪ you will not, I am sure, refuse this as you do wine that is made from the fruit of the vine.” (।)

▪ Dionysus might will pardon one who refuses all wine whatever, but if I chose date wine in preference to that made of grapes, he would be aggrieved, I am sure, and say that this gift had been scorned and flouted (।)

▪ guide saying that the mountain of Nysa is close by, upon which Dionysus works, I believe, a great many miracles (siva parvata)

▪ we have seen a great many Indians overcome by this wine, some of them dancing till they fell, and others singing drowsily, just like the people among us, who end drinking bouts at night and don’t go home till dawn (।)

▪ that you yourself regard this drink as genuine wine, is clear from the fact that you poured out a libation of it to Zeus and offered up the prayers which usually accompany wine. (।)

▪ abstinence from these things has, I perceive, profited you nothing (abstinence not for ahimsa)

▪ crossed the river Cophen, themselves in boats, but the camels by a ford on foot; for the river has not yet reached its full size here. They were now in a continent subject to the king, in which the mountain of Nysa rises, covered to its very top with plantations, like the mounntain of Tmolus in Lydia, and you can ascend it, because paths been made by cultivators (।)

▪ when they ascended it, they found the shrine of Dionysus (।)

▪ which it is said Dionysus founded in honor of himself, planting round it a circle of laurel trees which encloses just as much ground as suffices to contain a moderate sized temple. He also surrounded the laurels with a border of ivy and vines; and he set up inside an image of himself, knowing that in time the trees would grow together and make themselves into a kind of roof (svayambhu)

▪ there were sickles and wine-presses and their dedicated to Dionysus, as if to one who gathers grapes, all made of gold and silver (।)

▪ image resembled a youthful Indian, and was carved out of polished white stone (।)

▪ Dionysus celebrates his orgies and shakes Nysa, the cities underneath the mountain hear the noise and exult in sympathy (tandava)

▪ Hellenes disagree with the Indians, and the Indians among themselves, concerning this Dionysus (।)

▪ we declare that the Theban Dionysus made an expedition to India in the role both of soldier and of reveler, and we base our arguments, among other things, on the offering at Delphi, which is secreted in the treasuries there. And it is a disk of silver bearing the inscription:
“Dionysus the son of Semele and of Zeus, from the men of India to the Apollo of Delphi.” (।)

▪ Indians who dwell in the Caucasus and along the river Cophen say that he was an Assyrian visitor when he came to them, who knew the religious rites of the Theban (asura?)

▪ those who inhabit the district between the Indus and the Hydraotes and the continental region beyond, which ends at the river Ganges, declare that Dionysus was son of the river Indus, and that the Dionysus of Thebes having become his disciple adopted the thyrsus and devoted himself to the orgies; that this Dionysus on saying that he was the son of Zeus and had lived safe inside his father’s thigh until he was born, gained from this Dionysus a mountain called Merus or “Thigh” on which Nysa borders, and planted Nysa in honor of Dionysus with the vine of which he had brought the suckers from Thebes; and that it was there that Alexander held his orgies. (।)

▪ inhabitants of Nysa deny that Alexander ever went up the mountain, although he was eager to do so (।)

▪ afraid lest his Macedonians, if they got among vines, which they had not seen for a long time, would fall into a fit of home-sickness or recover their taste for wine (।)

▪ they say he passed by Nysa, making his vow to Dionysus, and sacrificing at the foot of the mountain. (।)

▪ it was a greater thing that he never went up, in order to maintain the sobriety of his army, than that he should have ascended the mountain and have himself held a revel there, which is what they tell you. (।)

▪ Damis says that he did not see the rock called the “Birdless” (Aornus), which is not far distant from Nysa, because this lay off their road, and their guide feared to diverge from the direct path.[2] (।)

▪ he says he heard that it had been captured by Alexander (।)

▪ on the summit of the rock there is, they say, a cleft which draws into itself the birds which fly over it, as we may see at Athens also in the vestibule of the Parthenon, and in several places in Phrygia and Lydia. And this is why the rock was called and actually is “Birdless”.[3] (।)

▪ Uttarâpatha, “the upper road”, the ancestor of the modern Grand Trunk Road (।)

▪ cross the river north of modern Attock, at a place once called Wahind (“Gate to India”) and now known as Hund (।)

▪ Aornus, now called Pir Sar, is further to the north (।)

▪ Aornus in fact is derived from Old Indian Âvárana, “hiding place” (।)

▪ as they made their way to the Indus they met a boy of about thirteen years old mounted on an elephant and striking the animal (।)

▪ seems to me a superhuman feat for such a tiny mite to manage so huge an animal and guide it with the crook (।)

▪ Some of them are marsh elephants, others again mountain elephants, and there is third kind which belong to the plain: and they are captured for use in war (।)

▪ came on an elephant near Taxila (।)

▪ greatest city in India (।)

▪ gold rings around its tusks or horns, whichever you call them, and an inscription was on them written in Greek, as follows:
“Alexander the son of Zeus dedicates Ajax to the Sun.”
For he had given this name to the elephant, (।)

▪ Juba, who was once sovereign of the Libyan race, says that formerly the knights of Libya fought with one another on elephants, and division of these had a tower engraved upon their tusks, but the others nothing. And when night interrupted the fray the animals which were so marked had, he says, got the worst of it, and fled into Mount Atlas; but he himself 400 years afterwards caught one of the fugitives (।)

▪ elephants of the plain are said to be good and tractable, and fond of learning tricks; for they will write and dance, and will sway themselves to and fro and leap up and down from the ground to the sound of the pipe. (।)

▪ silly speculation indulged in by those who idly dispute whether the affection that men feel for their young is natural or not, when these very elephants, by their conduct, proclaim that it is so (।)

▪ bears, for they are the fiercest of all animals, and yet they will do anything for their whelps (।)

▪ lioness, how she will make a lover of the panther and receive him in the lion’s lair in the plain; but when she is going to bring forth her young she flees into the mountains to the haunts of the panthers; for she brings forth young ones that are spotted, and that is why she hides her young and nurses them in winding thickets, pretending that she is spending the day out hunting (।)

▪ if the lion detected the trick, he would tear the whelps in pieces and claw her offspring as illegitimate (।)

▪ tigress, although she is the cruelest animal, will in this country and also on the Read Sea approach the ships, to demand back her whelps; and if she gets them back, she goes off mightily delighted; but if the ships sail away, they say that she howls along the sea-coast and sometimes dies outright. (।)

▪ seal that was kept shut up at Aegae in the circus, and she mourned so deeply for her whelp, which had died after being born in confinement, that she refused food for three days together, although she is the most voracious of animals (।)

▪ we did say so, Damis; for if intelligence did not govern this animal, neither would it subsist, nor the populations among which it lived. (evolution)

▪ they appear to be running away from men who are pursuing them, and whom we shall doubtless come across, as they follow the animals’ tracks; and they must and ought to use their best strength to fortify their rear against attack, as is done in war (।)

▪ elephants assist one another when they are being hunted, and that they will defend one that is exhausted, and if they can remove him out of danger, they anoint his wounds with the tears of the aloe tree, standing round him like physicians.” (।)

▪ statements by Nearchus and Pythagoras, about the river Acesines, to the effect that it debauches into the Indus, and that snakes breed in it seventy cubits long, were, they say, fully verified by them (।)

▪ Vardanes. For he had addressed the letter in question to the satrap [1] of the Indus, although he was not subject to his dominion; and in it he reminded him of the good service he had done him, but declared that he would not ask any recompense for the same (।)

▪ he lent his official boat for him to embark in and other vessels on which the camels were ferried across, and he also sent a guide to the whole of the country which is bordered by the Hydraotes, and he wrote to his own king, begging him not to treat with less respect than Vardanes a man who was a Greek and divine. (।)

▪ Indus arises in the Caucasus and is bigger at its source than any of the other rivers of Asia (।)

▪ snow on the hills in Ethiopia and in the land of the Catadupi, and I do not choose to contradict, out of respect for the authorities; nevertheless, I cannot agree with them, when I consider how the Indus effects the same results as the Nile, without any snow falling on the country that rises behind and above it (indus does have snow where it rises it is glacier)

▪ God has set the Ethiopian and the Indian at the two extremes or horns of the entire earth, making black the latter who dwell where the sun rises no less than the former who dwell where it sets; now how should this be the case of the inhabitants, unless they enjoyed summer heat even in the winter? But where the sun warms the earth all over through the year, how can one suppose that it ever snows? (।)

▪ being conveyed across the Indus, they say that they came across many river-horses [hippopotamuses] and many crocodiles [gavials] (।)

▪ they say that the vegetation on the Indus resembles that which grows along the Nile (।)

▪ climate of India is sunny in winter, but suffocating in summer; but to conteract this Providence has excellently contrived that it should often rain in their country [the monsoon]. (।)

▪ king was in the habit of coming to this river when it rose in the appropriate seasons, and would sacrifice to the river black bulls and horses (।)

▪ white is less esteemed by the Indians than black, because, I imagine, the latter is their own color (।)

▪ plunges into the river a measure of gold made to resemble that which is used in measuring wheat (।)

▪ they themselves conjectured that this measure was sunk in the river, either to secure the plentiful harvest, whose yield the farmers use such a measure to gauge, or to keep the river within its proper bounds and prevent it from rising to such heights as that it would drown the land (।)

▪ after they had crossed the river, they were conducted by the satrap’s guide direct to Taxila, where the Indian had his royal palace (।)

▪ on that side of the Indus the dress of the people consists of native linen, with shoes of byblus and a hat when it rains; but that the upper classes there are appareled in byssus; and that the byssus grows upon a tree of which the stem resembles that of the white poplar, and the leaves those of the willow (।)

▪ byssus is imported into Egypt from India for many sacred uses (।)

▪ Taxila, they tell us, is about as big as Nineveh,[2] and was fortified fairly well after the manner of Greek cities; and here was the royal residence of the personage who then ruled the empire of Porus. (।)

▪ Temple, they saw, in front of the wall, which was not far short of 100 feet in size, made of porphyry,[3] and there was constructed within it a shrine, somewhat small as compared with the great size of the Temple which is surrounded with columns (।)

▪ bronze tablets were nailed into each of its walls on which were engraved the exploits of Porus and Alexander. But the pattern was wrought with orichalcus and silver and gold and black bronze, of elephants, horses, soldiers, helmets, shields, but spears, and javelins and swords, were all made of iron (।)

▪ composition was like the subject of some famous painting by Zeuxis or Polygnotus and Euphranor, who delighted in light and shade (।)

▪ Porus dedicated these designs after the death of the Macedonian, who is depicted in the hour of victory, restoring Porus who is wounded, and presenting him with India which was now his gift. (।)

▪ as long as Alexander was alive after his departure from India, he never used the royal diction and style, although he had license to do so, nor issued kingly edicts to the Indians, but figured himself as satrap full of moderation, and guided every action by the wish to please Alexander. (।)

▪ the temple is at Jandial (।)

▪ translation error: lithou kogchyliatou does not mean “of porphyry” but “of stone covered with stucco” (।)

▪ they say that he was the handsomest of his race, and in stature taller than any man since the Trojan heroes (।)

▪ if we drew one of these Indians with a pencil without color, yet he would be known for a negro, for his flat nose, and his stiff curling locks and prominent jaw, and a certain gleam about his eyes, would give a black look to the picture and depict an Indian to the eyes of all those who have intelligence. (।)

▪ houses were built in such a way that if you look at them from outside they had only one story, while if you went into one of them, you at once found subterranean chambers extending as far below the level of the earth as did the chambers above (।)

▪ Temple of the Sun in which was kept loose a sacred elephant called Ajax, and there were images of Alexander made of gold, and others of Porus, though the latter were of black bronze. But on the walls of the Temple there were red stones, and gold glittered underneath, and gave off a sheen as bright as sunlight. But the statue was compacted of pearls arranged in the symbolic manner affected by all barbarians in their shrines (।)

▪ in the palace they say that they saw no magnificent chambers, nor any bodyguards or sentinels, but, considering what is usual in the houses of magnates, a few servants, and three or four people (।)

▪ they admired this arrangement more than they did the pompous splendor of Babylon (।)

▪ barbarians who live on the border of this country were perpetually quarreling with us and making raids into my territories, but I keep them quiet and control them with money, so that my country is patrolled by them (।)

▪ Apollonius, who was so captivated by him, that once, when he was rebuking Euphrates for his want of philosophic self-respect, he remarked: “Nay, let us at least reverence Phraotes the Indian,” for this was the name of the Indian (।)

▪ Apollonius also asked him about his diet, and he replied: “I drink just as much wine as I pour out in libation to the Sun; and whatever I take in the chase I give to others to eat, for I am satisfied with the exercise I get. But my own meal consists of vegetables and of the pith and fruit of date palms, and of all that a well-watered garden yields in the way of fruit. And a great deal of fruit is yielded to me by the trees which I cultivate with these hands.” (।)

▪ king ordered the guide from Babylon to be well entertained, as it was customary so to treat those who came from Babylon (।)

▪ when they had taken their bath, they proceeded into the banqueting chamber with wreaths upon their heads; for this is the custom of the Indians, whenever they drink wine in the palace. (।)

▪ king then banquets upon a mattress, and as many as five of his nearest relations with him (।)

▪ rest join in the feast sitting upon chairs (।)

▪ table resembles an altar in that it is built up to the height of a man’s knee in the middle of the chamber, and allows rooms for thirty to dispose themselves around it like a choir in a close circle. Upon it laurels are strewn, and other branches which are similar to the myrtle, but yield to the Indians their balm (।)

▪ Upon it are served up fish and birds (।)

▪ there are also laid upon it whole lions and gazelles and swine and the loins of tigers; for they decline to eat the other parts of this animal, because they say that, as soon as it is born, it lifts up its front paws to the rising Sun (।)

▪ master of ceremonies rises and goes to the table, and he selects some of the viands for himself, and cuts off other portions, and then he goes back to his own chair (।)

▪ eats his full, constantly munching bread with it (।)

▪ goblets of silver and gold are brought in, each of which is enough for ten banqueters, and out of these they drink, stooping down like animals that are being watered (।)

▪ while they are drinking, they have brought in performers of various dangerous feats, not undeserving of serious study. For a boy, like one employed by dancing-girls, would be tossed lightly aloft, and at the same moment an arrow is aimed at him, up in the air, and when he was a long way from the ground, the boy would, by a tumblers’ leap, raise himself above the weapen, and if he missed his leap, he was sure to be hit (।)

▪ a man to mark the outline of his own son with arrows, as he stands in front of a board (।)

▪ they aim straight, even when they are drinking (।)

▪ Apollonius, who ate with the king, since they agreed in diet, was less interested in these feats and said to the king: “Tell me, O King, how you acquired such a command of the Greek tongue, and whence you derived all your philosophical attainments in this place? (।)

▪ In old days they would ask men who arrived by sea whether they were pirates, so common did they consider that way of living, hard though it is; but so far as I can make out, you Greeks ask your visitors whether they are not philosophers, so convinced you are that everyone you meet with must needs possess the divinest of human attainments (।)

▪ most of your philosophers are like people who have despoiled another man of his garment and then have dressed themselves up in it, although it does not fit them, and proceed to strut about trailing another man’s garment. Nay, by Zeus, just as robbers live in luxury (।)

▪ among us few engage in philosophy, and they are sifted and tried as follows: A young man so soon as he reaches the age of eighteen, and this I think is accounted the time of full age among you also, must pass across the river Hyphasis to the men who you are set upon visiting (।)

▪ particulars then of his parents and of their progenitors are gathered from witnesses and from the public archives. For whenever an Indian dies, there visits his house a particular authority charged by the law to make a record of him, and of how he lived. And if this officer lies or allows himself to be deceived, he is condemned by the law and forbidden ever to hold another office, on the ground that he has counterfeited a man’s life. (।)

▪ judgment and appraising his value in his eyebrows and cheeks, for from these features the dispositions of people can be detected by wise and scientific men (।)

▪ Indo-Greek and Parthian kings had to defend their country against the Kushans; they may be the barbarians referred to (।)

▪ my father’s kinsmen entertained apprehensions of him, because he was not yet sixteen years of age, so they sent him across the Hyphasis to the king there. And he has more subjects than I have, and his country is much more fertile than this one. This monarch wished to adopt him, but this my father declined on the ground that he would not struggle with fate that robbed him of his kingdom; but he besought to allow him to take his way to the sages and become a philosopher, for he said that this would make it easier for him to bear the reverses of his house. The king however being anxious to restore him to his father’s kingdom, my father said: “If you see that I am become a genuine philosopher, then restore me (।)

▪ king fell sick, and at the very moment when he was dying, he sent for my father, and appointed him co-heir in the government with his own son, and promised his daughter in marriage to him as she was already of marriageable age (।)

▪ having obtained her in marriage he lived hard by the sage in seven fertile village which the king bestowed upon his sister as her pin-money (।)

▪ my father after a Greek education brought me to the sages at an age somewhat too early perhaps, for I was only twelve at the time, but they brought me up like their own son; for any that they admit knowing the Greek tongue they are especially fond of, because they consider that in virtue of the similarity of his disposition he already belongs to themselves. (।)

▪ my good uncle had already taken away the villages, and didn’t even leave me the few acres my father had acquired; (maternal uncle)

▪ I was reading the play [by Euripides]The Children of Heracles (।)

▪ a man presented himself from my own country, bringing a letter from a person devoted to my father, who urged me to cross the river Hydraotes and confer with him about my present kingdom; for he said there was a good prospect of recovering it (।)

▪ I cannot but think that some god set me on reading this drama at the moment, and I followed the omen (।)

▪ one of the usurpers of the throne was dead, and that the other was besieged in this very palace. (।)

▪ recognizing my resemblance to my grandfather (।)

▪ they had daggers and bows (।)

▪ our numbers increased from day to day (।)

▪ they snatched up torches off the altar of the Sun and came before the gates and escorted me hither with many hymns in praise of my father and grandfather (।)

▪ the drone that was within they walled up, although I protested against his being put to such death.” (।)

▪ these sages: were they not once actually subject to Alexander, and were they not brought before him to philosophize about the heavens?”[1]
“Those were the Oxydracae,” he said, “and a race that has always been independent and well equipped for war; and they assert that they deal in wisdom, though they know nothing of value. But the genuine sages live between the Hyphasis and the Ganges, in a country which Alexander never assailed (brahmavarta kuruksetra delhi between hyphasis and ganges)

▪ Heracles of Egypt [3] and Dionysus after they had overrun the Indian people with their arms, at last attached them in company, and that they constructed engines of war, and tried to take the place by assault; but the sages, instead of taking the field against them, lay quiet and passive, as it seemed to the enemy; but as soon as the latter approached they were driven off by rockets of fire and thunderbolts which were hurled obliquely from above and fell upon their armor (taranatha buddhist tantrika beat turk in sindhu)

▪ Hercules lost his golden shield, and the sages dedicated it as an offering, partly out of respect for Hercules’ reputation, and partly because of the reliefs upon the shield (।)

▪ in these Hercules is represented fixing the frontier of the world at Gadira [Cadiz], and turning the mountains into pillars, and confining the ocean within its bounds. Thence it is clear that it was not the Theban Hercules, but the Egyptian one, that came to Gadira, and fixed the limits of the world.” (।)

▪ strain of the hymn sung to the pipe fell upon their ears, and Apollonius asked the king what was the meaning of their cheerful ode. “The Indians,” he answered, “sing their admonitions to the king, at the moment of his going to bed; and they pray that he may have good dreams, and rise up propitious and affable towards his subjects.” (।)

▪ I must allow it because of the law, although I do not require any admonition of the kind (।)

▪ you don’t think that those who drink water go to sleep?”
“Yes,” said the king, “they sleep, but with a very light sleep, which just sits upon the tips of their eyelids, as we say, but not upon their minds.” (।)

▪ unless the mind is thoroughly composed, the eyes will not admit of sleep either (।)

▪ madmen are not able to go to sleep because their mind leaps with excitement, and their thoughts run coursing hither and thither, so that their glances are full of fury and morbid impulse, like those of the dragons who never sleep. (।)

▪ drunkard, he, I admit, will not sleep at all, for his mind is in a state of revel, and whirls him about and fills him with uproar. All, I tell you, who try to go to sleep when in drink seem to themselves to be rushed up on the roof, and then to be dashed down to the ground (।)

▪ I do not put the case of a drunkard, but of a man who has merely drunk wine, but remains sober; I wish to consider whether he will sleep, and how much better he will sleep than a man who drinks no wine.” (।)

▪ Greeks distinguished several gods named Heracles, one of them being their own demigod, another one being born in Egypt, and a third one being identical to Krishna. (।)

▪ these men never nod, even though they pursue their studies far into the night (।)

▪ if the vision was seen in the first sleep or at midnight, when the soul is still immersed in the lees of wine and muddied thereby, they decline to make any suggestions, and they are wise. (।)

▪ a seer among the Greeks called Amphiaros.”
“I know,” said the other; “for you allude, I imagine, to the son of Oecles, who was swallowed up alive by the earth on his way back from Thebes.”
“This man, O king,” said Apollonius, “still divines in Attica, inducing dreams in those who consult him (।)

▪ priests take a man who wishes to consult him, and they prevent his eating for one day, and from drinking wine for three, in order that he may imbibe the oracles with his soul in a condition of utter transparency (।)

▪ Today I have not judged any, for the omens did not allow me (।)

▪ one man has sold to another land, in which there lay a treasure as yet undiscovered, and some time afterwards the land, being broken up, revealed a certain chest, which the person who sold the land says belongs to him rather than the other (।)

▪ I cannot believe that the gods would deprive the one even of his land, unless he was a bad man (।)

▪ seller was convicted of being a ruffian who had neglected the sacrifices, which it was his bounden duty to sacrifice to the gods on that land (।)

▪ Damis said: “O king, our friend here does not understand anything about our journey, nor about the races among which we shall find ourselves in future; but he regards our passage into India as mere child’s play, under the impression that he will everywhere have you and Vardanes to help him (।)

▪ if they collapse anywhere in the wilderness of India, we,” he continued, “shall have to sit down and drive off the vultures and wolves from the camels (।)

▪ king answered accordingly and said: “I will remedy this, for I will give you other camels, and you need four I think, and the satrap [1] ruling the Indus will send back four others to Babylon (।)

▪ I have a herd of camels on the Indus, all of them white (।)

▪ I will write a letter to Iarchas, the oldest of the sages (।)

▪ he would accept the linen robes, because they were like the cloaks worn by the ancient and genuine inhabitants of Attica (।)

▪ they took good handfuls of the gems, in order to dedicate them to the gods, whenever they should regain their own country (।)

▪ let him also see the throne, on which I sat, when you, Father Iarchas, bestowed on me the kingdom (।)

▪ gates therein that enclosed nothing, but had been erected to carry trophies. For there was set up on them a statue of Alexander standing in a four-poled chariot, as he looked when at Issus he confronted the Satraps of Darius. And at a short distance from one another there are said to have been built two gates, carrying the one a statue of Porus, and the other one of Alexander (।)

▪ having crossed the river Hydraotes and passed by several tribes, they reached the Hyphasis, and thirty stades away from this they came on altars bearing this inscription:
“To Father Ammon and Heracles his brother, and to Athena Providence and to Zeus of Olympus and to the Cabeiri of Samothrace and to the Indian Sun and to the Delphian Apollo.”
And they say there was also a brass column dedicated, and inscribed as follows:
Alexander stayed his steps at this point.
The altars we may suppose to be due to Alexander who so honored the limit of his Empire; but I fancy the Indians beyond the Hyphasis erected the column, by way of expressing their pride at Alexander’s having gone no further. (।)

▪ Hyphasis (।)

▪ as they advance they soon become impossible for boats, because spits of rock alternating with one another, rise up just below the surface (।)

▪ woods along the bank closely resemble those of the river in question, and a balm also is distilled from the trees, out of which the Indians make a nuptial ointment; and unless the people attending the wedding have besprinkled the young couple with this balm, the union is not considered complete nor compatible with Aphrodite (candana sandal)

▪ grove in the neighborhood of the river is dedicated to this goddess (aphrodite laksmi sakti)

▪ creature in this river which resembles a white worm. By melting down they make an oil, and from this oil, it appears, there is given off a flame such that nothing but glass can contain it. And this creature may be caught by the king alone, who utilizes it for the capture of cities; for as soon as the fat in question touches the battlements, a fire is kindled which defies all the ordinary means devised by men against combustibles. (।)

▪ wild asses [1] are also to be captured in these marshes, and these creatures have a horn upon the forehead (।)

▪ Indians make this horn into a cup (।)

▪ no one can ever fall sick on the day on which he has drunk out of it, nor will any one who has done so be the worse for being wounded, and he will be able to pass through fire unscathed, and he is even immune from poisonous draughts which others would drink to their harm (।)

▪ this goblet is reserved for kings, and the king alone may indulge in the chase of this creature (।)

▪ At this place they say that they also fell in with a woman who was black from her head to her bosom, but was altogether white from her bosom down to her feet; and the rest of the party fled from her believing her to be a monster, but Apollonius clasped the woman by the hand and understood what she was; for in fact such a woman in India is consecrated to Aphrodite, and a woman is born piebald in honor of this goddess, just as is Apis among the Egyptians. (।)

▪ they crossed the part of the Caucasus which stretches down to the Red Sea; and this range is thickly overgrown with aromatic shrubs. The spurs then of the mountain bear the cinnamon tree (।)

▪ apes is said to live in the recesses of the mountain and in any of its glens; and these apes are held in great esteem by the Indians, because they harvest the pepper for them, and they drive the lions off them with dogs and weapons (।)

▪ lions when they are past hunting stags and wild boars gobble up the apes (।)

▪ monkeys mark their actions from above out of their fastnesses, and when the night comes on they imitate the action of the Indians, and twisting off the twigs of the trees, they bring and throw them into the pits (।)

▪ beans three times as large as the Egyptian kind (।)

▪ “Indian ass” is Aristotle’s name for the rhinoceros (।)

▪ as they descended the mountain, they say they came in for a dragon hunt (।)

▪ whole of India is girt with dragons of enormous size; for not only the marshes are full of them, but the mountains as well, and there is not a single ridge without one (।)

▪ marsh kind are sluggish in their habits and are thirty cubits long, and they have no crest standing up on their heads, but in this respect resemble the she-dragons. Their backs however are very black, with fewer scales on them than the other kinds; and Homer has described them with deeper insight than have most poets, for he says that the dragon that lived hard by the spring in Aulis had a tawny back [Iliad 2.308] (।)

▪ dragons along the foothills and the mountain crests make their way into the plains after their quarry (।)

▪ These actually have a crest, of moderate extent and height when they are young; but as they reach their full size, it grows with them and extends to a considerable height, at which time also they turn red and get serrated backs. This kind also have beards, and lift their necks on high, while their scales glitter like silver; and the pupils of their eyes consist of a fiery stone, and they say that this has an uncanny power for many secret purposes. (।)

▪ plain specimen falls the prize of the hunters whenever it draws into its folds an elephant; for the destruction of both creatures is the result (।)

▪ those who capture the dragons are rewarded by getting the eyes and skin and teeth (।)

▪ dragons of the mountains have scales of a golden color (।)

▪ they give off a noise like the clashing of brass whenever they are burrowing under the earth (।)

▪ from their crests, which are all fiery red, there flashes a fire brighter than a torch (।)

▪ They embroider golden runes on a scarlet cloak, which they lay in front of the animal’s burrow after charming them the runes to cause sleep; for this is the only way to overcome the eyes of the dragon, which are otherwise inflexible (।)

▪ much mysterious lore is sung by them to overcome him (mantra)

▪ runes induce the dragon to stretch his neck out of his burrow and fall asleep over them (।)

▪ Indians fall upon him as he lies there, and dispatch him with blows of their axes, and having cut off the head they despoil it of its gems (।)

▪ in the heads of the mountain dragons there are stored away stones of flowery color, which flash out all kinds of hues, and possess a mystical power as resided in the ring, which they say belonged to Gyges.[1] (।)

▪ These are also said to inhabit the mountains in the neighborhood of the Red Sea (sylhet chittagong? bengal?)

▪ city under the mountain is of great size and is called Paraca, and that in the center of it are enshrined a great many heads of dragons, for the Indians who inhabit it are trained from their boyhood in this form of sport. And they are also said to acquire an understanding of the language and ideas of animals by feeding either on the heart or the liver of the dragon (gangadvara /ahicchatra?)

▪ From this point their road led for four days across a rich and well cultivated country, till they approached the castle of the sages (from gangadvara /ahicchatra to kanyakubja /magadha)

▪ king to whom the land is subject consults them about everything that he has to say or do, just as people who send to an oracle of a god (।)

▪ fairy tale told by Plato. Gyges was able to make himself invisible and became king of Lydia (।)

▪ halt in the neighboring village, which is hardly distant a single stade from the eminence occupied by the sages (।)

▪ youth run up to them, the blackest Indian they ever saw; and between his eyebrows was a crescent shaped spot which shone brightly (vaisnava sudra/abhira between 50 to 200)

▪ same feature was remarked in the case of Menon the pupil of Herod the Sophist, who was an Ethiop; it showed while he was a youth, but as he grew up to man’s estate its splendor waned and finally disappeared with his youth (।)

▪ Indian also wore, they say, a golden anchor, which is affected by Indians as a herald’s badge, because it holds all things fast. (।)

▪ he ran up to Apollonius and addressed him in the Greek tongue (।)

▪ all the inhabitants of the village spoke the Greek tongue (।)

▪ The word Masters at once had a Pythagorean ring for the ears of Apollonius and he gladly followed the messenger (guru in greek)

▪ hill the summit of which is inhabited by the sages is, according to the account of our travelers, of about the same height as the Acropolis of Athens; and it rises straight up from the plain, though its natural position equally secures it from attack, for the rock surrounds it on all sides. On many parts of this rock you see traces of cloven feet and outlines of beards and of faces, and here and there impressions of backs as of persons who had slipped and rolled down (mathura not kanyakubja)

▪ Dionysus, when he was trying to storm the place together with Heracles, ordered the Pans to attack it, thinking that they would be strong enough to stand the shock; but they were thunderstruck by the sages and fell one, one way, and another, another; and the rocks as it were took the print of the various postures in which they fell and failed. (dionysus heracles siva kubera yaksa)

▪ cloud floating round the eminence on which the Indians live and render themselves visible or invisible at will. Whether there were any other gates to the eminence they say they did not know; for the cloud around it did not anywhere allow them to be seen (।)

▪ he himself ascended mostly on the south side of the ridge, (।)

▪ well four fathoms deep, above the mouth of which there rose a sheen of deep blue light; and at midday when the sun was stationary about it, the sheen of light was always drawn up on high by the rays, and in its ascent assumed the look of a glowing rainbow. But he learnt afterwards that the soil underneath the well was composed of realgar (।)

▪ near this there was a crater, he says, of fire, which sent up a lead- colored flame, though it emitted no smoke or any smell, nor did this crater ever overflow, but emitted just matter enough not to bubble over the edges of the pit. It is here that the Indians purify themselves of involuntary sins, wherefore the sages call the well, the well of testing, and the fire, the fire of pardon. (sita through this9)

▪ two jars of black stone, of the rains and of the winds (।)

▪ jar of the rains, they say, is opened in case the land of India is suffering from drought, and sends up clouds to moisten the whole country; but if the rains should be in excess they are stopped by the jar being shut up (।)

▪ jar of the winds plays, I imagine, the same role as the bag of Aeolus:[1] (।)

▪ most ancient of the Greek Gods, a statue of Athena Polias and of Apollo of Delos and of Dionysus of Limnae and another of him of Amyclae (।)

▪ These were set up by these Indians and worshipped with Greek rites (।)

▪ they say that they are inhabiting the heart of India, as they regard the mound as the navel of this hill, and on it they worship fire with mysterious rites, deriving the fire, according to their own account, from the rays of the sun; and to the Sun they sing a hymn every day at midday (।)

▪ they made a practice of sleeping the ground (।)

▪ they strewed the ground with such grass as they might themselves prefer (।)

▪ levitating themselves two cubits high from the ground (।)

▪ miraculous display, for they disdain any such ambition (।)

▪ they regard any rites they perform, in thus quitting earth and walking with the Sun, as acts of homage acceptable to the God (।)

▪ they neither burn upon an altar nor keep in stoves the fire which they extract from the sun’s rays, although it is a material fire; but like the rays of sunlight when they are refracted in water, so this fire is seen raised aloft in the air and dancing in the ether (।)

▪ they pray to the Sun who governs the seasons by his might (।)

▪ All the springs which the Bacchanals see leaping up from the ground under their feet, whenever Dionysus stirs them and earth in a common convulsion, spring up in plenty for these Indians also when they are entertaining or being entertained (।)

▪ on principle they grow their hair long, as the Lacedaemonians did of old and the people of Thurium and Tarentum, as well as the Melians and all who set store by the fashions of Sparta; and they bind a white turban on their heads, and their feet are naked for walking and they cut their garments to resemble the exomis (।)

▪ material of which they make their raiment is a wool that springs wild from the ground [asbestos], white like that of the Pamphylians, though it is of softer growth, and a grease like olive oil distills from off it (।)

▪ if anyone else except these Indians tries to pluck it up, the earth refuses to surrender its wool (।)

▪ they all carry both a ring and a staff of which the peculiar virtues can effect all things, and the one and the other, so we learn, are prized as secrets (ekadandi, ring secret?)

▪ When Apollonius approached, the rest of the sages welcomed him and shook hands (m)

▪ Iarchas sat down on a high stool—and this was of black copper and chased with golden figures, while the seats of the others were of copper, but plain and not so high (।)

▪ O Apollonius, I perceive that you are well endowed with memory, a goddess whom we love more than any other of the divine beings.” (sarasvati?)

▪ they betook themselves to a spring of water, which Damis, who saw it subsequently, says resembles that of Dirce in Boeotia (।)

▪ first they stripped, and then they anointed their heads with an amber-like drug, which imparted such a warmth to these Indians, that their bodies steamed and the sweat ran off them as profusely as if they were washing themselves with fire; next they threw themselves into the water and, having so taken their bath (।)

▪ they betook themselves to the temple with wreaths upon their heads and full of sacred song (।)

▪ they stood round in the form of a chorus (।)

▪ chosen Iarchas as conductor (।)

▪ they struck the earth, uplifting their rods, and the earth arched itself like a billow of the sea and raised them up two cubits high into the air (।)

▪ they sang a song resembling the paean of Sophocles which they sing at Athens in honor of Asclepius (।)

▪ Iarchas called the stripling who carried the anchor (।)

▪ Bring out the throne of Phraotes for the wise Apollonius that he may sit upon it to converse with us (।)

▪ We know everything, just because we begin by knowing ourselves (।)

▪ “We consider ourselves to be Gods.”
Apollonius asked afresh: “Why?”
“Because,” said the other, “we are good men.” (।)

▪ This reply struck Apollonius as so instinct with trained good sense that he subsequently mentioned it to Domitian in his defense of himself. (।)

▪ what view do you take of the soul?”
“That,” replied the other, “which Pythagoras imparted to you, and which we imparted to the Egyptians.” (।)

▪ you imagine that the campaigners against Troy were the only heroes that ever were, and you forget other heroes both more numerous and more divine, whom your own country and that of the Egyptians and that of the Indians have produced (।)

▪ “I,” replied Apollonius, “regard Achilles, the son of Peleus and Thetis, as such, for he and no other is celebrated by Homer as excelling all the Achaeans in personal beauty and size (।)

▪ “With him,” said the other, “O Apollonius, I would have you compare my own ancestor, or rather my ancestral body, for that was the light in which Pythagoras regarded Euphorbus. (।)

▪ “There was then,” he said, “a time when the Ethiopians, an Indian race, dwelt in this country, and when Ethiopia as yet was not; but Egypt stretched its borders beyond Meroe and the cataracts, and on the one side included in itself the fountains of the Nile (ethiopian kusha)

▪ Ethiopians lived here, and were subject to King Ganges (kusha bhagiratha)

▪ when they slew this king, neither did the rest of the Indians regard them as pure, nor did the land permit them to remain upon it; for it spoiled the seed which they sowed in it before it came into ear, and it inflicted miscarriages on their women, and it gave a miserable feed to their flocks; and wherever they tried to found a city, it would give way sink down under their feet. Nay more, the ghost of Ganges drove them forward on their path, a haunting terror to their multitude, and it did not quit them until they atoned to earth by sacrificing the murderers who had shed the king’s blood with their hands (।)

▪ Ganges it seems, was ten cubits high (।)

▪ he was the son of the river Ganges; and when his own father inundated India, he himself turned the flood into the Red Sea, and effected a reconciliation between his father and the land, (erythrea sea: sagara | 
ganges: bhagirtatha | 
kapila | 
ethiopian: kusha |)

▪ he also repulsed the Scythians who once invaded this land across the Caucasus (।)

▪ he had formed an alliance with the king of the country, over which Phraotes now rules (।)

▪ According to the maxims of the Greek oracle at Delphi, all wisdom started with self-knowledge. (।)

▪ I am the person in question, as I clearly proved when I was four years old (।)

▪ this Ganges on one occasion fixed seven swords made of adamant in the earth, to prevent any monster approaching our country; now the gods ordered us to sacrifice if we came where he had implanted these weapons (।)

▪ mere child, and yet I led the interpreters of their will to a trench, and told them to dig there (।)

▪ pointed to a stripling of about twenty years of age, “who in natural aptitude for philosophy excels everyone, and he enjoys good health as you see, and is furnished with an excellent constitution; moreover he can endure fire and all sorts of cutting and wounding, yet in spite of all these advantages he detests philosophy.” (।)

▪ “He does not live with us,” replied the other, “but he has been caught like a lion against his will, and confined here, but he looks askance, at us when we try to domesticate him and caress him (।)

▪ this stripling was once Palamedes of Troy,[1] and he found his bitterest enemies in Odysseus and Homer; for the one laid an ambush against him of people by whom he was stoned to death, while the other denied him any place in his Epic [the Iliad] (।)

▪ he is Palamedes, for indeed he can write without having learned his letters (।)

▪ Pirates at one time infested the Phoenician Sea, and were hanging about the cities to pick up information about the cargoes which different people had (।)

▪ “have you a house?”
“A wretched hut,” I replied, “on the Island of Pharos, where once upon a time Proteus used to live.”[3] (।)

▪ “Would you like then,” they went on, “to acquire a landed estate instead of the sea, and a decent house instead of your hut, and ten times as much for the cargo as you are going to get now? (।)

▪ I did not aspire to become a pirate just at a time when I had made myself more expert than I ever had been, and had won crowns for my skill in my profession (।)

▪ our interview took place in a temple (।)

▪ I stipulated that it must all be paid me in current cash (।)

▪ Indian smiled and said: “You seem to think that mere abstention from injustice constitutes justice, and I am of opinion that all Greeks do the same (।)

▪ I once learned from the Egyptians that come hither (।)

▪ governors from Rome are in the habit of visiting your country, brandishing their axes naked over your heads, before they know they have bad men to rule or not; but you acknowledge them to be just if they merely do not sell justice. (।)

▪ slave merchants yonder do exactly the same; for when they come to you with convoys of Carian slaves and are anxious to recommend their characters to you, they make it a great merit of the slaves that they do not steal (।)

▪ Minos, a man who exceeded all men in cruelty, and who enslaved with his navies the inhabitants of continent and islands alike, and yet they honor him by placing in his hand a scepter of justice and give him a throne in Hades to be umpire of spirits (।)

▪ they deny food and drink to Tantalus, merely because he was a good man and inclined to share with his friends the immortality bestowed upon them by the Gods (amrta)

▪ some of them hang stones over him, and rain insults of a terrible kind upon this divine and good man (।)

▪ I would much rather that they had represented him as swimming in a lake of nectar, for he regaled men with that drink humanely and ungrudgingly.” (।)

▪ he pointed out a statue which stood upon his left hand, on which was inscribed the name “Tantalus”. (।)

▪ this statue was four cubits high, and represented a man of fifty years who was clad in the fashion of Argolis, though he differed in his cloak, that being like a Thessalian’s, and he held a cup sufficient at least for one thirsty man and drank your health therefrom, and in the goblet was a liquor, an unmixed draught which frothed and foamed, though without bubbling over the edge of the cup. (।)

▪ we must not suppose that he was really the victim of the gods’ dislike, for, had he been hateful to them, he would never have been judged by the Indians to be a good man (।)

▪ Greek hero Palamedes was credited with several inventions, such as dice, measures, and numbers. Because he was also believed by some to have invented the alphabet, he became some sort of patron saint for sophists like Philostratus. (।)

▪ king had arrived equipped in the height of Median fashion (।)

▪ he will not eat any living creature, for it is wrong to do here, but only dried fruits and roots and the seasonable produce of the Indian land at this time of year, and whatever else the new year’s seasons will provide.” (।)

▪ king advanced together with his brother and his son, ablaze with gold and jewels (।)

▪ Damis himself says that he was not present on this occasion, because on that day he was staying in the village, but he heard from Apollonius what happened and wrote it in his book (।)

▪ king extended his hand as if in prayer to the sages and they nodded their assent as if they were conceding his request; and he was transported with joy at the promise (।)

▪ Thereupon four tripods stepped forth like those of the Pythian Temple, but of their own accord, like those which advanced in Homer’s poem [Iliad 18.375], and upon them were cup-bearers of black brass resembling the figures of Ganymede and of Pelops among the Greeks (।)

▪ earth strewed beneath them grass softer than any mattress (।)

▪ dried fruits and bread and vegetables and the dessert of the season all came in, served in order, and set before them more agreeably that if cooks and waiters had provided it (।)

▪ two of the tripods flowed with wine, but the other two supplied, the one of them a jet of warm water and the other of cold (।)

▪ precious stones imported from India are employed in Greece for necklaces and rings because they are so small, but among the Indians they are turned into decanters and wine coolers, because they are so large, and into goblets of such size that from a single one of them four persons can slake their thirst at midsummer (।)

▪ cup-bearers of bronze drew a mixture, he says, of wine and water made in due proportions (।)

▪ they pushed cups round, just as they do in drinking bouts (।)

▪ It is no great compliment you have paid him,” answered the king, “by saying that he has embraced a mode of life which has denied even to Phraotes the chance of being a noble man (।)

▪ Apollonius, who found an interpreter in Iarchas said: “And what have you gained, O king, by refusing to be a philosopher?”
“What have I gained? Why, the whole of virtue and the identification of myself with the Sun.” (।)

▪ “And you,” replied the king, “since you are a philosopher, what is your fancy about yourself, my fine fellow?”
“That I may pass,” replied Apollonius, “for being a good man, if only I can be a philosopher.”
Thereupon the king stretched out his hand to heaven and exclaimed: “By the Sun, you come here full of Phraotes.” (।)

▪ he wished to write to you in my behalf, but since he declared that you were a good man, I begged him not to take the trouble of writing, seeing that in his case no one sent a letter commending me.” (।)

▪ having heard that he himself was praised by Phraotes, he not only dropped his suspicions, but lowering his tone he said: “Welcome, goodly stranger.” (।)

▪ about myself, O stranger”; said the king, “what is said among Hellenes?”
“Why, as much,” said Apollonius, “as is said about the Hellenes here.”
“As for myself, I find nothing in the Hellenes,” said the other, “that is worth speaking of.”
“I will tell them that,” said Apollonius, “and they will crown you at Olympia.” (।)

▪ sages were eighteen in number (।)

▪ when my grandfather was enrolled among these wise men, the youngest of them all, they were seventy in number but when he reached his 130th year, he was left here all alone (।)

▪ Egyptians accordingly wrote and congratulated him warmly on being left alone for four years in his tenure of this throne, but he begged them to cease reproaching the Indians for the paucity of their sages (।)

▪ we, O Apollonius, have heard from the Egyptians of the custom of the Eleans, and that the Hellanodicae, who preside over the Olympic games, are ten in number; but we do not approve of the rule imposed in the case of these men; for they leave the choice of them to the lot, and the lot has no discernment (।)

▪ king kept trying to interrupt them, constantly breaking off their every sentence by his silly and ignorant remarks (।)

▪ Apollonius replied: “We are discussing matters important and held in great repute among the Hellenes; though you would think of them but slightly, for you say that you detest everything Hellenic.”
“I do certainly detest them,” he said, “but nevertheless I want to hear; for I imagine you are talking about those Athenians the slaves of Xerxes.” (।)

▪ Have you, O King, any slaves?”
“Twenty thousand,” said the other, “and not a single one of them did I buy myself, but they were all born in my household.” (।)

▪ visitors who come hither from Egypt, O guest,” replied the king, “malign the race of Hellenes, and while declaring that they themselves are holy men and wise, and the true law-givers who fixed all the sacrifices and rites of initiation which are in vogue among the Greeks, they deny to the latter any and every sort of good quality, declaring them to be ruffians, and a mixed herd addicted to every sort of anarchy, and lovers of legend and miracle mongers, and though indeed poor, yet making their poverty not a title of dignity, but a mere excuse for stealing (।)

▪ will never set trust in another Egyptian (।)

▪ let us now proceed to quaff the good cheer provided by Tantalus (।)

▪ he set an example to this fellow guests, by stooping the first of them all to the goblet which indeed furnished an ample draught for all; for the stream refilled itself plenteously, as if with spring waters welling up from the ground (।)

▪ this cup is instituted by the Indians as a cup of friendship; and they feign that Tantalus is the wine-bearer who supplies it, because he is considered to have been the most friendly of men. (।)

▪ when it was midnight they rose up and first they sang a hymn to the ray of light, suspended aloft in the air as they had been at midday (।)

▪ at daybreak offered his sacrifice, the king (।)

▪ Iarchas said to the messenger: “We admit Damis also hither to our mysteries; so let him come, but do you look after the rest of them in the village.” (।)

▪ “And how can there be a fifth,” said Apollonius, “alongside of water and air and earth and fire?”
“There is the ether”, replied the other, “which we must regard as the stuff of which gods are made; for just as all mortal creatures inhale the air, so do immortal and divine natures inhale the ether.” (।)

▪ Apollonius again asked which of the elements came first into being, and Iarchas answered: “All are simultaneous, for a living creature is not born bit by bit.” (।)

▪ “Am I,” said Apollonius, “to regard the universe as a living creature?”
“Yes,” said the other, “if you have a sound knowledge of it, for it engenders all living things.” (।)

▪ “Shall I then,” said Apollonius, “call the universe female, or of both the male and the opposite gender?”
“Of both genders,” said the other, “for by commerce with itself it fulfills the role both of mother and father in bringing forth living creatures; and it is possessed by a love for itself more intense than any separate being has for its fellow (।)

▪ parts of the universe also as adapting themselves through its inherent soul to all creatures which are brought forth or conceived (।)

▪ sufferings so often caused by drought are visited on us in accordance with the soul of the universe, whenever justice has fallen into disrepute and is disowned by men (।)

▪ ancient law in regard to the Red Sea, which the king Erythras laid down, when he held sway over that sea, to the effect that the Egyptians should not enter it with a vessel of war, and indeed should employ only a single merchant ship (।)

▪ obliged the Egyptians to contrive a ship equivalent to several at once of those which other races have (।)

▪ several pilots in this boat and subordinated them to the oldest and wisest of their number, to conduct the voyage (।)

▪ in the crew of this ship there was a detachment of armed men, for it is necessary to equip the ship and protect it against the savages of the Gulf that live on the right hand as you enter it, in case they should ever attack and plunder it on the high seas. (।)

▪ you must apportion the first and supreme position to God the begetter of this animal, and subordinate posts to the gods who govern its parts (।)

▪ we shall do well to separate from the universe the region under the earth, if there is one, because the poets represent it as an abode of terror and corruption.” (।)

▪ Iarchas replied: “If the land be compared with the sea it will be found to be bigger, for it includes the sea in itself; but if it be considered in relation to the entire mass of water, we can show that the earth is the lesser of the two, for it is upheld by the water.”[1] (।)

▪ poor woman who interceded in behalf of her child, who was, she said, a boy of sixteen years of age, but had been for two years possessed by a devil. (।)

▪ boy does not even retain his own voice, but speaks in a deep hollow tone, as men do; and he looks at you with other eyes rather than with his own (।)

▪ demon discovered himself using my child as a mask, and what he told me was this, that he was the ghost of man, who fell long ago in battle, but that at death he was passionately attached to his wife. Now he had been dead for only three days when his wife insulted their union by marrying another man, and the consequence was that he had come to detest the love of women, and had transferred himself wholly into this boy (।)

▪ he promised, if I would only not denounce him to yourselves, to endow the child with many noble blessings (।)

▪ he has put me off and off for such a long time now, that he has got sole control of my household, yet has no honest or true intentions (।)

▪ demon had threatened her with steep places and precipices and declared that he would kill her son, “in case”, she added, “I haled him hither for trial.” (।)

▪ He bade the man, whenever his wife should be about to bring forth her next child, to enter her chamber carrying in his bosom a live hare; then he was to walk once round her and at the same moment to release the hare; for that the womb would be extruded together with the fetus, unless the hare was at once driven out. (।)

▪ Your children,” he added, “must therefore abstain from wine, but in order that they may be never led even to desire wine, supposing you should have another boy, and I perceive you had one only six days ago, you must carefully watch the hen owl and find where it builds its nest; then you must snatch its eggs and give them to the child to chew after boiling them properly; for if it is fed upon these, before it tastes wine, a distaste for wine will be bred in it (।)

▪ Damis says that Apollonius alone partook of the philosophic discussion together with Iarchas, and that Apollonius embodied the results in four books concerning the divination by the stars, a work which Moeragenes has mentioned (yona sastra)

▪ Damis says that he composed a work on the way to offer sacrifice to the several gods in a manner pleasing to them. (।)

▪ I found the treatise On sacrifice in several cities, and in the houses of several learned men (।)

▪ Iarchas gave seven rings to Apollonius named after the seven stars [i.e., the planets], and that Apollonius wore each of these in turn on the day of the week which bore its name. (।)

▪ not be surprised, if you comprehend the science, seeing that you carry in your soul so much ether.” (।)

▪ turned to Damis and said playfully: “And you, O Assyrian, have you no foreknowledge of anything (।)

▪ I do not think that men without the forecasts of a prophetic wisdom would ever have ventured to mingle with medicines that save life these most deadly of poisons.” (।)

But they have no great power of flying, not more than have birds of short flight; for they are not winged as is proper with birds, but the palms of their feet are webbed with red membranes, such that they are able to revolve them, and make a flight and fight in the air; and the tiger alone is beyond their powers of attack, (।)

▪ embarked upon the ship and was borne away by a smooth and favorable breeze, and he was struck at the formidable manner in which the Hyphasis discharges itself into the sea [1] at its mouth; for in its later course, as I said before, it falls into rocky and narrow places and over precipices (without guide calling indus /sarasvati hyphasis)

Then its pierced with a long pin and discharges a peculiar liquid called ichor,[3] which the man catches in the iron block which is hollowed out in regular holes.

▪ when he came to Smyrna the Ionians went out to meet him, for they were just celebrating the pan-Ionian sacrifices (।)

▪ he there read a decree of the Ionians, in which they besought him to take part in their solemn meeting; and in it he met with a name which had not at all an Ionian ring, for a certain Lucullus [1] had signed the resolution.

▪ course run by diseases in Gadeira; for at the time of high water the souls of the dying do not quit the bodies, and this would hardly happen, he says, unless the influence or spirit I have spoken of was also advancing towards the land. (।)

▪ They also tell you of certain phenomena of the ocean in connection with the phases of the moon (।)

▪ Gadeira is situated at the extreme end of Europe, and its inhabitants are excessively given to religion; so much so that they have set up an altar to old age, and unlike any other race they sing hymns in honor of death; and altars are found there set up to poverty, and to art (।)

▪ and to Heracles of Egypt (।)

▪ Heracles the Theban (।)

▪ island on which the shrine is built is of exactly the same size as the temple (।)

▪ shrine they say there is maintained a cult both of one and the other Heracles,[2] though there are no images of them; altars however there are, namely, to the Egyptian Heracles two of bronze and perfectly plain, to the Theban, one of stone (।)

▪ on the latter they say are engraved in relief hydras and the mares of Diomedes and the twelve labors of Heracles. (।)

▪ golden olive of Pygmalion, it too is preserved in the temple of Heracles, and it excited their admiration by the clever way in which the branch work was imitated; and they were still more astonished at its fruit, for this teemed with emeralds (।)

▪ pillars in the temple were made of gold and silver smelted together so as to be of one color, and they were over a cubit high, of square form, resembling anvils (।)

▪ their capitals were inscribed with letters which were neither Egyptian nor Indian nor of any kind which he could decipher (linear? they would recognize phoenician)

▪ priests would tell him nothing (secret language cult, apollonius degenerator)

▪ These pillars are ties between earth and ocean, and they were inscribed by Heracles in the house of the Fates, to prevent any discord arising between the elements, and to save their mutual affection for one another from violation (।)

▪ Greeks distinguished several gods named Heracles, one of them being their own demigod, another one being born in Egypt. The Heracles of Gadeira was, in fact, the Phoenician god Melqart. (।)

▪ Attica in the autumn season when the mysteries are celebrated (halloween)

▪ swift runner arrived at Gadeira, and ordered them to offer sacrifices for the good tidings, and to sing hymns in honor of Nero (।)

▪ But the cities in the neighborhood of Gadeira neither knew what the Olympic Festival was, nor what a contest nor an arena meant; nor did they understand what they were sacrificing for, but they indulged in the most ridiculous suppositions, and imagined that it was a victory in war that Nero had won and that he had taken captive some men called Olympians; for they had never been spectators either of a tragedy or of a harp-playing performance. (।)

▪ Damis indeed speaks of the singular effect which a tragic actor produced upon the minds of the inhabitants of Ipola,[2] which is a city of Baetica (।)

▪ actor of tragedy, who was one of those that had not ventured to contend for the prize against Nero, was on a strolling tour round the cities of the west, and by his histrionic talent he had won no small fame among the less barbarous of the populations (।)

▪ But when he appeared at Ipola, they showed some fear of him before he ever opened his lips upon the stage, and they shrank in dismay at his appearance when they saw him striding across the stage, with his mouth all agape, mounted on buskins extra high, and clad in the most wonderful garments; but when he lifted up his voice and bellowed out loud, most of them took to their heels, as if they had a demon yelling at them (।)

▪ governor of Baetica was very anxious to have a conversation with Apollonius (।)

▪ the latter said that his conversation must seem tedious to any but philosophers (।)

▪ after three days spent in private conversations, the governor went away, after embracing Apollonius, while the latter said: “Farewell, and do not forget Vindex.” (।)

▪ When Nero was singing in Achaea, Vindex is said to have stirred up against him the nations of the West (।)

▪ Apollonius, forecasting how all this must be, had accordingly brought into line with Vindex the governor of a neighboring province, and so all but took up arms himself in behalf of Rome. (।)

▪ Apollonius and his friends returned thence towards Libya and the Tyrrhenian land; and, partly on foot and partly by sea, they made their way to Sicily, where they stopped at Lilybaeum. Then they coasted along to Messina and to the Straits, where the junction of the Tyrrhenian Sea with the Adriatic gives rise to the dangers of the Charybdis (।)

▪ wizards, whom for my part I reckon to be the most unfortunate of mankind, claim to alter the course of destiny, by having recourse either to the torture of lost spirits or to barbaric sacrifices, or to certain incantations or anointings (।)

▪ when they reached Syracuse a woman of a leading family was brought to bed of such a monster as never any woman had delivered of before: for her child had three heads (।)

▪ Catana, where is Mount Etna; and they say that they heard from the inhabitants of the city a story about [the mythological monster] Typho being bound on the spot and about fire rising from him, and this fire sends up the smoke of Etna (।)

▪ those others, of which all poetry is so fond, and which deal with heroes, positively destroy the souls of their hearers, because the poet relates stories of outlandish passion and of incestuous marriages, and repeats calumnies against the gods (।)

▪ Aesop on the other hand had in the first place the wisdom never to identify himself with those who put such stories into verse, but took a line of his own; and in the second, like those who dine well off the plainest dishes, he made use of humble incidents to teach great truths (।)

▪ poets are; for the latter do violence to their own stories in order to make them probable (।)

▪ poet, after telling his story, leaves a healthy-minded reader cudgeling his brains to know whether it really happened; whereas one who, like Aesop, tells a story which is false and does not pretend to be anything else (।)

▪ being brought up from childhood with these stories, and after being as it were nursed by them from babyhood, we acquire certain opinions of the several animals and think of some of them as royal animals, of others as silly, of others as witty, and others as innocent. (।)

▪ my mother taught me a story about the wisdom of Aesop when I was a mere child (।)

▪ he was once a shepherd, and was tending his flocks hard by a temple of Hermes (।)

▪ Aesop, she said, was not in a position to own any of these things; but he saved up what he had, and poured a libation of as much milk as a sheep would give at one milking in honor of Hermes, and brought a honeycomb and laid it on the altar, big enough to fill the hand, and he thought too of regaling the god with myrtle berries, or perhaps by laying just a few roses or violets at the altar. (।)

▪ Hermes as the god of wisdom and eloquence and also of gain and profit, said (।)

▪ he remembered the Hours, by whom he himself had been nurtured on the peaks of Olympus (।)

▪ Do you keep what was the first thing I learnt myself (।)

▪ Hermes, still a child, stole Apollo’s cows. (।)

▪ I admit that giants have existed, and that gigantic bodies are revealed all over earth when tombs are broken open (।)

▪ I deny that they ever came into conflict with the gods; at the most they violated their temples and statues (।)

▪ Apollonius asked him what his freight consisted of. “Of gods,” he replied, “whose images I am exporting to Ionia (idol exported fron tripura to srisila myanmar)

▪ answered Apollonius, “for you appear to me to be an Athenian, that on the ships which your countrymen employed against the barbarians, although they were full of a disorderly naval crowd, the gods embarked along with them, yet had no suspicion of being polluted thereby (।)

▪ image-makers of old behaved not in this way, nor did they go round the cities selling their gods. All they did was to export their own hands and their tools for working stone and ivory; others provided the raw materials, while they plied their handicraft in the temples themselves; (visvakarma)

▪ I will roast a bull to ashes this very day, and you shall hold communion with us in the smoke it makes (।)

▪ Iamidae and the Telliadae and the Clytiadae and the oracle of the black-footed ones, have they talked a lot of nonsense, most excellent priest, when they went on at such length about fire, and pretended to gather so many oracles from it? For as to the fire from pine wood and from the cedar, do you think it is really fraught with prophecy and capable of revealing anything, and yet not esteem a fire lit from the richest and purest gum to be much preferable?

▪ Alexandrians are devoted to horses, and flock into the racecourse to see the spectacle, and murder one another in their partisanship (।)

▪ Roman general] Vespasian [who had been sent out to subdue the Jewish revolt] was harboring thoughts of seizing absolute power (।)

▪ when he advanced as far as Egypt (।)

▪ When the autocrat approached the city [in the autumn of 69], the priests met him before the gates, together with the magistrates of Egypt [3] and the representatives of the different provinces into which Egypt is divided. The philosophers also were present and all their schools. (।)

▪ Vitellius uses more ointment in his bath than I do water, and I believe that if you ran a sword into him, more ointment would issue from the wound than blood (।)

▪ he left the emperor’s presence, saying that it was not permitted him by the religion of the Indians to proceed at midday in any other way than the Indians do themselves (।)

▪ first reference to a monarch praying to a philosopher in western literature. In fact, Philostratus (or, more probably, his source Damis) introduces a new notion of the relationship between kings and philosophers. (।)

▪ propagandists of Vespasian said that Vitellius had been one of the children who had performed sexual games in the palace of Tiberius. (।)

▪ While Apollonius spoke, Euphrates concealed the jealousy (।)

▪ myself, I quite approve of the deposition of Vitellius, whom I know to be a ruffian drunk with every sort of profligacy (।)

▪ playing the tyrant comes natural to young men as wine or women (।)

▪ we cannot reproach a young man merely for making himself a tyrant, unless in pursuit of his role he shows himself a murderer, a ruffian, or a debauchee (।)

▪ when an old man makes himself a tyrant, the first thing we blame in him is that he ever nursed such an ambition. (।)

▪ men will believe that he nursed the ambition long before, when he was still a stripling, only that he failed to realize it; and such failures are partly attributed to ill luck, partly to pusillanimity (।)

▪ How escape the reproach of having been afraid of Nero, the most cowardly and supine of rulers? (।)

▪ Look at the revolt against him planned by Vindex, you surely were the man of the hour, its natural leader, not he! For you had an army at your back, and the forces you were leading against the Jews (।)

▪ Jews have long been in revolt not only against the Romans, but against humanity; and a race that has made its own a life apart and irreconcilable, that cannot share with the rest of mankind in the pleasures of the table nor join in their libations or prayers or sacrifices, are separated from ourselves by a greater gulf than divides us from Susa or Bactra or the more distant Indies (।)

▪ Put then an end to monarchy, of which you have repeated to us so evil a record; and bestow upon Romans a popular government, and on yourself the glory of inaugurating for them a reign of liberty.” (।)

▪ Throughout Euphrates’ long speech, Apollonius noticed that Dion shared his sentiments, for he manifested his approval both by his gestures and the applause with which he hailed his words (।)

▪ while I welcome the idea of democracy -for though this form of polity is inferior to an aristocracy, nevertheless moderate men will prefer it to tyrannies and oligarchies (।)

▪ servility to which these successive tyrannies have reduced the Romans will render any change difficult to effect (।)

▪ I would fain see you give the people of Rome the right to choose their own polity, and, if they choose a democracy, allow it them. (।)

▪ when we regard the eminent man before us, and think of the enormous army at his disposal, of the glint of their brazen arms, of his clouds of cavalry, of his own personal qualities, of his generosity, self-restraint, of his fitness to attain his object—ought we not to send him forward on the path that leads to his goal, with favoring encouragement, and with more auspicious pledges (apollonius a simp)

▪ Philostratus’ own invention: a constitutional debate between several (usual three) advisers. The theme is old: the Histories by Herodotus of Halicarnassus already contain a discussion about the best constitution, and Cassius Dio offers us a similar debate in his description of the reign of Augustus. Flavius Josephus has the Senate debate a return to the republic after the death of Caligula. (।)

▪ Mow not down the loftier stalks which overtop the rest, for this maxim of Aristotle’s is unjust; but try rather to pluck disaffection out of men’s hearts, as you would tares out of your cornfields; and inspire awe of yourself in revolutionists less by actual punishment than by showing them that they will not go unpunished. (।)

▪ Let your disciplining of them even proceed the to length of threatening not to bequeath them your throne, unless they remain good men and honest; otherwise they will be prone to regard it not as a reward of excellence so much as a mere heritage. (।)

▪ it is not easy to convert an entire people on a sudden to wisdom and temperance; but you must feel your way and instill order and rhythm in their characters step by step, partly by open, partly by secret correction. (।)

▪ During the period in which I lived in the Peloponnese Hellas was governed by a man who knew as little of the Hellenes and their tongue as they understood of his. What was the result? He was in his mistakes as much sinned against as sinner, for his assessors and those who shared with him judicial authority trafficked in justice, and abused his authority as if he had been not their governor but their slave. (।)

▪ Euphrates declared his assent to all these conclusions, “For,” said he, “what can I gain by continuing to oppose such teaching? (।)

▪ I have only one thing left to say, and that is that while you approve and countenance that philosophy which accords with nature, you should have nothing to do with that which affects a secret intercourse with the gods, for we are easily puffed up by the many absurdities this lying philosophy falsely ascribes to providence.” (euphrates actually good)

▪ Euphrates failed to see that he only prejudiced himself, and gained with the emperor the reputation of being a jealous and insolent fellow, who aired these sentiments in favor of democracy, not because he really entertained them, but only by way of contradicting the opinions Apollonius held in regard to the empire (।)

▪ Apollonius the emperor nor merely loved for his own sake, but was ever ready to listen to his accounts of antiquity, to his descriptions of the Indian Phraotes, and to his graphic stories of the rivers of India, and of the animals that inhabit it; above all to the forecasts and revelations imparted to him by the gods concerning the future of the empire (।)

▪ “Lasthenes,” replied Dion, “of Apamea, a Bithynian city, who was my companion in philosophy, fell in love with the uniform and took to a soldier’s life. Now, he says, he longs afresh to wear the sage’s cloak, so would you let him out from the service (।)

▪ “Let him be released,” said the emperor, “but I confer on him the rights of a veteran, since he is equally fond of wisdom and of yourself.” (।)

▪ emperor turned to Euphrates, who had drawn up a letter embodying his requests, and held it out in expectation that his sovereign would peruse it in private. But the latter was determined to expose him to criticism, so he read it out loud before everyone (।)

▪ Nero restored the liberties of Hellas with a wisdom and moderation quite alien to his character; and the cities regained their Doric and Attic characteristics (।)

▪ Vespasian, however, on his arrival in the country took away her liberty, alleging their factiousness with other pretexts hardly justifying such extreme severity. (।)

▪ a man [who] led a tame lion about by a string, as if it had been a dog; and the animal not only fawned upon him, but on anyone who approached it. It went collecting alms all around the towns, and was admitted even in the temples, being a pure animal; for it never licked up the blood of the victims, nor pounced on them when they were being flayed and cut up, but lived upon honeycakes and bread and dried fruits and cooked meat; and you also came on it drinking wine without losing its character. (।)

▪ Apollonius exclaimed: “This lion is begging me to make you understand that a human soil is within him, the soul namely of Amasis, the king of Egypt in the province of Sais.”[1] (।)

▪ “I think the lion ought to be sent to Leontopolis [“Lion’s city”] and dedicated to the temple there [of the god Mihos], (।)

▪ priests met and offered sacrifice to Amasis; and having decorated the animal with a collar and ribbons, they conveyed him up country into Egypt with pipings, hymns and songs composed in his honor. (।)

▪ they departed straight for the pyramids, mounted on camels [2] and keeping the Nile on their right hand. In several places they took boats across the river in order to visit every sight on it (।)

▪ Indus and the Nile, resemble one another, if we consider their creatures. For they both spread their moisture over the land in the summer season, when the earth most wants it, and unlike all other rivers they produced the crocodile and the river-horse [hippopotamus]; and the religious rites celebrated over them correspond with one another, for many of the religious invocations of the Indians are repeated in the case of the Nile. (।)

▪ proof of the similarity of the two countries in the spices which are found in them (।)

▪ lion and the elephant are captured and confined in both the one and the other (।)

▪ They are also the haunts of animals not found elsewhere, and of black men -a feature not found in other continents—and we meet in them with races of pigmies and of people who bark in various ways instead of talking (।)

▪ griffins of the Indians and the ants of the Ethiopians, though they are dissimilar in form, yet, from what we hear, play similar parts; for in each country they are the guardians of gold (yaksa)

▪ confines of Ethiopia and Egypt, and the name of the place is Sycaminus,[3] he came across a quantity of uncoined gold and linen and an elephant and various roots and myrrh and spices, which are all lying without anyone to watch them at the crossways.
I will explain the meaning of this, for the same custom still survives among ourselves. It was a market place to which the the Ethiopians bring all the products of their country; and the Egyptians in their turn take them all away and bring to the same spot their own wares of equal value (।)

▪ inhabitants of the marches are not yet fully black but are half- breeds in matter of color, for they are partly not so black as the Ethiopians, yet partly more so than the Egyptians (।)

▪ our good Hellenes: they pretend they cannot live unless one penny begets another and unless they can force up the price of their goods by chaffering or holding them back; and one pretends that he has got a daughter whom it is time to marry, and another that he has got a son who has just reached manhood, and a third that he has to pay his subscription to his club, and a fourth that he is having a house built for him, and a fifth that he would be ashamed of being thought a worse man of business than his father (south asia)

▪ splendid thing then it would be, if wealth were held in less honor and equality flourished a little more and ‘if the black iron were left to rust in the ground,’[4] (।)

▪ Timasion was the name of this stripling, who was just emerging from boyhood, and was now in the prime of life and strength. He had a stepmother who had fallen in love with him;[5] and when he rejected her overtures, she set upon him and by way of spiting him had poisoned his father’s mind against him (।)

▪ she accused him of being effeminate, and of finding his pleasure in pederasts rather than in women (।)

▪ He had accordingly abandoned Naucratis,[7] for it was there that all this happened, and was living in the neighborhood of Memphis (।)

▪ had acquired and manned a boat of his own and was plying as a waterman on the Nile (।)

▪ when the ships were alongside of one another, Timasion stepped out of his boat, and after addressing a word or two to his pilot, about the cargo in his own boat, he greeted the company (।)

▪ Apollonius said: “Do you sacrifice to Aphrodite, my boy?”
And Timasion answered: “Yes, by Zeus, every day; (।)

▪ sacred enclosure of Memnon, of whom Damis gives the following account. He says that he was the son of the Dawn, and that he did not meet his death in Troy, where indeed he never went; but that he died in Ethiopia after ruling the land for five generations. But his countrymen being the longest lived of men, still mourn him as a mere youth and deplore his untimely death. (hyksos?)

▪ place in which his statue is set up resembles, they tell us, an ancient market-place, such as remain in cities that were long ago inhabited, and where we come on broken stumps and fragments of columns, and find traces of walls as well as seats and jambs of doors, and images of Hermes, some destroyed by the hand of man, others by that of time (।)

▪ this statue, says Damis, was turned towards the sunrise, and was that of a youth still unbearded; and it was made of a black stone, and the two feet were joined together after the style in which statues were made in the time of [the legendary artist] Daedalus; and the arms of the figure were perpendicular to the seat pressing upon it, for though the figure was still sitting it was represented in the very act of rising up.
We hear much of this attitude of the statue, and of the expression of its eyes, and of how the lips seem about to speak; (।)

▪ exactly at dawn, they could not restrain their admiration; for the lips spoke immediately [when] the sun’s ray touched them, and the eyes seemd to stand out (।)

▪ man wearing the garb of the inhabitants of Memphis, but who was wandering (।)

▪ laws of Memphis prescribe that a person exiled for an involuntary offense of this kind, -and the penalty is exile,—should remain with the naked philosophers until he has washed away the guilt of bloodshed, and then he may return home as soon as he is pure, though he must first go to the tomb of the slain man and sacrifice there some trifling victim. Now until he has been received by the naked philosophers, so long he must roam about these marches (।)

▪ Said Apollonius: “You don’t call men wise, who refuse to purify him, and are not aware that Philiscus whom he slew was a descendant of Thamus the Egyptian (inherited sin)

▪ Thamus once on a time was intriguing against the inhabitants of Memphis, and these philosophers detected his plot and prevented him; and he having failed in his enterprise retaliated by laying waste all the land upon which they live (।)

▪ it is not allowed me by my religion to address one who is stained with blood (।)

▪ when the man in question came, Apollonius went through the rites over him which Empedocles and Pythagoras prescribe for the purification of such offenses (।)

▪ naked sages, who dwell, they relate, upon a moderate-sized hill a little way from the bank of the Nile; and in point of wisdom they fall short of the Indians rather more than they excel the Egyptians (।)

▪ they wear next to no clothes in the same way as people do at Athens in the heat of summer (।)

▪ in their district there are few trees (।)

▪ certain grove of no great size to which they resort when they meet for the transaction of common affairs; but they do not build their shrines in one and the same place, as Indian shrines are built, but one is in one part of the hill and another in another (।)

▪ Nile is the chief object of their worship, for they regard this river as land and water at once (।)

▪ They have no need, however, of hut or dwelling, because they live in the open air directly under the heaven itself (jaina digambara)

▪ they have built an hospice to accommodate strangers (।)

▪ Euphrates had heard Apollonius often say that he wished to compare the wisdom of India with that of Egypt, so he sent up to the naked sages one Thrasybulus, a native of Naucratis, to take away our sage’s character. (।)

▪ Thrasybulus at the same time that he pretended to have come there in order to enjoy their society, told them that the sage of Tyana would presently arrive, and that they would have no little trouble with him, because he esteemed himself more highly than the sages of India did themselves, though he extolled the latter whenever he opened his mouth (।)

▪ that he would not allow any sort of influence either to the sun, or to the sky, or to the earth, but pretended ot move and juggle and rearrange these forces for whatever end he chose. (magic theurgic)

▪ Apollonius remarked: “We do not want to hear about a house for ourselves, for the climate here is such that anyone can live naked,”—an unkind reference this to them, as it implied that they went without clothes not to show their endurance, but because it was too to wear any (is endurance ever the point, greeks are always obsessed by endurance)

▪ I am not surprised indeed at their nor yet knowing what I want, and what I am come here for, though the Indians never asked me these questions. (।)

▪ Damis took Timasion apart and asked him the question in private: “About these naked sages (।)

▪ I have already come among them twice, and I never saw any such thing about them (।)

▪ worthy of a woman or of a vulgar person to backbite him as he has done (।)

▪ Nilus, who was the youngest of the naked philosophers, running up to him (।)

▪ “Where,” said Apollonius, “shall we hold our interview?”
“Here,” said Thespesion, pointing to the grove (।)

▪ Thespesion was the eldest of the sect (।)

▪ those who come to the Pythian festival are, they say, escorted with the sound of pipe and song and lyre, and are honored with shows of comedies and tragedies; and then last of all they are presented with an exhibition of games and races run by naked athletes (।)

▪ At the Olympic festival, however, these superfluities are omitted as inappropriate and unworthy of the place; and those who go to the festival are only provided with the show of naked athletes originally instituted by Heracles. (।)

▪ same contrast between the wisdom of the Indians and our own. For they, like those who invite others to the Pythian festival, appeal to the crowd with all sorts of charms and wizardry; but we, like the athletes of Olympia, go naked (there were digambaras in india, but was endurance their point?)

▪ we live by partaking of its natural fruits, which we would have it yield to us gladly and without being tortured against its will (।)

▪ we are not unable to work tricks if we like (।)

▪ Heigh! you tree yonder,” he cried, pointing to an elm tree, the third in the row from that under which they were talking, “just salute the wise Apollonius, will you?” (।)

▪ Apollo tells what he knows without any miraculous display (।)

▪ forget all your legendary tales that you have acquired among the Indians. (।)

▪ You have seen in picture-books the representation of Heracles by Prodicus (।)

▪ in it Heracles is represented as a youth, who has not yet chosen the life he will lead; and vice and virtue stand in each side of him plucking his garments and trying to draw him to themselves. Vice is adorned with gold and necklaces and with purple raiment, and her cheeks are painted and her hair delicately plaited and her eyes underlined with henna; and she also wears golden slippers, for she is pictured strutting about in these; but virtue in the picture resembles a woman worn out with toil, with a pinched look; and she has chosen for her adornment rough squalor, and she goes without shoes and in the plainest of raiment, and she would have appeared naked if she had not too much regard for her feminine decency (।)

▪ she will wheel in tripods, whenever you drink, and golden thrones (indian wheeled tripods?)

▪ that you must not find dear or sweet anything which you have not won by hard work (stoic egyptian)

▪ you must be on your guard against all dreams and visions which lift you off the earth. (metaphysical speculation or haughtiness)

▪ I discerned a certain sublimity in the discipline of Pythagoras, and how a certain secret wisdom enabled him to know, not only who he was himself, but also who he had been (।)

▪ one of them professed that she would shower upon me a swarm of pleasures without any toil on my part and another that she would give me rest after toil; and a third that she would mingle mirth and merriment in my toil (।)

▪ One of them, however, boasted that she would restrain me from such things, but she was bold and abusive and in an unabashed manner elbowed all others aside; and I beheld the ineffable form of wisdom which long ago conquered the soul of Pythagoras; and she stood, I may tell you, not among the many, but kept herself apart and in silence (।)

▪ she said: ‘Young man, I am unpleasing and a lady full of sorrows; for, if anyone betakes himself to my abode, he must of his own choice put away all dishes which contain the flesh of living animals, and he must forget wine, nor make muddy therewith the cup of wisdom which is set in the souls of those that drink no wine; (।)

▪ nor shall blanket keep him warm, nor wool shorn from a living animal.
But I allow him shoes of bark (।)

▪ soul, the well-springs of whose existence lie back in the immortal and in the unbegotten.
Now I agree that this doctrine was wholly alien to the Athenians; for when Plato in their city lifted up his voice and discoursed upon the soul, full of inspiration and wisdom, they caviled against him and adopted opinions of the soul opposed thereto and altogether false (।)

▪ If then you were enamored of the wisdom which the Indians discovered, would you call it not by the name which its natural parents bore, but by the name of its adoptive sires; and so confer upon the Egyptians a greater boon (।)

▪ they live in contact with a purer daylight, and entertain truer opinions of nature and of the gods, because they are near unto the latter, and live on the edge and confines of that thermal essence which quickens all unto life (।)

▪ talent of Aeschylus is said to have made upon the Athenians. For he was a poet of tragedy, and finding the art to be rude and inchoate and as yet not in the least elaborated, he went to work, and curtailed the prolixity of the chorus, and invented dialogues for the actors, discarding the long monodies of the earlier time; and he hit upon a plan of killing people behind the stage instead of their being slain before the eyes of the audience. (.)

▪ gratification of a philosophic system devised to meet the requirements of a Pythagoras, and also breathing the inspiration in which Pythagoras was anticipated by the Indians, lasts not for a brief time, but for an endless and incalculable period (.)

▪ there was a time when you yourselves took counsel with Pythagoras, and were advocates of this same wisdom; that was in the time when you could say nothing too good of the Indian philosophy, for to begin with and of old you were Indians. Subsequently because your soil was wrath with you, you came hither; and then ashamed of the reasons owing to which you quitted it, you tried to get men to regard you as anything rather than Ethiopians who had come from India hither, and you took every pains to efface your past.
This is why you stripped yourselves of the apparel in which you came thence, as if you were anxious to doff along with it your Ethiopian nationality. This is why you have resolved to worship the gods in the Egyptian rather than in your own fashion, and why you have set yourselves to disseminate unflattering stories of the Indians (.)

▪ You have also, Thespesion, made some remarks about the simplicity and freedom from pomp which characterizes the Pythian oracle; and by way of example you instanced the temple composed of wax and feathers; but I do not myself find that even this was devoid of pomp (।)

▪ the god I believe regarded even this as too humble and below the dignity of wisdom, and therefore desired to have another and yet another temple, big ones these and a hundred feet in breadth (।)

▪ from one of them it is said that golden figures of the wryneck were hung up which possessed in a manner the charm of the Sirens (।)

▪ god collected the most precious of the offerings into the Pythian temple for ornament (।)

▪ nor did he reject works of statuary, when their authors brought him to his temple colossal figures of gods and men, and also of horses, oxen and other animals; nor did he refuse the gift of [the worker of precious metal] Glaucus brought thither of a stand for a goblet, nor the picture of the taking of the citadel of Ilium which Polygnotus painted there. (।)

▪ he admitted it on behalf of the Hellenes themselves, by way of pointing out to them, I believe, the immense riches of the barbarians, and inducing them to covet that rather than continue to ravage one another’s lands (।)

▪ I suppose you will call it miracle-monging, that Apollo dictates his oracles with such proud dignity and elation of spirit? (।)

▪ there are certain old women who go about with sieves in their hands to shepherds, sometimes to cow-herds, pretending to heal their flocks, when they are sick, by divination, as they call it, and they claim to be called wise women, yea wiser than those who are unfeignedly prophets. (।)

▪ Indians; for they are divine, and have trimmed and adorned their science after the matter of the Pythian oracle (।)

▪ tripods, gifted with will of their own, attend the banquets of the gods also; and Ares, ignorant and hostile as he was to Hephaestus, yet never accused him merely for making them (।)

▪ subterranean gods will always prefer deep trenches and ceremonies conducted in the hollows of the earth, but the air is the chariot of the sun; (nāga worship?)

▪ Egyptians were so impressed by Apollonius’ words, that Thespesion, in spite of the blackness of his complexion, visibly blushed (।)

▪ youngest of them, whose name was Nilus, leapt up from the ground, he says, in admiration, and passing over to Apollonius shook hands with him, and besought him to tell him about the interviews which he had had with the Indians (।)

▪ Apollonius, he says, replied: “I should not grudge you anything, for you are ready to listen, as I see, and are ready to welcome wisdom of every kind; but I should not care to pour out the teachings I gathered there upon Thespesion or on anyone else who regards the lore of the Indians as so much nonsense.” (।)

▪ Thespesion said: “But if you were a merchant or a seafarer, and you brought to us some cargo or other from over there, would you claim, merely because it came from India, to dispose of it untested and unexamined, refusing us either the liberty of looking at it or tasting it?” (।)

▪ Thespesion, however, was anxious to put a stop to such propositions, so he said: “I am glad, Apollonius, that you are annoyed at what we said to you; for you can the more readily condone our annoyance at the misrepresentation you made of our local wisdom, long before you had gained any experience of its quality.” (।)

▪ Apollonius was for a moment astonished at these words, for he had heard nothing as yet of the intrigues of Thrasybulus and Euphrates; but as was his wont, he guessed the truth and said: “The Indians, O Thespesion, would never have behaved as you have, nor have given ear to these insinuation dropped by Euphrates, for they have a gift of prescience (।)

▪ victims of calumny incur considerable dangers, since they are, I suppose, sure to be disliked without having done any wrong, yet neither are those who incline to listen to the calumnies free from danger (।)

▪ Thespesion tried to calm him, and remarked: “Enough of Euphrates and of his small-minded affairs (।)

▪ said Apollonius, “who shall reconcile me with you? For the victim of lies must surely be driven into hostility by the falsehood.” (।)

▪ midday, they broke of the conversations, for at this time of day the naked sages, like others, attend to the ceremonies of religion. (।)

▪ My father once made a voyage on his own initiative to the Red Sea, for he was, I may tell you, captain of the ship which the Egyptians send to the Indies. And after he had had intercourse with the Indians of the seaboard, he brought home stories of the wise men of that region, closely similar to those which you have told us (egyptian boats in india. linus | mani's adoptive father's story of berenice)

▪ account which I heard was somewhat as follows, namely that the Indians are the wisest of mankind, but that the Ethiopians are colonists sent from India, who follow their forefathers in matters of wisdom (।)

▪ I shall not cease to go about and repeat your teachings to the Greeks, while to the Indians I shall write them.” (writings from egypt greece to india)

▪ what induced you to impart, as your tradition, to the people of this country forms of the gods that are absurd and grotesque in all but a few cases? (।)

▪ “Your artists, then, like Phidias,” said the other, “and like Praxiteles,[1] went up, I suppose, to heaven and took a copy of the forms of the gods, and then reproduced these by their art or was there any other influence which presided over and guided their molding?” (।)

▪ imitation is often baffled by terror (lol)

▪ entertain a notion of Zeus you must, I suppose, envisage him along with heaven and seasons and stars, as Phidias in his day endeavoured to do, and if you would fashion an image of Athena you must imagine in your mind armies and cunning, and handicrafts, and how she leapt out of Zeus himself (।)

▪ Is it not likely that perjurers and temple-thieves and all the rabble of low jesters will despise such holy objects rather than dread them (basing honor of god on indesacrability)

▪ gods in Egypt would have met with much greater reverence, if no images of them had ever been set up at all, and if you had planned your theology along other lines wiser and more mysterious (।)

▪ you have denied to the gods the privilege of beauty both of the outer eye and of an inner suggestion.” (।)

▪ Thespesion replied and said: “There was was a certain Athenian, called Socrates, a foolish old man like ourselves, who thought that the dog and the goose and the plane tree were gods and used to swear by them.” (।)

▪ said Apollonius, “but a divine and unfeignedly wise man; for he did not swear by these objects on the understanding that they were gods, but to save himself from swearing by the gods.” (।)

▪ Thespesion as if anxious to drop the subject, put some questions to Apollonius, about the scourging in Sparta, and asked if the Lacedaemonians were smitten with rods in public. (।)

▪ custom of scourging is a ceremony in honor of the Scythian Artemis, so they say, and was prescribed by oracles (।)

▪ to oppose the regulations of the gods is in my opinion utter madness (।)

▪ “It’s not the scourging,” he said, “but the sprinkling of the altar with human blood that is important, for the Scythians too held the altar to be worthy thereof; but the Lacedaemonians modified the ceremony of sacrifice because of its implacable cruelty, and turned it into a contest of endurance, undergone without any loss of life, and yet securing to the goddess as first fruits an offering of their own blood.” (।)

▪ “Why then,” said the other, “do they not sacrifice strangers right out to Artemis, as the Scythians formerly considered right to do?” (।)

▪ it is not congenial to any of the Greeks to adopt in full rigor the manners and customs of barbarians. (।)

▪ “O Thespesion, the law-giver Lycurgus; but we must understand him, and then we shall see that his prohibition to strangers to settle in Sparta and live there was not inspired on his part by mere boorish exclusiveness, but by a desire to keep the institutions of Sparta in their original purity by preventing outsiders from mingling in her life.” (।)

▪ although they enforced his policy of excluding strangers, corrupted their institutions, and were found doing exactly the same as did those of the Greeks whom they most detested. (।)

▪ their subsequent naval program [during the Ionian War] and policy of imposing tribute was modelled entirely upon that of Athens, and they themselves ended by committing acts which they had themselves regarded as a just casus belli against the Athenians, whom they had no sooner beaten in the field than they humbly adopted (।)

▪ the very fact that the goddess was introduced from Taurus and Scythia was the action of men who embraced alien customs (।)

▪ law which prevails among the Scythians, and sentences all men of sixty years of age to death (।)

▪ ancient institutions, whose hoary age defies our understanding of their origins, are to be examined in an unsympathetic spirit, and the reason why they are pleasing to heaven subjected to cold criticism (।)

▪ we could attack the mystery rite of Eleusis in the same way and ask, why it is this and not that; and the same with the rites of the Samothracians, for in their ritual they avoid one thing and insist on another; and the same with the Dionysiac ceremonies and the phallic symbol, and the figure erected in Cyllene (।)

▪ first reference in ancient literature to phantasia as an important aspect of the creative process (।)

▪ no one reserves his praise for a man who has simply shown himself to be not bad. For because a thing, no matter what, is equidistant between praise and punishment, it is not on that account to be reckoned off-hand to be virtue” (virtue is worse better than being not bad)

▪ he shall be crowned, because he has come back again without enriching himself or amassing any fortune, but the poorest of the Athenians, poorer than he was before (।)

▪ Whereas Aristides has fixed the tribute of the allies according to their ability to pay, and not in excess of the resources of their respective countries; and whereas he has endeavored to keep them loyal to the Athenians, and to see that they shall feel it no grievance to pay upon this scale, it is hereby resolved to crown him for justice (।)

▪ rightly judged, it is not the man who abstains from injustice that is just, but the man who himself does what is just, and also influences others not to be unjust (।)

▪ Nilus returned, but did not tell them anything of what they had said to him, though he laughed a good deal to himself. And no one asked him what he was laughing about, but they respected his secret. (।)

▪ lions close to the path, and leopards and other such wild animals; but they were not attracted by any of them, for they fled from them in haste as if they were scared at the sight of men. (।)

▪ nomad Ethiopians live in a sort of colony upon wagons, and not far from them the elephant-hunters, who cut up these animals and sell the flesh (।)

▪ Nasamones and the man-eaters and the pigmies and the shadow- footed people are also tribes of Ethiopia, and they extend as far as the Ethiopian ocean (।)

▪ further road which leads up to the first springs of the river was impracticable, they tell us, and impossible to think of; for they tell many stories of the demons which haunt it, stories similar to those which Pindar in his wisdom puts into verse about the demon whom he sets over these springs to preserve the due proportions of the Nile. (।)

▪ for ten months the ghost of a satyr had been haunting the village, who was mad after the women and was said to have killed two of them to whom he was supposed to be specially attached (।)

▪ said Apollonius, “I have a remedy against these hell-hounds, which Midas is said once to have employed (।)

▪ Midas himself had some of the blood of satyrs in his veins, as was clear from the shape of his ears; and a satyr once, trespassing on his kinship with Midas, made merry at the expense of his ears, not only singing about them, but piping about them (।)

▪ Midas, I understand, had heard from his mother that when a satyr is overcome by wine he falls asleep, and at such times comes to his senses and will make friends with you (।)

▪ he mixed wine which he had in his palace in a fountain and let the satyr get at it (talmud solomon asmodeus)

▪ he poured four Egyptian jars of wine into the trough out of which the village cattle drank, and then called the satyr by means of some secret rebuke or threat; and though as yet the latter was not visible, the wine sensibly diminished as if it was being drunk up (।)

▪ cave of the nymphs, which was not quite a furlong away from the village; and he showed them a satyr lying fast asleep in it (।)

▪ youth of my own age in Lemnos whose mother was said to be visited by a satyr, as he well might to judge by this story; for he was represented as wearing in his back a fawn-skin that exactly fitted him, the front paws of which were drawn around his neck and fastened over his chest (।)

▪ original story (Aristotle, Eudemus, fr.6 [Ross]), is not about the capture of a satyr, but of Silenus (।)

▪ died through eating the fish called the sea-hare (।)

▪ this fish, according to Damis, causes secret humors in the body worse and more fatal than anything else either in the sea or on land. (।)

▪ Nero, he says, introduced this sea-hare in his dishes to poison his worst enemies; and so did Domitian in order to remove his brother Titus (।)

▪ “Apollonius, the philosopher, sends greeting to Demetrius the cynic.
“I have made a present of you to the Emperor Titus, that you may instruct him how to behave as a sovereign, (।)

▪ inhabitants of Tarsus had previously detested Apollonius, because of the violent reproaches which he addressed to them, owing to the fact that through their languid indifference and sensual indolence they could not put up with the vigor of his remarks (।)

▪ his nightingales and his blackbirds, and how he trained the tongues of stone curlews (।)

▪ Apollonius said: “I think you are spoiling the accents of the birds, in the first place because you don’t let them utter their own notes, which are so sweet that not even the best musical instruments could rival or imitate them, and in the second place because you yourself talk the vilest Greek dialects and are only teaching them to stutter like yourself (।)

▪ help you to shake off the parasites that cling to you and oppress you; nay you are forced to shower your wealth upon them and cast your gold before them, and you scatter tidbits before dogs; and to stop their barking you must give again and again, until at last you will find yourself reduced to hunger and to poverty. (।)

▪ that you have been plucked of your wealth as if it were plumage (।)

▪ that you are a fitter subject to excite the birds to lament than to sing (।)

▪ there is in all cities a class of men, whose acquaintance you have never made, but who are called schoolmasters. You give them a little of your substance with the certainty of getting it back with interest; for they will teach you the rhetoric of the Forum (।)

▪ if you thoroughly learn this branch, you will at any rate be equipped like a light-armed soldier or a slinger, for you will be able to fling words at your sycophants, as you would stones at dogs.” (।)

▪ Two stories are told in Sardes, one that the River Pactolus used to bring down gold dust to Croesus, and the other that trees are older than earth (।)

▪ when my daughters have had their dowries assigned to them, my capital, which is now only 20,000 drachmas, will have vanished; and they will think that they have got all too little, while I shall perish because I shall have nothing at all.” (।)

▪ man who was in love with a nude statue of Aphrodite which is erected in Cnidus; and he was making offerings to it, and said that he would make yet others with a view to marrying the statue (।)

▪ the islanders were not averse of the idea, but said that the fame of the goddess would be greatly enhanced if she had a lover (।)

▪ Apollonius replied: “The poets have turned your poor head by their talk of unions of Anchises and Peleus (।)

▪ cities on the left side of the Hellespont were visited by earthquakes, and Egyptians and Chaldaeans went begging about through them to collect money, pretending that they wanted ten talents with which to offer sacrifices to earth and to Poseidon.[1] And the cities began to contribute under the stress of fear, partly out of their common funds and partly out of private. But the imposters refused to offer the sacrifices in behalf of their dupes unless the money was deposited in the banks. (।)

▪ emperor Domitian about the same time passed a law against making men eunuchs (।)

▪ draught of water cures a mad dog, if he has only the courage to take it. (।)

▪ Senate had all its most distinguished members cut off, philosophy was reduced to cowering in a corner, to such an extent that some of its votaries disguised themselves by changing their dress and ran away to take refuge among the western Celts, while others fled to the deserts of Libya and Scythia, and others again stooped to compose orations in which his crimes were palliated. (।)

▪ the Scythians who go about upon wagons; they are just as much in chains as ourselves; for rivers like the Ister [Danube] and the Thermodon and the Tanais hem them in, and they are very difficult to cross, except when they are hard frozen; and they fix up their houses on their wagons (।)

▪ cavern in Lebadea is dedicated to Trophonius, the son of Apollo, and it can only be entered by those who resort thither in order to get an oracle, and it is not visible in the temple, but lies a little above it on a mound; and it is shut in by iron spits which surround it, and you descend into it as it were sitting down and being drawn down. Those who enter it are clad in white raiment, and are escorted thither with honey-cakes in their hands to appease the reptiles which assail them as they descend. But the earth brings them to the surface again, in some cases close by, but in other cases a long way off; for they are sent up to the surface beyond Locri and beyond Phocis, but most of them about the borders of Boeotia. (।)

▪ priests opposed him and though they told the multitude that they would never allow a wizard like him to examine and test the shrine, they pretended to the sage himself that there were forbidden days and days unclean for consulting (।)

▪ he delivered a discourse at the springs of Hercyne, about the origin and conduct of the shrine; for it is the only oracle which gives responses through the person himself who consults it (।)

▪ when the evening approached, he went to the mouth of the cave with his train of youthful followers, and having pulled up four of the obelisks [i.e. the spits], which constitute a bar to the passage (।)

▪ he went down below ground wearing his philosopher’s mantle, having dressed himself as if he were going to deliver an address upon philosophy—a step which the god Trophonius so thoroughly approved of, that he appeared to the priests and not only rebuked them for the reception they had given Apollonius, but enjoined them all to follow him to Aulis, for he said it was there that he [Apollonius] would come to surface in such a marvelous fashion as no man before. (।)

▪ he emerged after seven days, a longer period than it had taken anyone of those who until then had entered the oracle, and he had with him a volume thoroughly in keeping with the questions he had asked: for had gone down saying: “What, O Trophonius, do you consider the most complete and purest philosophy?” And the volume contained the tenets of Pythagoras, a good proof this, that the oracle was in agreement with this form of wisdom. (।)

▪ This book is preserved in Antium, and the village in question, which is on the Italian seaboard, is much visited for the purpose of seeing it (।)

▪ it was subsequently conveyed to the Emperor Hadrian at the same time as certain letters of Apollonius (।)

▪ came to Tyana a youth who did not shrink from acrimonious discussions, and would not accept truth in argument. (।)

▪ young man in question, however, would on no account allow the tenet of immortality of the soul, and said: “I myself, gentlemen, have done nothing now for over nine months but pray to Apollonius that he would reveal to me the truth about the soul; but he is so utterly dead (।)

▪ he leapt up still in a half sleep, streaming with perspiration, and cried out: “I believe thee.”
And, when those who were present asked him what was the matter; “Do you not see,” said he, “Apollonius the sage (।)

▪ ‘The soul is immortal, and ‘tis no possession of thine own, but of Providence, And after the body is wasted away, like a swift horse freed from its traces, It lightly leaps forward and mingles itself with the light air, loathing the spell of harsh and painful servitude which it has endured. But for thee, what use is there in this? Some day, when thou art no more, thou shalt believe it. So why, as long as thou art among living beings, dost thou explore these mysteries?’” (।)
