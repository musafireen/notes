Νόμος οὖν καὶ ὑπόληψις κενὴ τὰ μυστήρια 14 καὶ τοῦ δράκοντος ἀπάτη τίς ἐστιν θρῃσκευομένη, τὰς ἀμυήτους ὄντως μυήσεις καὶ τὰς ἀνοργιάστους τελετὰς εὐσεβείᾳ νόθῳ προστρεπομένων. 

The mysteries, then, are mere custom and pointless opinion, and it is a deceit of the serpent that men worship when, with spurious piety, they turn toward these sacred initiations that are really profanities and solemn rites that are without sanctity.

οἷαι δὲ καὶ αἱ κίσται αἱ μυστικαί: δεῖ γὰρ ἀπογυμνῶσαι τὰ ἅγια αὐτῶν καὶ τὰ ἄρρητα ἐξειπεῖν. οὐ σησαμαῖ ταῦτα καὶ πυραμίδες καὶ τολύπαι καὶ πόπανα πολυόμφαλα χόνδροι τε ἁλῶν καὶ δράκων, ὄργιον Διονύσου Βασσάρου; οὐχὶ δὲ ῥοιαὶ πρὸς τοῖσδε καὶ κράδαι 15 νάρθηκές τε καὶ κιττοί, πρὸς δὲ καὶ φθοῖς καὶ μήκωνες; ταῦτ̓ ἔστιν αὐτῶν τὰ ἅγια. καὶ προσέτι Γῆς 16 Θέμιδος τὰ ἀπόρρητα σύμβολα ὀρίγανον, λύχνος, ξίφος, κτεὶς γυναικεῖος, ὅς ἐστιν, εὐφήμως καὶ μυστικῶς εἰπεῖν, μόριον γυναικεῖον. ὢ τῆς ἐμφανοῦς ἀναισχυντίας. 

Consider, too, the contents of the mystic chests, because I must strip bare their holy things and utter the unspeakable. Are they not sesame cakes, pyramid and spherical cakes, cakes with many navels, also balls of salt and a serpent, the mystic sign of Dionysos Bassareus? Are they not also pomegranates, fig branches, fennel stalks, ivy leaves, round cakes and poppies? These are their holy things? In addition, there are the unutterable symbols of Ge Themis, a lamp, a sword, and a woman’s comb, which is a euphemistic expression used for a woman’s secret parts. What manifest shamelessness!

πάλαι μὲν ἀνθρώποις σωφρονοῦσιν ἐπικάλυμμα ἡδονῆς νὺξ ἦν σιωπωμένη: νυνὶ δὲ τοῖς μυουμένοις πεῖρα 17 τῆς ἀκρασίας νύξ ἐστι λαλουμένη, καὶ τὸ πῦρ ἐλέγχει τὰ πάθη δᾳδουχούμενον. ἀπόσβεσον, ὦ ἱεροφάντα, τὸ πῦρ: [p. 46] αἰδέσθητι, δᾳδοῦχε, τὰς λαμπάδας: ἐλέγχει σου τὸν Ἴακχον τὸ φῶς: ἐπίτρεψον ἀποκρύψαι τῇ νυκτὶ τὰ μυστήρια: σκότει τετιμήσθω τὰ ὄργια. τὸ πῦρ οὐχ ὑποκρίνεται: ἐλέγχειν καὶ κολάζειν κελεύεται. 

Formerly night, which drew a veil over the pleasures of temperate men, was a time for silence. But now, when night is for those who are being initiated a temptation to sexual license, talk abounds, and the torch-fires convict unbridled passions. Quench the fire, you priest! Shrink from the flaming brands, torchbearer! The light convicts your Iacchos. Experience night to hide the mysteries. Let the rites (orgia) be honoured by darkness. The fire is not acting a part; to convict and to punish is fire’s [God’s fire’s] duty.

Ταῦτα τῶν ἀθέων τὰ μυστήρια: ἀθέους δὲ εἰκότως ἀποκαλῶ τούτους, οἳ τὸν μὲν ὄντως ὄντα θεὸν ἠγνοήκασιν, παιδίον δὲ ὑπὸ Τιτάνων διασπώμενον καὶ γύναιον πενθοῦν καὶ μόρια ἄρρητα ὡς ἀληθῶς ὑπ̓ αἰσχύνης ἀναισχύντως σέβουσιν, διττῇ ἐνεσχημένοι τῇ ἀθεότητι, 

These are the mysteries of the atheists. And I am right in branding as atheists men who are ignorant of the true God, but shamelessly worship a child [i.e. Dionysos as a child] being torn to pieces by Titans, a poor grief-stricken woman, and parts of the body which, from a sense of shame, are truly too sacred to speak of. It is a twofold atheism in which they are entangled. 

### s20
προτέρᾳ μέν, καθ̓ ἣν ἀγνοοῦσι τὸν θεόν, τὸν ὄντως ὄντα μὴ γνωρίζοντες θεόν, ἑτέρᾳ δὲ καὶ δευτέρᾳ δὴ ταύτῃ τῇ πλάνῃ τοὺς οὐκ ὄντας ὡς ὄντας νομίζοντες καὶ θεοὺς τούτους ὀνομάζοντες τοὺς οὐκ ὄντως ὄντας, μᾶλλον δὲ οὐδὲ ὄντας, μόνου δὲ τοῦ ὀνόματος τετυχηκότας. διὰ τοῦτό τοι καὶ ὁ ἀπόστολος διελέγχει ἡμᾶς ‘καὶ ἦτε ξένοι’ λέγων ‘τῶν διαθηκῶν τῆς ἐπαγγελίας, ἐλπίδα μὴ ἔχοντες καὶ ἄθεοι ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ.’ 

(20) First, there is the atheism of being ignorant of God, since they do not recognize the true God.  Then there is the second error of believing in the existence of beings that have no existence, and calling by the name of gods those who are not really gods – no, in fact, who do not even exist, but only have the name. No doubt this is also the reason why the apostle convicts us, when he says, “And you were strangers from the covenants of the promise, being without hope and atheists in the world” [Pseudo-Paul, Letter to the Ephesians 2:12].

Πολλὰ κἀγαθὰ γένοιτο τῷ τῶν Σκυθῶν βασιλεῖ, ὅστις ποτὲ ἦν Ἀνάχαρσις. 18 οὗτος τὸν πολίτην τὸν ἑαυτοῦ, τὴν παρὰ Κυζικηνοῖς μητρὸς τῶν θεῶν τελετὴν ἀπομιμούμενον παρὰ Σκύθαις τύμπανόν τε [p. 48] ἐπικτυποῦντα καὶ κύμβαλον ἐπηχοῦντα καὶ τοῦ τραχήλου τινὰ μηναγύρτην ἐξηρτημένον, κατετόξευσεν, ὡς ἄνανδρον αὐτόν τε παῤ Ἕλλησι γεγενημένον καὶ τῆς θηλείας τοῖς ἄλλοις Σκυθῶν διδάσκαλον νόσου. 

[Example of Anacharsis the Scythian, drawn from Herodotos]

May the Scythian king, whoever he was, have all good things. When a countryman of his own [i.e. Anacharsis] was imitating among the Scythians the rite of the Mother of the Gods as practiced at Kyzikos (or: Cyzicus), by beating a drum and clanging a cymbal, and by having images of the goddess suspended from his neck like a begger for the Mother goddess (mēnagyrtēs), this king killed him with an arrow [Herodotus, Inquiries 4.76 – link]. The king did so on the ground that the man, having been deprived of his own virility in Greece, was now communicating the effeminate disease to his fellow Scythians.

[p. 50] Ἀκρότητες ἄρα ἀμαθίας ἀθεότης καὶ δεισιδαιμονία, ὦν ἐκτὸς μένειν σπουδαστέον. 

(21) I must not at all conceal what I think: All this makes me amazed how the label “atheist” has been applied to Euhemeros of Akragas, Nikanor of Cyprus, Diagoras and Hippo of Melos, with that Cyrenian named Theodoros and a good many others besides, men who lived sensible lives and discerned more acutely, I imagine, than the rest of humankind the error connected with these gods. Even if they did not perceive the truth itself, they at least suspected the error. This suspicion of error is a living spark of wisdom, and no small one, which grows up like a seed into truth. One of them [Xenophanes] directs the Egyptians in this way: “If you believe they are gods, do not lament them, nor beat the breast; but if you mourn for them, no longer consider these beings to be gods.” Another, having taken hold of a Herakles made from a log of wood – he happened, likely enough, to be cooking something at home – said: “Come, Herakles, now is your time to undertake this thirteenth labour for me, as you did the twelve for Eurystheus, and prepare Diagoras his dish!” Then he put him into the fire like a log. It appears then that atheism and fear of the lower spirits (deisidaimonia) are the extreme points of stupidity, from which we must earnestly endeavour to keep ourselves apart. . . . [omitted remainder of section which shifts to the causes of the Greek worship of images or idolatry].

### s33
καὶ πόσῳ βελτίους Αἰγύπτιοι κωμηδὸν καὶ κατὰ πόλεις τὰ ἄλογα τῶν ζῴων ἐκτετιμηκότες ἤπερ Ἕλληνες τοιούτους προσκυνοῦντες θεούς; τὰ μὲν γὰρ εἰ καὶ θηρία, ἀλλ̓ οὐ μοιχικά, ἀλλ̓ οὐ μάχλα, παρὸ φύσιν δὲ θηρεύει ἡδονὴν οὐδὲ ἕν. οἱ δὲ ὁποῖοι. [p. 84] τί καὶ χρὴ λέγειν ἔτι, ἀποχρώντως αὐτῶν διεληλεγμένων; 

How much better are Egyptians, when in cities and villages they hold in great honour irrational animals, than Greeks who worship gods such as these? For though the Egyptian gods are beasts, still they are not adulterous, they are not lewd, and not one of them seeks for pleasure contrary to its own nature. But as for the characteristics of the Greek gods, what need is there to say more? They have been sufficiently exposed [i.e. in the previous section about Greek myths about deities].

Ἀλλ̓ οὖν γε Αἰγύπτιοι, ὧν νῦν δὴ ἐμνήσθην, κατὰ τὰς θρῃσκείας τὰς σφῶν ἐσκέδανται: σέβουσι δὲ αὐτῶν Συηνῖται 63 φάγρον τὸν ἰχθύν, μαιώτην δὲ ῾ἄλλος 64 οὗτος ἰχθύς᾿ οἱ τὴν Ἐλεφαντίνην οἰκοῦντες, Ὀξυρυγχῖται τὸν φερώνυμον τῆς χώρας αὐτῶν ὁμοίως ἰχθύν, ἔτι γε μὴν Ἡρακλεοπολῖται ἰχνεύμονα, Σαῗται δὲ καὶ Θηβαῖοι πρόβατον, Λυκοπολῖται δὲ λύκον, Κυνοπολασῖται δὲ κύνα, τὸν Ἆπιν Μεμφῖται, Μενδήσιοι τὸν τράγον. 

(34) However, the Egyptians that I mentioned just now are divided on the issue of worship (thrēskeia). The people of Syene revere the fish phagros. The inhabitants of Elephantine revere another fish, the maiotes. The people of Oxyrhynchos also revere a fish, that which bears the name of their land. Further, the people of Herakleopolis revere the ichneumon; those of of Sais and Thebes, the sheep; those of Lykopolis, the wolf; those of Kynopolis, the dog; those of Memphis, the bull Apis; and, those of Mendes, the goat.

ὑμεῖς δὲ οι（ πάντ̓ ἀμείνους Αἰγυπτίων ῾ὀκνῶ δὲ εἰπεῖν χείρους᾿, οἳ τοὺς Αἰγυπτίους ὁσημέραι γελῶντες οὐ παύεσθε, 65 ποῖοί 66 τινες καὶ περὶ τὰ ἄλογα ζῷα; Θεσσαλοὶ μὲν ὑμῶν τοὺς πελαργοὺς τετιμήκασι διὰ τὴν συνήθειαν, Θηβαῖοι δὲ τὰς γαλᾶς διὰ τὴν Ἡρακλέους γένεσιν. 

[Greeks engaging in animal worship, with citation of works on Greek customs]
But as for you [Greeks], who are in every way better than Egyptians – I pull back from calling you worse – you never let a day pass without laughing at the Egyptians, but what is your attitude with regard to the irrational animals? The Thessalians among you honour storks based on an old custom, and Thebans honour weasels on account of the birth of Herakles.

τί δὲ πάλιν Θετταλοί; μύρμηκας ἱστοροῦνται σέβειν, ἐπεὶ τὸν Δία μεμαθήκασιν ὁμοιωθέντα μύρμηκι τῇ Κλήτορος θυγατρὶ Εὐρυμεδούσῃ μιγῆναι καὶ Μυρμιδόνα γεννῆσαι: Πολέμων δὲ τοὺς ἀμφὶ τὴν Τρωάδα κατοικοῦντας ἱστορεῖ τοὺς ἐπιχωρίους μῦς σέβειν, 67 οὓς σμίνθους καλοῦσιν, ὅτι τὰς νευρὰς [p. 86] τῶν πολεμίων διέτρωγον τῶν τόξων: καὶ Σμίνθιον Ἀπόλλωνα ἀπὸ τῶν μυῶν ἐκείνων ἐπεφήμισαν. 

What else about Thessalians? They are reported to worship ants, because they have been taught that Zeus, in the likeness of an ant, had intercourse with Eurymedusa the daughter of Kletor and gave birth to Myrmidon. Polemon relates that the inhabitants of the Troad worship the local mice (which they call sminthoi), because these used to gnaw through their enemies’ bowstrings, and they named Apollo “Smintheus” after these mice.

Ἡρακλείδης δὲ ἐν Κτίσεσιν ἱερῶν περὶ τὴν Ἀκαρνανίαν φησίν, ἔνθα τὸ Ἄκτιόν ἐστιν ἀκρωτήριον καὶ τοῦ Ἀπόλλωνος τοῦ Ἀκτίου τὸ ἱερόν, ταῖς μυίαις προθύεσθαι βοῦν. οὐδὲ μὴν Σαμίων ἐκλήσομαι ῾πρόβατον, ὥς φησιν Εὐφορίων, σέβουσι Σάμιοἰ οὐδέ γε τῶν τὴν Φοινίκην Σύρων κατοικούντων, ὧν οἱ μὲν τὰς περιστεράς, οἱ δὲ τοὺς ἰχθῦς οὕτω σέβουσι περιττῶς ὡς Ἠλεῖοι τὸν Δία. 

Herakleides, in his work on The Founding of Temples in Akarnania, says that on the promontory of Actium, where the temple of Apollo of Actium is located, a preliminary sacrifice of an ox is made to the flies. Nor will I forget the Samians, who, as Euphorion says, revere the sheep. (35) No, nor will I forget the Syrian inhabitants of Phoenicia, some of whom revere doves and others revere fish [cf. Lucian at this link], as extravagantly as the Eleans worship Zeus.

Εἶεν δή: ἐπειδὴ οὐ θεοί, οὓς θρῃσκεύετε, αὖθις ἐπισκέψασθαί μοι δοκεῖ εἰ ὄντως εἶεν δαίμονες, δευτέρᾳ ταύτῃ, ὡς ὑμεῖς φατέ, ἐγκαταλεγόμενοι τάξει. 

So then, since the ones you whom you worship are not gods, I am resolved to make a fresh examination to see whether it is true that they are lower spirits (daimones) and should be enrolled, as you say, in this second rank 

εἰ γὰρ οὖν δαίμονες, λίχνοι τε καὶ μιαροί. ἔστι μὲν ἐφευρεῖν καὶ ἀναφανδὸν οὕτω κατὰ πόλεις δαίμονας ἐπιχωρίους τιμὴν ἐπιδρεπομένους, παρὰ Κυθνίοις Μενέδημον, παρὰ Τηνίοις Καλλισταγόραν, παρὰ Δηλίοις Ἄνιον, παρὰ Λάκωσιν Ἀστράβακον. τιμᾶται δέ τις καὶ Φαληροῖ κατὰ πρύμναν ἥρως: καὶ ἡ Πυθία συνέταξε θύειν Πλαταιεῦσιν Ἀνδροκράτει καὶ Δημοκράτει καὶ Κυκλαίῳ καὶ Λεύκωνι τῶν Μηδικῶν ἀκμαζόντων ἀγώνων. ἔστι καὶ [p. 88] ἄλλους παμπόλλους συνιδεῖν δαίμονας τῷ γε καὶ σμικρὸν διαθρεῖν δυναμένῳ: τρὶς γὰρ μύριοί εἰσιν ἐπὶ χθονὶ πουλυβοτείρῃ δαίμονες ἀθάνατοι, φύλακες μερόπων ἀνθρώπων. τίνες εἰσὶν οἱ φύλακες, ὦ Βοιώτιε, μὴ φθονέσῃς λέγειν. ἢ δῆλον ὡς οὗτοι καὶ οἱ τούτων ἐπιτιμότεροι, οἱ μεγάλοι δαίμονες, ὁ Ἀπόλλων, ἡ Ἄρτεμις, ἡ Λητώ, ἡ Δημήτηρ, ἡ Κόρη, ὁ Πλούτων, ὁ Ἡρακλῆς, αὐτὸς ὁ Ζεύς. ἀλλ̓ οὐκ ἀποδρᾶναι ἡμᾶς φυλάττουσιν, Ἀσκραῖε, μὴ ἁμαρτάνειν δὲ ἴσως, οἱ ἁμαρτιῶν δῆτα οὐ πεπειραμένοι. ἐνταῦθα δὴ τὸ παροιμιῶδες ἐπιφθέγξασθαι ἁρμόττει ‘πατὴρ ἀνουθέτητα 68 παῖδα νουθετεῖ.’ εἰ δ̓ ἄρα καὶ εἰσὶ φύλακες οὗτοι, οὐκ εὐνοίᾳ τῇ πρὸς ἡμᾶς περιπαθεῖς, τῆς δὲ ὑμεδαπῆς ἀπωλείας ἐχόμενοι, κολάκων δίκην, ἐγχρίμπτονται τῷ βίῳ, δελεαζόμενοι καπνῷ. αὐτοί που ἐξομολογοῦνται οἱ δαίμονες τὴν γαστριμαργίαν τὴν αὑτῶν, λοιβῆς τε κνίσης τε: τὸ γὰρ λάχομεν γέρας ἡμεῖς, λέγοντες. 

[i.e. compared to higher gods]. . . [omitted extensive discussion of whether the so-called gods are really lower spirits].

τίνα δ̓ ἂν φωνὴν ἄλλην, εἰ φωνὴν λάβοιεν Αἰγυπτίων θεοί, οἷα αἴλουροι καὶ γαλαῖ, προήσονται ἢ τὴν Ὁμηρικήν τε καὶ ποιητικήν, τῆς κνίσης τε καὶ ὀψαρτυτικῆς φίλην; τοιοίδε μέντοι παῤ ὑμῖν οἵ τε δαίμονες καὶ οἱ θεοὶ καὶ εἴ τινες [p. 90] ἡμίθεοι ὥσπερ ἡμίονοι κέκληνται: οὐδὲ γὰρ οὐδὲ ὀνομάτων ὑμῖν πενία πρὸς τὰς τῆς ἀσεβείας συνθέσεις.

. . . (36) If Egyptian gods, such as cats and weasels, were to be endowed with speech, what other cry are they likely to give forth than this from Homer’s poems, proclaiming a love for savoury odours and cookery? Be that as it may, such is the character of the lower spirits (daimones) and gods you worship, and of the semi-gods (hēmitheoi) too, if you have any called by this name, on the analogy of mules, or semi-asses. For you have no poverty – not even of words to form into the compounds needed for your impiety.

Φέρε δὴ οὖν καὶ τοῦτο προσθῶμεν, ὡς ἀπάνθρωποι καὶ μισάνθρωποι δαίμονες εἶεν ὑμῶν οἱ θεοὶ καὶ οὐχὶ μόνον ἐπιχαίροντες τῇ φρενοβλαβείᾳ τῶν ἀνθρώπων, πρὸς δὲ καὶ ἀνθρωποκτονίας ἀπολαύοντες: νυνὶ μὲν τὰς ἐν σταδίοις ἐνόπλους φιλονεικίας, νυνὶ δὲ τὰς ἐν πολέμοις ἀναρίθμους φιλοτιμίας ἀφορμὰς σφίσιν ἡδονῆς ποριζόμενοι, ὅπως ὅτι μάλιστα ἔχοιεν ἀνθρωπείων ἀνέδην ἐμφορεῖσθαι φόνων: ἤδη δὲ κατὰ πόλεις καὶ ἔθνη, οἱονεὶ λοιμοὶ ἐπισκήψαντες, σπονδὰς ἀπῄτησαν ἀνημέρους. 

Come then, let us add this: that your gods are inhuman and man-hating lower spirits (daimones) who not only celebrate at the insanity of men, but go so far as to enjoy human slaughter. They provide for themselves sources of pleasure, at one time in the armed contests of the stadium, at another in the innumerable rivalries of war, in order to secure every possible opportunity of glutting themselves to the full with human blood. Before now, too, they have fallen like plagues on whole cities and peoples (ethnē), and have demanded drink-offerings of a savage character.

Ἀριστομένης γοῦν ὁ Μεσσήνιος τῷ Ἰθωμήτῃ Διὶ τριακοσίους ἀπέσφαξεν, τοσαύτας ὁμοῦ καὶ τοιαύτας καλλιερεῖν οἰόμενος ἑκατόμβας: ἐν οἷς καὶ Θεόπομπος ἦν ὁ 1 Λακεδαιμονίων βασιλεύς, ἱερεῖον εὐγενές. Ταῦροι δὲ τὸ ἔθνος, οἱ περὶ τὴν Ταυρικὴν χερρόνησον κατοικοῦντες, οὓς ἂν τῶν [p. 92] ξένων παῤ αὐτοῖς ἕλωσι, τούτων δὴ τῶν κατὰ θάλατταν ἐπταικότων, αὐτίκα μάλα τῇ Ταυρικῇ καταθύουσιν Ἀρτέμιδι: 

ταύτας σου τὰς θυσίας Εὐριπίδης ἐπὶ σκηνῆς τραγῳδεῖ. 

For instance, Aristomenes the Messenian slaughtered three hundred men to Zeus of Ithome, in the belief that favourable omens are secured by sacrifices of such magnitude and quality. Among the victims was even Theopompos, the Lakedaimonian king, a noble offering. The Taurian people, who inhabit the Taurian peninsula [north shore of the Black Sea, near Chersonesos], whenever they capture strangers in their territory, that is to say, men who have been shipwrecked, they sacrifice them on the spot to Taurian Artemis. These are your sacrifices which Euripides represents in tragedy upon the stage [Iphigeneia among the Taurians].

Μόνιμος δ̓ ἱστορεῖ ἐν τῇ τῶν θαυμασίων συναγωγῇ ἐν Πέλλῃ τῆς Θετταλίας Ἀχαιὸν ἄνθρωπον Πηλεῖ καὶ Χείρωνι καταθύεσθαι: Λυκτίους 2 γὰρ ῾Κρητῶν δὲ ἔθνος εἰσὶν οὗτοι 3᾿ Ἀντικλείδης ἐν Νόστοις ἀποφαίνεται ἀνθρώπους ἀποσφάττειν τῷ Διί, καὶ Λεσβίους Διονύσῳ τὴν ὁμοίαν προσάγειν θυσίαν Δωσίδας λέγει: 

Monimos, in his Collection of Amazing Things, relates that in Pella of Thessaly human sacrifice is offered to Peleus and Cheiron, the victim being an Achaian. Thus too, Antikleides in his Homecomings, declares that the Lyktians, a Cretan people (ethnos), slaughter men to Zeus. Dosidas says that inhabitants of Lesbos offer a similar sacrifice to Dionysos.

Φωκαεῖς δέ ῾οὐδὲ γὰρ αὐτοὺς παραπέμψομαἰ—τούτους Πυθοκλῆς ἐν τρίτῳ Περὶ ὁμονοίας τῇ Ταυροπόλῳ Ἀρτέμιδι ἄνθρωπον ὁλοκαυτεῖν 4 ἱστορεῖ. 

As for Phokaians – for I won’t pass over them either – these people are reported by Pythokles in his third book On Concord to offer a burnt sacrifice of a man to Taurian Artemis. 

### s37
Ἐρεχθεὺς δὲ ὁ ᾿Λττικὸς καὶ Μάριος ὁ Ῥωμαῖος τὰς αὑτῶν ἐθυσάτην θυγατέρας: ὧν ὁ μὲν τῇ Φερεφάττῃ, ὡς Δημάρατος ἐν πρώτῃ Τραγῳδουμένων, ὁ δὲ τοῖς Ἀποτροπαίοις, ὁ Μάριος, ὡς Δωρόθεος ἐν τῇ τετάρτῃ Ἰταλικῶν ἱστορεῖ. 

(37) Erechtheus the Athenian and Marius the Roman sacrificed their own daughters, the former to Persephone, as Demaratos relates in the first book of his Subjects of Tragedy; the latter, Marius, to the “Averters of evil,” as Dorotheus relates in the fourth book of his investigation of Italian Matters.

Φιλάνθρωποί γε ἐκ τούτων καταφαίνονται οἱ δαίμονες: πῶς δὲ οὐχ ὅσιοι ἀναλόγως οἱ δεισιδαίμονες; οἱ μὲν σωτῆρες εὐφημούμενοι, οἱ δὲ σωτηρίαν αἰτούμενοι παρὰ τῶν ἐπιβούλων σωτηρίας. καλλιερεῖν γοῦν τοπάζοντες αὐτοῖς σφᾶς [p. 94] αὐτοὺς λελήθασιν ἀποσφάττοντες ἀνθρώπους. οὐ γὰρ οὖν παρὰ τὸν τόπον ἱερεῖον γίνεται ὁ φόνος, οὐδ̓ εἰ Ἀρτέμιδί τις καὶ Διὶ ἐν ἱερῷ δῆθεν χωρίῳ μᾶλλον ἢ ὀργῇ καὶ φιλαργυρίᾳ, ἄλλοις ὁμοίοις δαίμοσιν, ἐπὶ βωμοῖς ἢ ἐν ὁδοῖς ἀποσφάττοι τὸν ἄνθρωπον, ἱερὸν 5 ἱερεῖον ἐπιφημίσας, ἀλλὰ φόνος ἐστὶ καὶ ἀνδροκτασία ἡ τοιαύτη θυσία. 

To be sure, the lower spirits (daimones) are kind beings, as these instances plainly show! And how can those who fear the lower spirits help being holy in a corresponding way? The former are hailed as saviours; the latter beg for safety from those who plot to destroy safety. Certainly while they suppose that they are offering acceptable sacrifices to the lower spirits, they forget that they are slaughtering human beings. For murder does not become a sacred offering because of the place in which it is committed, not even if you solemnly dedicate a man and then slaughter him in a so-called sacred spot for Artemis or Zeus, rather than for anger or covetousness, other lower spirits of the same sort, or upon altars rather than in roads. On the contrary, such sacrifice is murder and human butchery. . .  

[remainder of section omitted, followed by book four critiquing the idea of images of the gods].

τί δὴ οὖν, ὦ σοφώτατοι τῶν ἄλλων ζῴων ἄνθρωποι, τὰ μὲν θηρία περιφεύγομεν τὰ ἀνήμερα, κἄν που περιτύχωμεν ἄρκῳ ἢ λέοντι, ἐκτρεπόμεθα, ὡς δ̓ ὅτε τίς τε δράκοντα ἰδὼν παλίνορσος ἀπέστη οὔρεος ἐν βήσσῃς, ὑπό τε τρόμος ἔλλαβε γυῖα, ἄψ τ̓ ἀνεχώρησεν: δαίμονας δὲ ὀλεθρίους καὶ ἀλιτηρίους ἐπιβούλους τε καὶ μισανθρώπους καὶ λυμεῶνας ὄντας προαισθόμενοι καὶ συνιέντες οὐκ ἐκ τρέπεσθε οὐδὲ ἀποστρέφεσθε; τί δ̓ ἂν καὶ ἀληθεύσαιεν οἱ κακοί, ἢ τίνα ἂν ὠφελήσαιεν; αὐτίκα γοῦν ἔχω σοι βελτίονα τῶν ὑμεδαπῶν τούτων θεῶν, τῶν δαιμόνων, ἐπιδεῖξαι τὸν ἄνθρωπον, τοῦ Ἀπόλλωνος τοῦ μαντικοῦ τὸν Κῦρον καὶ τὸν Σόλωνα. φιλόδωρος ὑμῶν ὁ Φοῖβος, ἀλλ̓ οὐ φιλάνθρωπος. προὔδωκε τὸν Κροῖσον τὸν φίλον καὶ τοῦ μισθοῦ ἐκλαθόμενος ῾οὕτω φιλόδοξος ἦν̓ ἀνήγαγε τὸν Κροῖσον διὰ τοῦ Ἅλυος ἐπὶ τὴν πυράν. οὕτω φιλοῦντες οἱ δαίμονες ὁδηγοῦσιν εἰς τὸ πῦρ. ἀλλ̓, ὦ φιλανθρωπότερε καὶ ἀληθέστερε τοῦ Ἀπόλλωνος ἄνθρωπε, τὸν ἐπὶ τῆς πυρᾶς οἴκτειρον δεδεμένον, καὶ σὺ μέν, ὦ [p. 96] Σόλων, μάντευσαι τὴν ἀλήθειαν, σὺ δέ, ὦ Κῦρε, κέλευσον ἀποσβεσθῆναι τὴν πυράν. σωφρόνησον ὕστατον γοῦν, ὦ Κροῖσε, τῷ πάθει μεταμαθών: ἀχάριστός ἐστιν ὃν προσκυνεῖς, λαμβάνει τὸν μισθὸν καὶ μετὰ τὸ χρυσίον ψεύδεται πάλιν. τέλος ἄρα οὐχ ὁ δαίμων, ἀλλὰ ὁ ἄνθρωπός σοι λέγει. οὐ λοξὰ μαντεύεται Σόλων: τοῦτον εὑρήσεις 6 ἀληθῆ μόνον, ὦ βάρβαρε, τὸν χρησμόν: τοῦτον ἐπὶ τῆς πυρᾶς δοκιμάσεις.

Ἐπιδράμωμεν δέ, εἰ βούλει, καὶ τῶν φιλοσόφωι τὰς δόξας, ὅσας αὐχοῦσι περὶ τῶν θεῶν, εἴ πως καὶ φιλοσοφίαν αὐτὴν κενοδοξίας ἕνεκεν ἀνειδωλοποιοῦσαν τὴν ὕλην ἐφεύρωμεν, ἢ 1 καὶ δαιμόνια ἄττα ἐκθειάζουσαν κατὰ παραδρομὴν παραστῆσαι δυνηθῶμεν ὀνειρώττουσαν τὴν ἀλήθειαν. στοιχεῖα μὲν οὖν ἀρχὰς ἀπέλιπον 2 ἐξυμνήσαντες Θαλῆς ὁ Μιλήσιος τὸ ὕδωρ καὶ Ἀναξιμένης ὁ καὶ αὐτὸς Μιλήσιος τὸν ἀέρα, ᾧ Διογένης ὕστερον ὁ Ἀπολλωνιάτης κατηκολούθησεν. Παρμενίδης δὲ ὁ Ἐλεάτης θεοὺς εἰσηγήσατο πῦρ καὶ γῆν, θάτερον δὲ αὐτοῖν μόνον, 3 τὸ πῦρ, θεὸν ὑπειλήφατον Ἵππασός τε ὁ Μεταποντῖνος καὶ ὁ Ἐφέσιος Ἡράκλειτος: Ἐμπεδοκλῆς γὰρ ὁ Ἀκραγαντῖνος εἰς πλῆθος ἐμπεσὼν πρὸς τοῖς τέτταρσι στοιχείοις τούτοις νεῖκος καὶ φιλίαν καταριθμεῖται. 

If you like, now let us survey the opinions which the philosophers, on their part, assert confidently about the gods. Perhaps we may find philosophy herself, through vanity, forming her conceptions of the godhead out of matter, or else we may be able to show in passing that, when deifying certain divine powers, she sees the truth in a dream. Some philosophers, then, left us the elements as first principles of all things. Water was selected for praise by Thales of Miletos; air by Anaximenes of the same city, who was followed afterwards by Diogenes of Apollonia. Fire and earth were introduced as gods by Parmenides of Elea. Yet only one of this pair, namely fire, is god according to the supposition of both Hippasos of Metaponton and Herakleitos of Ephesos. As to Empedokles of Akragas, he chooses plurality, and reckons “love” and “strife” in his list of gods, in addition to these four elements.

Ἄθεοι μὲν δὴ καὶ οὗτοι, σοφίᾳ τινὶ ἀσόφῳ τὴν ὕλην προσκυνήσαντες καὶ λίθους μὲν ἢ ξύλα οὐ τιμήσαντες, γῆν δὲ τὴν τούτων μητέρα ἐκθειάσαντες καὶ Ποσειδῶνα μὲν οὐκ ἀναπλάττοντες, ὕδωρ δὲ αὐτὸ προστρεπόμενοι. τί γάρ ἐστί ποτε ὁ 4 Ποσειδῶν ἢ ὑγρά τις οὐσία ἐκ τῆς πόσεως ὀνοματοποιουμένη; 

ὥσπερ ἀμέλει ὁ πολέμιος Ἄρης ἀπὸ τῆς ἄρσεως [p. 146] καὶ ἀναιρέσεως κεκλημένος, ᾗ καὶ δοκοῦσί μοι πολλοὶ μάλιστα τὸ ξίφος μόνον πήξαντες ἐπιθύειν ὡς Ἄρει: ἔστι δὲ Σκυθῶν τὸ τοιοῦτον, καθάπερ Εὔδοξος ἐν δευτέρᾳ Γῆς 5 περιόδου λέγει, Σκυθῶν δὲ οἱ Σαυρομάται, ὥς φησιν Ἱκέσιος ἐν τῷ περὶ μυστηρίων, ἀκινάκην σέβουσιν. 



τοῦτό τοι καὶ οἱ ἀμφὶ τὸν Ἡράκλειτον τὸ πῦρ ὡς ἀρχέγονον σέβοντες πεπόνθασιν: τὸ γὰρ πῦρ τοῦτο ἕτεροι Ἥφαιστον ὠνόμασαν. Περσῶν δὲ οἱ μάγοι τὸ πῦρ τετιμήκασι καὶ τῶν τὴν Ἀσίαν κατοικούντων πολλοί, πρὸς δὲ καὶ Μακεδόνες, ὥς φησι Διογένης ἐν α Περσικῶν. τί μοι Σαυρομάτας καταλέγειν, οὓς Νυμφόδωρος ἐν Νομίμοις βαρβαρικοῖς τὸ πῦρ σέβειν ἱστορεῖ, ἢ τοὺς Πέρσας καὶ τοὺς Μήδους καὶ τοὺς μάγους; θύειν ἐν ὑπαίθρῳ τούτους ὁ Δίνων λέγει, θεῶν ἀγάλματα μόνα τὸ πῦρ καὶ ὕδωρ νομίζοντας. 


οὐκ ἀπεκρυψάμην οὐδὲ τὴν τούτων ἄγνοιαν. εἰ γὰρ καὶ τὰ μάλιστα ἀποφεύγειν οἴονται τῆς πλάνης, ἀλλ̓ εἰς ἑτέραν κατολισθαίνουσιν ἀπάτην: ἀγάλματα μὲν θεῶν οὐ ξύλα καὶ λίθους ὑπειλήφασιν ὥσπερ Ἕλληνες οὐδὲ μὴν ἴβιδας καὶ ἰχνεύμονας καθάπερ Αἰγύπτιοι, ἀλλὰ πῦρ τε καὶ ὕδωρ ὡς φιλόσοφοι. μετὰ πολλὰς μέντοι ὕστερον περιόδους ἐτῶν ἀνθρωποειδῆ ἀγάλματα σέβειν αὐτοὺς Βήρωσσος [p. 148] ἐν τρίτῃ Χαλδαϊκῶν παρίστησι, τοῦτο Ἀρταξέρξου τοῦ Δαρείου τοῦ Ὤχου εἰσηγησαμένου, ὃς πρῶτος τῆς Ἀφροδίτης Ἀναΐτιδος 6 τὸ ἄγαλμα ἀναστήσας ἐν Βαβυλῶνι καὶ Σούσοις καὶ Ἐκβατάνοις Πέρσαις καὶ Βάκτροις καὶ Δαμασκῷ καὶ Σάρδεσιν ὑπέδειξε σέβειν. ὁμολογούντων τοίνυν οἱ φιλόσοφοι τοὺς διδασκάλους τοὺς σφῶν Πέρσας ἢ Σαυρομάτας ἢ μάγους, παῤ ὧν τὴν ἀθεότητα τῶν σεβασμίων αὐτοῖς μεμαθήκασιν ἀρχῶν, ἄρχοντα τὸν πάντων ποιητὴν καὶ τῶν ἀρχῶν αὐτῶν δημιουργὸν ἀγνοοῦντες, τὸν ἄναρχον θεόν, τὰ δὲ ‘πτωχὰ’ ταῦτα καὶ ‘ἀσθενῆ,’ ᾗ φησιν ὁ ἀπόστολος, τὰ εἰς τὴν ἀνθρώπων ὑπηρεσίαν πεποιημένα ‘στοιχεῖα’ προστρεπόμενοι. 



Τῶν δὲ ἄλλων φιλοσόφων ὅσοι τὰ στοιχεῖα ὑπερβάντες ἐπολυπραγμόνησάν τι ὑψηλότερον καὶ περιττότερον, οἱ μὲν αὐτῶν τὸ ἄπειρον καθύμνησαν, ὡς Ἀναξίμανδρος ῾Μιλήσιος ἦν̓ καὶ Ἀναξαγόρας ὁ Κλαζομένιος καὶ ὁ Ἀθηναῖος Ἀρχέλαος. τούτω μέν γε ἄμφω τὸν νοῦν ἐπεστησάτην τῇ ἀπειρίᾳ, ὁ δὲ Μιλήσιος Λεύκιππος καὶ ὁ Χῖος Μητρόδωρος διττάς, ὡς ἔοικεν, καὶ αὐτὼ ἀρχὰς ἀπελιπέτην, τὸ πλῆρες καὶ τὸ κενόν: προσέθηκε δὲ λαβὼν τούτοιν τοῖν δυεῖν τὰ εἴδωλα ὁ Ἀβδηρίτης Δημόκριτος. ὁ γάρ τοι Κροτωνιάτης Ἀλκμαίων θεοὺς ᾤετο τοὺς ἀστέρας εἶναι ἐμψύχους ὄντας. οὐ σιωπήσομαι τὴν τούτων ἀναισχυντίαν: Ξενοκράτης ῾Καλχηδόνιος οὗτος᾿ ἑπτὰ μὲν θεοὺς τοὺς πλανήτας, ὄγδοον δὲ [p. 150] τὸν ἐκ πάντων τῶν ἀπλανῶν 7 συνεστῶτα κόσμον αἰνίττεται. οὐδὲ μὴν τοὺς ἀπὸ τῆς Στοᾶς παρελεύσομαι διὰ πάσης ὕλης, καὶ διὰ τῆς ἀτιμοτάτης, τὸ θεῖον διήκειν λέγοντας, οἳ καταισχύνουσιν ἀτεχνῶς τὴν φιλοσοφίαν. οὐδὲν δὲ οἶμαι χαλεπὸν ἐνταῦθα γενόμενος καὶ τῶν ἐκ τοῦ Περιπάτου μνησθῆναι: καὶ ὅ γε τῆς αἱρέσεως πατήρ, τῶν ὅλων οὐ νοήσας τὸν πατέρα, τὸν καλούμενον ‘ὕπατον’ ψυχὴν εἶναι τοῦ παντὸς οἴεται: τουτέστι τοῦ κόσμου τὴν ψυχὴν θεὸν ὑπολαμβάνων αὐτὸς αὑτῷ περιπείρεται. ὁ γάρ τοι μέχρι τῆς σελήνης αὐτῆς διορίζων τὴν πρόνοιαν, ἔπειτα τὸν κόσμον θεὸν ἡγούμενος περιτρέπεται, τὸν ἄμοιρον τοῦ θεοῦ θεὸν δογματίζων. ὁ δὲ Ἐρέσιος ἐκεῖνος Θεόφραστος ὁ Ἀριστοτέλους γνώριμος πῇ μὲν οὐρανόν, πῇ δὲ πνεῦμα τὸν θεὸν ὑπονοεῖ. Ἐπικούρου μὲν γὰρ μόνου καὶ ἑκὼν ἐκλήσομαι, ὃς οὐδὲν 8 μέλειν οἴεται τῷ θεῷ, διὰ πάντων ἀσεβῶν. τί γὰρ Ἡρακλείδης ὁ Ποντικός; ἔσθ̓ ὅπῃ οὐκ ἐπὶ τὰ Δημοκρίτου καὶ αὐτὸς κατασύρεται εἴδωλα;

(2) These men also were really atheists, since with a foolish show of wisdom they worshipped matter. They did not, it is true, honour stocks or stones, but they made a god out of earth, which is the mother of these. They do not fashion a Poseidon, but they adore water itself. For what in the world is Poseidon, except a kind of liquid substance named from posis, “drink”? Just as, without a doubt, warlike Ares is so named after arsis and anairesis, “abolition” and “destruction.”

[Scythians and Sauromatians and their war gods]

This is the chief reason, I think, why many peoples simply fix their sword in the ground and then offer sacrifice to it as if to Ares [god of war]. Such is the custom of the Scythians, as Eudoxos says in his second book of Geography, while the Sauromatians, a Scythian people, worship a dagger, according to Hikesios in his book on Mysteries.

[Persian Magians, and contrast with Egyptians]

This too is the case with the followers of Herakleitos when they worship fire as the source of all, because this fire is what others named Hephaistos. The Persian Magians (Magoi / Magi) and many of the inhabitants of Asia have assigned honour to fire. So have the Macedonians, as Diogenes says in the first volume of his Persian History. Why do I need to cite the Sauromatians, whom Nymphodoros [of Amphipolis, third century BCE] in Barbarian Customs [link] reports as worshipping fire, or to cite the Persians, Medes and Magians? Dinon [of Kolophon, fourth century BCE] says that these Magians sacrifice under the open sky, believing that fire and water are the sole elements of divinity.

Even their ignorance I do not conceal. For although they are quite convinced that they are escaping the error of revering idols, they still slip into another delusion. They do not suppose, like Greeks, that stocks and stones are emblems of divinity, nor ibises and ichneumons, after the custom of Egyptians. But they do admit fire and water, as philosophers do. It was not, however, till many ages had passed that they began to worship statues in human form, as Berossos shows in his third book of Chaldean Matters. For this custom was introduced by Artaxerxes [reigning ca. 465–424 BCE] the son of Darius and father of Ochios, who was the first to set up the statue of Aphrodite Anaitis in Babylon, Susa and Ekbatana, and to enjoin this worship upon Persians and Baktrians, upon Damaskos and Sardis.

[Philosophers’ views about four elements derivative of Scythians and Persians]

Therefore, let the philosophers confess that Persians, Sauromatians, and Magians are their teachers, from whom they have learned the atheistic doctrine of their venerated “first principles.” They do not know the great original, the maker of all things, and creator of the “first principles” themselves, God without beginning. Instead, the philosophers offer adoration to these “weak and beggarly elements,” as the apostle calls them, made for the service of men [Paul, Letter to the Galatians 4:9]. . . .

right, / Severe, without pretence, expedient ever, / Fearless and griefless, helpful, soothing pain, / Well-pleasing, advantageous, steadfast, loved, / Esteemed, consistent . . . Renowned, not puffed up, careful, gentle, strong, / Enduring, blameless, lives from age to age.” “Slavish the man who listens to vain opinion, / In hope to light on any good from that.” In these passages he teaches clearly, I think, what is the nature of God, and how common opinion and custom make slaves of those who follow them instead of searching after God.

Nor must we conceal the doctrine of the Pythagoreans, who say that “God is One, and God is not, as some suspect, outside the universal order, but within it, being wholly present in the whole circle, the supervisor of all creation, the blending of all the ages, the wielder of his own powers, the light of all his works in heaven and the father of all things, mind and living principle of the whole circle, movement of all things.”

These sayings have been recorded by their authors through God’s inspiration, and we have selected them. As a guide to the full knowledge of God they are sufficient for every person who is able, even in small measure, to investigate the truth. . . .

Ἴτω δὲ ἡμῖν ῾οὐ γὰρ αὐταρκεῖ μόνον ἡ φιλοσοφίἀ ἀλλὰ καὶ αὐτὴ ἡ 1 ποιητικὴ ἡ περὶ τὸ ψεῦδος τὰ πάντα ἠσχολημένη, μόλις ποτὲ ἤδη ἀλήθειαν μαρτυρήσουσα, μᾶλλον δὲ ἐξομολογουμένη τῷ θεῷ τὴν μυθώδη παρέκβασιν: παρίτω δὴ ὅστις καὶ βούλεται [p. 164] ποιητὴς πρῶτος. 

Let poetry also approach to us (for philosophy alone will not suffice): poetry which is wholly occupied with falsehood— which scarcely will make confession of the truth, but will rather own to God its deviations into fable. Let whoever of those poets chooses advance first. 

Ἄρατος μὲν οὖν διὰ πάντων τὴν δύναμιν τοῦ θεοῦ διήκειν νοεῖ, ὄφῤ ἔμπεδα πάντα φύωνται, τῷ μιν ἀεὶ πρῶτόν τε καὶ ὕστατον ἱλάσκονται: χαῖρε, πάτερ, μέγα θαῦμα, μέγ̓ ἀνθρώποισιν ὄνειαρ. 

Aratus considers that the power of God pervades all things:—

That all may be secure,
Him ever they propitiate first and last,
Hail, Father I great marvel, great gain to man.

ταύτῃ τοι καὶ ὁ Ἀσκραῖος αἰνίττεται Ἡσίοδος τὸν θεόν: 

αὐτὸς γὰρ πάντων βασιλεὺς καὶ κοίρανός ἐστιν, ἀθανάτων τέο δ̓ 2 οὔτις ἐρήρισται κράτος ἄλλος. 

ἤδη δὲ καὶ ἐπὶ τῆς σκηνῆς παραγυμνοῦσι τὴν ἀλήθειαν: ὁ μὲν καὶ εἰς τὸν αἰθέρα καὶ εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν ἀναβλέψας ‘τόνδε ἡγοῦ θεόν,’ φησίν, Εὐριπίδης: ὁ δὲ τοῦ Σοφίλλου Σοφοκλῆς, εἷς ταῖς ἀληθείαισιν, εἷς ἐστὶν θεός, ὃς οὐρανόν τ̓ ἔτευξε καὶ γαῖαν μακρὴν πόντου τε χαροπὸν οἶδμα κἀνέμων βίας: θνητοὶ δὲ πολλὰ 3 καρδίᾳ πλανώμενοι ἱδρυσάμεσθα πημάτων παραψυχὴν θεῶν ἀγάλματ̓ ἐκ λίθων, ἢ χαλκέων ἢ χρυσοτεύκτων ἢ ἐλεφαντίνων τύπους: θυσίας τε τούτοις καὶ κενὰς πανηγύρεις νέμοντες, οὕτως εὐσεβεῖν νομίζομεν. 

οὑτοσὶ μὲν ἤδη καὶ παρακεκινδυνευμένως ἐπὶ τῆς σκηνῆς τὴν ἀλήθειαν τοῖς θεαταῖς παρεισήγαγεν. [p. 166] ὁ δὲ Θρᾴκιος ἱεροφάντης καὶ ποιητὴς ἅμα, ὁ τοῦ Οἰάγρου Ὀρφεύς, μετὰ τὴν τῶν ὀργίων ἱεροφαντίαν καὶ τῶν εἰδώλων τὴν θεολογίαν, παλινῳδίαν ἀληθείας εἰσάγει, τὸν ἱερὸν ὄντως ὀψέ ποτε, ὅμως δ̓ οὖν ᾄδων λόγον: 

φθέγξομαι οἷς θέμις ἐστί: θύρας δ̓ ἐπίθεσθε βέβηλοι πάντες ὁμῶς: σὺ δ̓ ἄκουε, φαεσφόρου ἔκγονε Μήνης, Μουσαἶ , ἐξερέω γὰρ ἀληθέα, μηδέ σε τὰ πρὶν ἐν στήθεσσι φανέντα φίλης αἰῶνος ἀμέρσῃ. εἰς δὲ λόγον θεῖον βλέψας τούτῳ προσέδρευε, ἰθύνων κραδίης νοερὸν κύτος: εὖ δ̓ ἐπίβαινε ἀτραπιτοῦ, μοῦνον δ̓ ἐσόρα κόσμοιο ἄνακτα ἀθάνατον. 

εἶτα ὑποβὰς διαρρήδην ἐπιφέρει: εἶς ἔστ̓, αὐτογενής, ἑνὸς ἔκγονα πάντα τέτυκται: ἐν δ̓ αὐτοῖς αὐτὸς περινίσσεται, οὐδέ τις αὐτὸν εἰσοράᾳ θνητῶν, αὐτὸς δέ γε πάντας ὁρᾶται. 

οὕτως μὲν δὴ Ὀρφεύς: χρόνῳ γέ 4 ποτε συνῆκεν πεπλανημένος. ἀλλὰ σὺ μὴ μέλλων, βροτὲ ποικιλόμητι, βράδυνε, ἀλλὰ παλίμπλαγκτος στρέψας θεὸν ἱλάσκοιο. 

εἰ γὰρ καὶ τὰ μάλιστα ἐναύσματά τινα τοῦ λόγου τοῦ θείου λαβόντες Ἕλληνες ὀλίγα ἄττα τῆς ἀληθείας ἐφθέγξαντο, προσμαρτυροῦσι μὲν τὴν δύναμιν αὐτῆς οὐκ ἀποκεκρυμμένην, σφᾶς δὲ αὐτοὺς ἐλέγχουσιν ἀσθενεῖς, οὐκ ἐφικόμενοι τοῦ τέλους. ἤδη γὰρ οἶμαι παντί τῳ δῆλον γεγονέναι ὡς τῶν [p. 168] χωρὶς τοῦ λόγου τῆς ἀληθείας ἐνεργούντων τι ἢ καὶ φθεγγομένων ὁμοίων ὄντων τοῖς χωρὶς βάσεως βαδίζειν βιαζομένοις. Δυσωπούντων δέ σε εἰς σωτηρίαν καὶ οἱ περὶ τοὺς θεοὺς ὑμῶν ἔλεγχοι, οὕς διὰ τὴν ἀλήθειαν ἐκβιαζόμενοι κωμῳδοῦσι ποιηταί. Μένανδρος γοῦν ὁ κωμικὸς ἐν Ἡνιόχῳ ἐν Ὑποβολιμαίῳ 5 τῷ δράματι οὐδείς μ̓ ἀρέσκει ῾φησἲ περιπατῶν ἔξω θεὸς μετὰ γραός, οὐδ̓ εἰς οἰκίας παρεισιὼν ἐπὶ τοῦ σανιδίου: 

μητραγύρτης 6 τοιοῦτοι γὰρ οἱ μητραγύρται. ὅθεν εἰκότως ὁ Ἀντισθένης ἔλεγεν αὐτοῖς μεταιτοῦσιν: ‘οὐ τρέφω τὴν μητέρα τῶν θεῶν, ἣν οἱ θεοὶ τρέφουσιν.’ 

πάλιν δὲ ὁ αὐτὸς κωμῳδιοποιὸς ἐν Ἱερείᾳ τῷ δράματι χαλεπαίνων πρὸς τὴν συνήθειαν διελέγχειν πειρᾶται τὸν ἄθεον τῆς πλάνης τῦφον, ἐπιφθεγγόμενος ἐμφρόνως 

εἰ γὰρ ἕλκει τὸν θεὸν τοῖς κυμβάλοις ἄνθρωπος εἰς ὃ βούλεται, ὁ τοῦτο ποιῶν ἐστι μείζων τοῦ θεοῦ: ἀλλ̓ ἔστι τόλμης καὶ βίου 7 ταῦτ̓ ὄργανα εὑρημέν̓ ἀνθρώποισιν. 

[p. 170] καὶ οὐχὶ μόνος ὁ Μένανδρος, ἀλλὰ καὶ Ὅμηρος καὶ Εὐριπίδης καὶ ἄλλοι συχνοὶ ποιηταὶ διελέγχουσιν ὑμῶν τοὺς θεοὺς καὶ λοιδορεῖσθαι οὐ δεδίασιν οὐδὲ καθ̓ ὁπόσον αὐτοῖς. αὐτίκα τὴν Ἀθηνᾶν ‘κυνάμυιαν’ καὶ τὸν Ἥφαιστον ‘ἀμφιγύην’ καλοῦσιν, τῇ δὲ Ἀφροδίτῃ ἡ Ἑλένη φησὶ μηκέτι σοῖσι πόδεσσιν ὑποστρέψειας Ὄλυμπον. 

ἐπὶ δὲ τοῦ Διονύσου ἀναφανδὸν Ὅμηρος γράφει ὅς ποτε μαινομένοιο Διωνύσοιο τιθήνας σεῦε κατ̓ ἠγάθεον Νυσήιον: αἱ δ̓ ἅμα πᾶσαι θύσθλα χαμαὶ κατέχευαν ὑπ̓ ἀνδροφόνοιο Λυκούργου. 

ἄξιος ὡς ἀληθῶς Σωκρατικῆς διατριβῆς ὁ Εὐριπίδης εἰς τὴν ἀλήθειαν ἀπιδὼν καὶ τοὺς θεατὰς ὑπεριδών, ποτὲ μὲν τὸν Ἀπόλλωνα, ὃς μεσομφάλους ἕδρας ναίει βροτοῖσι στόμα νέμων σαφέστατα, διελέγχων, κείνῳ πιθόμενος 8 τὴν τεκοῦσαν ἔκτανον, ἐκεῖνον ἡγεῖσθ̓ ἀνόσιον καὶ κτείνετε: 9 ἐκεῖνος ἥμαρτ̓, οὐκ ἐγώ, ἀμαθέστερος γ̓ ὢν 10 τοῦ καλοῦ καὶ τῆς δίκης, 

τοτὲ δ̓ ἐμμανῆ εἰσάγων Ἡρακλέα καὶ μεθύοντα ἀλλαχόθι καὶ ἄπληστον: πῶς γὰρ οὐχί; ὃς ἑστιώμενος τοῖς κρέασι [p. 172] χλωρὰ σῦκ̓ ἐπήσθιεν ἄμους᾿ ὑλακτῶν ὥστε βαρβάρῳ μαθεῖν. ἤδη δὲ ἐν Ἴωνι τῷ δράματι γυμνῇ τῇ κεφαλῇ ἐκκυκλεῖ τῷ θεάτρῳ τοὺς θεούς: 

πῶς οὖν δίκαιον τοὺς νόμους ὑμᾶς βροτοῖς γράψαντας αὐτοὺς ἀδικίας ὀφλισκάνειν; εἰ δ̓, οὐ γὰρ ἔσται, τῷ λόγῳ δὲ χρήσομαι, δίκας βιαίων δώσετ̓ ἀνθρώποις γάμων, σὺ καὶ Ποσειδῶν Ζεύς θ̓, ὃς οὐρανοῦ κρατεῖ, ναοὺς τίνοντες ἀδικίας κενώσετε.




In this venturous manner has he on the stage brought truth before the spectators. But the Thracian Orpheus, the son of Œagrus, hierophant and poet at once, after his exposition of the orgies, and his theology of idols, introduces a palinode of truth with true solemnity, though tardily singing the strain:—

I shall utter to whom it is lawful; but let the doors be closed,
Nevertheless, against all the profane. But do you hear,
O Musæus, offspring of the light-bringing moon,
For I will declare what is true. And let not these things
Which once appeared in your breast rob you of dear life;
But looking to the divine word, apply yourself to it,
Keeping right the seat of intellect and feeling; and walk well
In the straight path, and to the immortal King of the universe alone
Direct your gaze.

Then proceeding, he clearly adds:—

He is one, self-proceeding; and from Him alone all things proceed,
And in them He Himself exerts his activity: no mortal
Beholds Him, but He beholds all.

Thus far Orpheus at last understood that he had been in error:—

But linger no longer, O man, endued with varied wisdom;
But turn and retrace your steps, and propitiate God.

For if, at the most, the Greeks, having received certain scintillations of the divine word, have given forth some utterances of truth, they bear indeed witness that the force of truth is not hidden, and at the same time expose their own weakness in not having arrived at the end. For I think it has now become evident to all, that those who do or speak anything without the word of truth are like people compelled to walk without feet. Let the strictures on your gods, which the poets, impelled by the force of truth, introduce in their comedies, shame you into salvation. Menander, for instance, the comic poet, in his drama of the Charioteer, says:—

No God pleases me that goes about
With an old woman, and enters houses
Carrying a trencher.

For such are the begging priests of Cybele. Hence Antisthenes replies appropriately to their request for alms:—

I do not maintain the mother of the gods,
For the gods maintain her.

Again, the same writer of comedy, expressing his dissatisfaction with the common usages, tries to expose the impious arrogance of the prevailing error in the drama of the Priestess, sagely declaring:—

If a man drags the Deity
Whither he will by the sound of cymbals,
He that does this is greater than the Deity;
But these are the instruments of audacity and means of living
Invented by men.

And not only Menander, but Homer also, and Euripides, and other poets in great numbers, expose your gods, and are wont to rate them, and that soundly too. For instance, they call Aphrodite dog-fly, and Hephæstus a cripple. Helen says to Aphrodite:—

Your godship abdicate!
Renounce Olympus!

And of Dionysus, Homer writes without reserve:—

He, mid their frantic orgies, in the groves
Of lovely Nyssa, put to shameful rout
The youthful Bacchus' nurses; they in fear,
Dropped each her thyrsus, scattered by the hand
Of fierce Lycurgus, with an ox-goad armed.

Worthy truly of the Socratic school is Euripides, who fixes his eye on truth, and despises the spectators of his plays. On one occasion, Apollo,

Who inhabits the sanctuary that is in the middle of the earth,
Dispensing most certain oracles to mortals,

is thus exposed:—

It was in obedience to him that I killed her who brought me forth;
Him do you regard as stained with guilt — put him to death;
It was he that sinned, not I, uninstructed as I was
In right and justice.

He introduces Heracles, at one time mad, at another drunk and gluttonous. How should he not so represent the god who, when entertained as a , ate green figs to flesh, uttering discordant howls, that even his barbarian host remarked it? In his drama of Ion, too, he barefacedly brings the gods on the stage:—

How, then, is it right for you, who have given laws to mortals,
To be yourselves guilty of wrong?
And if — what will never take place, yet I will state the supposition —
You will give satisfaction to men for your adulteries,
You, Poseidon, and you, Zeus, the ruler of heaven, —
You will, in order to make recompense for your misdeeds,
Have to empty your temples.

1 [omitted material]. . .  (11) Now this work of mine is not a writing rhetorically constructed for display. It is a collection of my memoranda stored up for old age as a remedy against forgetfulness, truly an image and outline of those vividly animated discourses which I was privileged to hear and of those blessed and truly remarkable men. One of these men was an Ionian from Greece and the others from greater Greece [i.e. the Greek diaspora]. One from Coele-Syria, one from Egypt, and others from the East. One was born in the land of Assyria, another by origin a Hebrew from Palestine. When I met the last one (who was superior in power), having tracked him down in his hiding-place in Egypt, I found rest. He was the true, Sicilian bee, gathering from the flowers of the prophetic and apostolic meadow a pure substance of true knowledge (gnōsis) in the souls of his hearers. But they preserved the tradition of the blessed teaching derived directly from the holy apostles, Peter, James, John, and Paul, the sons receiving it from the father (but few were like the fathers), came by God’s will to us also to plant those ancestral and apostolic seeds. . .

13 (57) Since truth is one (for the lie has ten thousand routes). Just as the female bacchic devotees tore off the limbs of Pentheus [Euripides, The Bacchai], so the sects (haireseis) of barbarian and Greek philosophy have ripped apart truth, and each sect confidently presents the part it obtained as the complete truth. In my opinion, everything is illuminated by the light of the rising sun. Therefore, let everyone, both Greeks and barbarians, who have reached for the truth (whether possessing quite a bit or just a part of truth) display whatever they have of the word of truth.

For instance, eternity presents in an instant the future and the present, as well as the past. But truth, being much more powerful than limitless time, can collect its seeds even though they have fallen on foreign soil. For we will find that so many thoughts held by such sects – at least those that have not become utterly senseless and are not cut out from the order of nature (by cutting off Christ, as the group of women did with the man [Pentheus]) – even though they appear unlike one another, correspond in their origin and with the truth as a whole. For they coincide in a unity, either as a part or a form or a class. For instance, though the highest note is different from the lowest note, both still create one harmony. With numbers, an even number differs from an odd number, but both are needed for math, and this is also the case with shapes: the circle, triangle, square, and whatever other shapes differ from one another. So also all the parts of the whole universe, though differing one from another, preserve their relation to the whole. So, then, barbarian and Greek philosophy has torn off a piece of eternal truth not from the stories about Dionysos, but from the discourses about God pertaining to the eternally existing word (logos) [identified with Jesus]. Whoever brings the separated pieces back together and makes them one, will without a doubt contemplate the perfect word, the truth.

Therefore it is written in Ecclesiastes 1:16-18: “I acquired wisdom that surpassed all others around me in Jerusalem, and my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge, parables and understanding. This, too, is the choice of the spirit, because in abundance of wisdom is abundance of knowledge (gnōsis).” The one who is conversant with all kinds of wisdom will be, above all, one who knows (gnostikos). Now it is also written, “Abundance of the knowledge of wisdom will give life to him who is of it.” And, again, what this means is clarified by this saying, “All things are in the sight of those who understand” (all things, both Greek and barbarian; but one or the other alone is not complete) “ as is clear to those who wish to receive understanding. Choose instruction over silver, and knowledge above tested gold” (and prefer also perceptivity to pure gold), “for wisdom is better than precious stones, and no precious thing is as valuable as wisdom” [Proverbs 8:9-11].

[Succession of Greek philosophers]

### s59
The Greeks say that after Orpheus and Linos and the most ancient of the poets that appeared among them, the so-called “seven sages (sophoi)” were the first admired for their wisdom. Four of them were from Asia: Thales of Miletos, Bias of Priene, Pittakos of Mitylene, and Cleoboulos of Lindos. Two were from Europe: Solon the Athenian, and Chilon the Lakedaimonian. Some say the seventh was Periander of Corinth, others say Anacharsis the Scythian, and others say Epimenides the Cretan.

Paul knew the latter as a Greek prophet, mentioning him in the Epistle to Titus [1:12-13] where he speaks like this: “It was one of them, their very own prophet, who said, ‘Cretans are always liars, vicious beasts, lazy gluttons.’ That testimony is true.” Do you see how Paul even attributes something true to the prophets of the Greeks, and is not ashamed when building some of them up and shaming others, to make use of Greek poems? When writing to the Corinthians (for this is not the only instance) about the resurrection of the dead, he makes use of a iambic verse from tragedy, saying, “What advantage is it to me if the dead are not raised? Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die. Do not be deceived: ‘Bad company corrupts good character’” [1 Corinthians 15:31-32].)

Others have counted Akousilaos the Argive among the seven wise men, and others Pherekydes of Syros. And Plato substitutes Myso the Chenian for Periander, whom he deemed unworthy of wisdom, on account of his having reigned as a tyrant.

### s60
I will soon show that these Greek sages flourished after the time of Moses. Now we must consider how the style of the sages’ philosophy is Hebraic and enigmatic. They adopted brevity as suited for exhortation, and most helpful. Even Plato says that in the old days this mode was purposely in vogue among all the Greeks, especially the Lakedaimonians [Spartans] and Cretans, who had the best laws. Some attributed the expression, “know yourself” to Chilon. But Chamaileon, in his book On the Gods, ascribes it to Thales and Aristotle ascribes it to the Pythia [prophetess of the Delphic oracle]. It may be an injunction to the pursuit of knowledge. For it is not possible to know the parts without the essence of the whole, and one must study the origin of the universe in order to understand the nature of humanity. 

### s61
Again, to Chilon the Lakedaimonian they attribute “let nothing be too much.” Strato, in his book On Inventions, ascribes this short saying to Stratodemos of Tegea but Didymos assigns it to Solon, and he attributes the saying “a middle course is best” to Cleoboulos. The expression “come under a pledge, and mischief is at hand,” Kleomenes says, in his book On Hesiod, was uttered before by Homer [Odyssey 8.351] in the lines: “pledges of the worthless are worthless pledges.” The Aristotelians consider this to be Chilon’s, but Didymus says the advice was that of Thales. Then, next in order, the saying “all men are bad” or “most men are bad” (for the same short saying is expressed in two ways), Sotades of Byzantion says that it belongs to Bias. And they attribute the aphorism “practice conquers everything” to Periander, as well as attributing the advice “know the opportunity” to Pittakos. Solon made laws for the Athenians, Pittakos for the Mitylenians. And at a late date, Pythagoras, the student of Pherekydes, first called himself a philosopher.

[Three successions of philosophy: Pythagoras, Thales and Xenophanes]

### s62
After these three men, there were three successions of philosophy named after the places where they were active: the Italian from Pythagoras, the Ionian from Thales, and the Eleatic from Xenophanes. Pythagoras was from Samos and was the son of Mnesarchos, as Hippobotos says. According to Aristoxenos, in his Life of Pythagoras, as well as Aristarchos and Theopompos, he was from Tyre. But according to Neanthes, Pythagoras was from Syria or Tyre. So according to most people, Pythagoras was a barbarian by descent.

Thales also was a Phoenician in the accounts of Leander and Herodotos record. Others suppose he was a Milesian. Thales alone seems to have met the prophets of the Egyptians. But no one is described as his teacher, nor is any one mentioned as the teacher of Pherekydes of Syros, who had Pythagoras as his student. 

### s63
But the Italian philosophy, that of Pythagoras, stayed a long time in Metapontium in Italy. Anaximander of Miletos, the son of Praxiades, succeeded Thales; and was himself succeeded by Anaximenes of Miletos, the son of Eurystratos; after whom came Anaxagoras of Klazomenai, the son of Hegesiboulos. Anaxagoras transferred his school (diatribē) from Ionia to Athens. He was succeeded by Archelaos, and Socrates listened to him. (“In fact, the stone-mason, the law-talker, and charmer of the Greeks,” says Timon in his Satirical Poems, because of his leaving physics for ethics.) Antisthenes, after being a student of Socrates, introduced the Cynic philosophy. Plato withdrew to the Academy. Aristotle, after studying philosophy under Plato, withdrew to the Lyceum, and founded the Peripatetic sect. He was succeeded by Theophrastos, who was succeeded by Strato, and he by Lykon, then Kritolaos, and then Diodoros. Speusippos was the successor of Plato, his successor was Xenokrates, and the successor of the latter was Polemo. The students of Polemo were Krates and Krantor, with whom the old Academy founded by Plato ended. Archesilaos was the associate of Krantor; from whom, down to Hegesilaos, the Middle Academy flourished. 

### s64
Then Karneades succeeded Hegesilaos, and others came in succession. The student of Krates was Zeno of Kition, the founder of the Stoic sect. He was succeeded by Kleanthes; and the latter by Chrysippos, and others after him. Xenophanes of Kolophon was the founder of the Eleatic school, who, Timaeus says, lived in the time of Hiero, lord of Sicily, and Epicharmus the poet. Apollodoros says that he was born in the fortieth Olympiad [ca. 620 BCE], and reached to the times of Darius and Cyrus [kings of Persia]. Parmenides, accordingly, was the student of Xenophanes, and Zeno of him; then came Leukippos, and then Demokritos. Protagoras of Abdera and Metrodoros of Chios were students of Demokritos, and Diogenes of Smyrna was a student of Metrodoros, Anaxarchos under him, and so too Pyrrho, and from him Nausiphanes. Some say that Epicurus was a scholar of his. This, in summary, is the succession of the philosophers among the Greeks.

[Chronology to demonstrate Hebrew philosophy was much older than Greek philosophy]

I must next explain in order the chronology of these founders of philosophy in order to show that, by comparison, the Hebrew philosophy was older by many generations. 

### s65
I have already said that Xenophanes was the founder of the Eleatic philosophy. In the Astrological Investigations, Eudemos [of Rhodes] says that Thales predicted the eclipse of the sun which took place at the time that the Medians and the Lydians fought, in the reign of Cyaxares the father of Astyages over the Medes, and the reign of Alyattos the son of Croesus who ruled over the Lydians. Herodotos in his first book agrees with him. The date is about the fiftieth Olympiad [ca. 580 BCE]. Pythagoras is ascertained to have lived in the days of Polykrates the tyrant, about the sixty-second Olympiad [ca. 532 BCE]. Mnesiphilos is described as a follower of Solon, and was a contemporary of Themistokles. Solon therefore flourished about the forty-sixth Olympiad [ca. 596 BCE]. For Heraclitos, the son of Bauso, persuaded Melankomas the tyrant to abdicate his sovereignty. He rejected the invitation of king Darius to visit the Persians.

[Barbarian invention of philosophy as the origins of Greek wisdom]

### s66
These are the times of the oldest sages and philosophers among the Greeks. I hardly need to say that the majority of them were barbarians by extraction and educated by barbarians. Pythagoras is shown to have been either a Tuscan or a Tyrian; Antisthenes was a Phrygian; and, Orpheus was an Odrysian or a Thracian. Most also show Homer to have been an Egyptian. Thales was a Phoenician by birth, and was said to have interacted with the prophets of the Egyptians. Likewise Pythagoras interacted with the same people, by whom he was circumcised so that he could enter the most sacred part of the sanctuary (adyton) and learn from the Egyptians the mystical philosophy. He spoke with the best among the Chaldeans and the Magians, and he gave a hint of what we now call the “assembly” (ekklēsia) [of Jesus followers] in his gathering place for fellow-students (homakoeion) which he maintained.

Plato also does not deny that he imported from the barbarians everything that is best in philosophy, and he admits that he went to Egypt. So Plato writes in the Phaedo [78A] that the philosopher can receive help from all sides: “Great indeed is Greece, O Kebes, where there are good men everywhere, and many are the descent groups (genē) of the barbarians.” (67

So Plato thinks that some of the barbarians are also philosophers. But Epicurus, on the other hand, supposes that only Greeks can philosophize. In the Symposium [209 D-E], Plato praises barbarians as makers of good laws and correctly refers to: “different people in many different places, both among Greeks and barbarians, with many temples established through such fine children.” And it is clear that the barbarians especially honoured their lawgivers and teachers, designating them gods. For, according to Plato [Phaedrus 247 C], they think that good souls leave “the place beyond the heavens” and submit to coming into this Tartaros, taking on a body and sharing all the evils of birth in their care for the family of humankind. It was them who made laws and proclaimed philosophy: “No greater blessing ever came from the gods to humankind, or ever will” [Timaeus 47 A-B].
### s68

(1.68-72) It seems to me that it was because they perceived the great benefit which is brought by sages that the sages themselves were honoured and philosophy cultivated publicly by all the Brahmans [in India] and by all the Odrysians and Getians [in Thrace]. The people of the Egyptians, the Chaldeans [in Babylonia], the inhabitants of Arabia Felix (as it is called), the inhabitants of Palestine, a large portion of the Persian people, and many other peoples alongside them produced sacred discourses about those sages. . . [omitted material].

(68) It seems to me that it was because they perceived the great benefit which is brought by sages that the sages themselves were honoured and philosophy cultivated publicly by all the Brahmans [in India] and by all the Odrysians and Getians [in Thrace]. The people of the Egyptians, the Chaldeans [in Babylonia], the inhabitants of Arabia Felix (as it is called), the inhabitants of Palestine, a large portion of the Persian people, and many other peoples alongside them produced sacred discourses about those sages. It is well known that Plato is always found praising the barbarians, remembering that both himself and Pythagoras learned the most and the noblest of their doctrines among the barbarians. For this reason, Plato also called the descent groups of the barbarians “descent groups of barbarian philosophers.” In the Phaedrus [274 E], Plato recognizes the Egyptian king and shows that he is wiser than the god Thoth (whom Plato knew as Hermes). But in the Charmides, it is evident that he knew certain Thracians who were said to make the soul immortal.
### s69

(69) Pythagoras is recorded as a student of Sonches, the highest prophet of the Egyptians; Plato is recorded as a student of Sechnyphis of Heliopolis; and, Eudoxos of Knidos is recorded as a student of Konyphis, who was also an Egyptian. In his book On the Soul, . . . [missing material]. Plato again clearly recognizes prophecy when he introduces a prophet announcing the word of Lachesis, uttering predictions to the souls whose destiny is becoming fixed. And in the Timaeus [22 B], Plato introduces the most wise Solon learning from the barbarian. The substance of the declaration is to the following effect: “O Solon, Solon, you Greeks are always children. And no Greek is an old man. For you have no learning that is grey with age”.

Demokritos appropriated the Babylonian ethical discourses, for he is said to have combined with his own compositions a translation of the inscription (stelē) of Akikaros. You may find the distinction notified by him when he writes, “thus says Demokritos.” About himself, too, where, bragging about his erudition, he says, “I have travelled the earth than any man of my time, investigating the most remote parts. I have seen the most skies and lands, and I have heard of learned men in very great numbers. And in composition no one has surpassed me. In demonstration, not even those among the Egyptians who are called Arpenodaptians, with whom I lived in exile eighty years, surpassed me.” For Demokritos went to Babylon, Persia, and Egypt, to learn from the Magians and the priests. Pythagoras was enthusiastic about Zoroaster, the Magian of Persia. Those who follow the sect (or: heresy) of Prodikos claim to possess the secret books of Zoroaster.

### s70

Alexander [Polyhistor], in his book On Pythagorean Symbols, reports that Pythagoras was a student of Zaratos the Assyrian (some think that he is Ezekiel; but he is not, as I will show), and claims that, in addition to these, Pythagoras consulted with Galatians and Brahmans. Klearchos the Peripatetic says that he knew a Judean who associated with Aristotle. . . [omitted paragraphs]. . . . Thus philosophy, a thing of the highest utility, flourished in antiquity among the barbarians, shedding its light on the peoples (ethnē). And afterwards it came to Greece. First in its ranks were the prophets among the Egyptians; the Chaldeans among the Assyrians; the Druids among the Galatians; the Samanaians among the Baktrians; those who philosophize among the Celts; and, the Magians of the Persians, who predicted the saviour’s birth, and came into the land of Judea guided by a star.

Herakleitos says that the sibyl [at Delphi] spoke not in a human way but by god’s aid. They say, accordingly, that at Delphi a stone was placed beside the oracle, and the first sibyl, who came from Helikon and was raised by the Muses, sat on it. But some say that she came from Malis, being the daughter of Lamia and granddaughter of Poseidon. In his epic verses, Serapion says that the sibyl contined her divination even after death. He writes that the air that came from her dead body was what caused oracular utterances in voices and omens. Furthermore, when her body decomposed into earth, a grass naturally grew out of it. Whatever animals happened to be there and ate the grass exhibited an accurate knowledge of the future by way of their entrails. He also thinks that the face seen in the moon is the sibyl’s soul. 
### s71

The naked sages (gymnosophists) among the Indians are also in the number, and the other barbarian philosophers. There are two types [among the Indians], some called Sarmanians and the others Brahmans. The Sarmanians are also called Hylobians. Neither of the types inhabit cities, nor live in houses. Instead, they are clothed in the bark of trees, they feed on nuts, and they drink water in their hands. Just like those called Encratites today, they do not marry or have children. Also, some of the Indians obey the precepts of Buddha (Boutta) who they honour as a god because of his extreme holiness. . . [omitted material].

(71) So much for the sibyl.

Numa, the king of the Romans, was a Pythagorean and, aided by the precepts of Moses, prohibited from making an image of god in human form and making an image in the shape of a living creature. Accordingly, during the first hundred and seventy years, even though they built temples, they did not make images in sculpture or painting. For Numa secretly showed them that the highest Good could not be apprehended except by the mind alone. Thus philosophy, a thing of the highest utility, flourished in antiquity among the barbarians, shedding its light on the peoples (ethnē). And afterwards it came to Greece. First in its ranks were the prophets among the Egyptians; the Chaldeans among the Assyrians; the Druids among the Galatians; the Samanaians among the Bactrians; those who philosophize among the Celts; and, the Magians of the Persians, who predicted the saviour’s birth, and came into the land of Judea guided by a star.

Of all these peoples, by far the most ancient is the Judean descent group (genos). Philo the Pythagorean (along with Aristoboulos the Peripatetic and several others who I will not name to save time) shows that the philosophy of the Judeans was put into writing before Greek philosophy. The author Megasthenes, a contemporary of Seleukos Nikanor [reigned ca. 305-281 BCE], clearly writes as follows in the third section of his book On Indian Matters: “All that was said about nature by the ancients is said also by philosophers outside of Greece, some things by the Brahmans among the Indians and others by those called Judeans in Syria.” . . . [omitted material].

(72) Anacharsis was a Scythian, and it is recorded that he was superior to many Greek philosophers. And the Hyperboreans, Hellanikos relates, lived beyond the Riphaean mountains. They learned justice and did not eat meat, but rather nuts. They take everyone who is over sixty years old outside the gates and kill them. There are also among the Germans those called sacred women, who predict future events by inspecting the whirlpools of rivers and the eddies and by listening to the sounds of streams. These women did not allow the men to fight against [Julius] Caesar until the new moon shone.

[Judeans as the oldest barbarian people]

Among all these peoples, by far the most ancient is the Judean descent group (genos). Philo the Pythagorean (along with Aristoboulos the Peripatetic and several others who I will not name to save time here) shows that the philosophy of the Judeans was put into writing before Greek philosophy. The author Megasthenes, a contemporary of Seleukos Nikanor [reigned ca. 305-281 BCE], clearly writes as follows in the third section of his book On Indian Matters: “All that was said about nature by the ancients is said also by philosophers outside of Greece, some things by the Brahmans among the Indians and others by those called Judeans in Syria.” 

### s73
Some of those more inclined to legends say that certain so-called Dactyls of Ida [a mountain on Crete] were the first sages, to whom are attributed the invention of so-called “Ephesian letters” and musical rhythms. For this reason “dactyls” in music received their name. Now the Dactyls of Ida were Phrygians and barbarians. Herodoros [of Herakleia, fifth century BCE] relates that Herakles was a seer and a student of physics [within philosophy] who received the columns of the universe from the barbarian Atlas, the Phrygian, a story which means that he was taught knowledge of the heavenly bodies. Hermippos of Berytos [early second century CE] calls Charon the Centaur wise, about whom the person who wrote The Battle of Giants says, “that he first led the race of mortals to righteousness by teaching them the solemnity of the oath, propitiatory sacrifices, and the figures of Olympos.” Achilles, who fought at Troy, was taught by Charon. Hippo, the daughter of the Centaur, who dwelt with Aiolus, taught him her father’s theory of physics. Euripides also refers to Hippo as follows: “Who first, by oracles, presaged, and by the rising stars, events divine.” By this Aeolos, Odysseus was received as a guest after the taking of Troy. Take note of these dates in comparison with the age of Moses, and with the oldest period of philosophy contemporary with Moses.

[Other Barbarian inventions: Astrology, purity regulations, land-measurement, medicine, etc.]

### s74
Barbarians were inventors not only of philosophy but also of almost of every technical skill. Egyptians were the first to introduce astrology among men, and similarly with Chaldeans. The Egyptians first showed how to burn lamps, divided the year into twelve months, prohibited intercourse with women in temples, and proscribed entry into the temples after contact with a woman without purification. They were also the inventors of land-measurement (geōmetria). There are some who say that the Carians invented prediction based on the stars. The Phrygians were the first who paid attention to the flight of birds. And the Tuscans, neighbours of Italy, paid special attention to sacrifice. The Isaurians and the Arabians invented augury, as the Telmessians divination by dreams. The Tyrrhenians [sometimes identified with Etruscans] invented the trumpet and the Phrygians the flute. For Olympos and Marsyas were Phrygians.

### s75

As Ephoros says, Kadmos was a Phoenician who invented letters among the Greeks, and this is why Herodotos [5.58] writes that they were called “Phoenician letters.” They say that the Phoenicians and the Syrians first invented letters. Apis, an indigenous Egyptian, invented medicine before Io came into Egypt. But afterwards they say that Asklepios improved the technical skill. Atlas the Libyan was the first who built a ship and navigated the sea. Kelmis and Damnaneus, Dactyls of Ida, first discovered iron in Cyprus. Another Idaean discovered the tempering of brass, according to Hesiod, a Scythian. The Thracians first invented what is called an harpē (a curved blade), and they were the first to use shields on horseback. Similarly also the Illyrians invented the round shield called the parma. Besides, they say that the Tuscans invented sculpting with clay, and that Itanus (who was a Samnite) first fashioned the oblong shield. Kadmos the Phoenician invented stone-cutting and discovered the gold mines on the Pangaean mountain. Further, another people, the Cappadocians, first invented the stringed instrument called the nabla, and the Assyrians did the same with the two-stringed instrument (dichord). The Carthaginians were the first that constructed a vessel with four banks of oars (quadrireme), and this was built by Bosporos, who was indigenous. 

### s76

Medea, the daughter of Aietas, a Colchian [modern Georgia], first invented the dyeing of hair. Besides, the Noropians (they are a Paionian descent group, and are now called Noricum [modern Austria and Slovenia]) worked copper, and were the first that purified iron. Amykos the king of the Bebrykians was the first inventor of boxing-gloves.

In music, Olympos the Mysian practised the Lydian harmony. The people called Troglodytes invented the sambuca, a musical instrument. It is said that the crooked pipe was invented by Satyros the Phrygian; likewise also diatonic harmony was invented by Hyagnis, a Phrygian too. Notes were invented by Olympos, a Phrygian; as also the Phrygian harmony, the half-Phrygian scale, and the half-Lydian scale, by Marsyas, who belonged to the same region as those mentioned above. The Doric scale was invented by Thamyris the Thracian.

We have heard that the Persians were the first who fashioned the chariot, bed, and footstool. The Sidonians were the first to construct a vessel with three banks of oars (trireme). The Sicilians, close to Italy, were the first inventors of the phorminx, which is not much inferior to the lyre, and they invented castanets. In the time of Semiramis queen of the Assyrians, they relate that linen garments were invented. And Hellanikos says that Atossa queen of the Persians was the first who composed a letter.

[Summary of Clement’s sources and argument]

### s77 
These things are reported by Scamon of Mitylene [FGrHist 3 B 475], Theophrastos of Ephesos, Kydippos of Mantineia, Antiphanes, Aristodemos [FGrHist 3 B 383] and Aristotle, as well as Philostephanos and Strato the Peripatetic in his books On Inventions. I have added a few details from them in order to confirm the inventive and practical ability of the barbarians. The lifestyles of the Greeks have been improved by them. And if any one objects to barbarian language, Anacharsis says, “All the Greeks speak Scythian to me” [Epistle 1]. Anacharsis was held in admiration by the Greeks. He said, “My covering is a cloak; my supper, milk and cheese” [Epistle 5]. Do you see that the barbarian philosophy offers actions rather than words? 

### s78
The apostle [Paul] says this: “So with yourselves, if you utter speech in a tongue that is not intelligible, how will any one know what is said? For you will be speaking into air. There are doubtless many different languages in the world, and none is without meaning. But if I do not know the meaning of the language, I will be a barbarian to the speaker and the speaker a barbarian to me. . . Therefore, he who speaks in a tongue should pray for the power to interpret.” [1 Corinthians 14.9-11, 13 [RSV adapted].

[Skills in oral instruction and in writing came late to the Greeks]

Yes, and skills in oral instruction and writing entered Greece late. Alkmaion, the son of Perithos, of Krotona [ca. sixth century BCE], first composed a treatise on nature. And it is related that Anaxagoras of Klazomenai, the son of Hegesiboulos, first published a book in writing. The first to adapt music to poetical compositions was Terpander of Antissa [ca. seventh century BCE], and he set the laws of the Lakedaimonians [Spartans] to music. Lasos of Hermione [ca. sixth century BCE] invented the choral hymn (dithyramb); Stesichoros of Himera [ca. sixth century BCE], the hymn; Alkman the Spartan, the choral song; Anakreon of Teos [ca. sixth century BCE], love songs; Pindar the Theban [ca. 518-438 BCE], the dance accompanied with song. Timotheus of Miletos [ca. 450-360 BCE] was the first to execute those musical compositions called “nomoi” on the lyre, with dancing. 

### s79
Moreover, Archilochos of Paros invented iambic poetry, and Hipponax of Ephesos invented “limping iambic” poetry. Tragedy owed its origin to Thespis of Athens [ca. 535-533 BCE], and comedy to Susarion of Ikaria [ca. 581-560 BCE]. Their dates are handed down by the grammarians. But it would be tedious to represent them accurately. resently, however, Dionysos, on whose account the Dionysian spectacles are celebrated, is later than Moses. They say that Antiphon [ca. 480-411 BCE] of Rhamnous, the son of Sophilos, first invented ethical exhortation and rhetorical figures, and was the first to compose a legal defence for a fee, and wrote a forensic speech for delivery, as Diodoros says. Apollodoros of Kyme first assumed the name of critic, and was called a grammarian. Some say it was Eratosthenes of Cyrene [ca. 275-194 BCE] who was first called a grammarian, since he published two books which he entitled Grammatical Matters. The first who was called a grammarian, as we now use the term, was Praxiphanes, the son of Dionysophenes of Mitylene. Zeleukos the Lokrian was reported to have been the first legislator. Others say that it was Menos the son of Zeus, in the time of Lynkeus. He comes after Danaos, in the eleventh generation from Inachos and Moses, as we will show a little further on. And Lykourgus, who lived many years after the taking of Troy, legislated for the Lakedaimonians a hundred and fifty years before the Olympiads. We have spoken before about the time of Solon.
### s80
(80) Drakon, who was also a legislator, has his birth recorded in around the thirty-ninth Olympiad [ca. 624 BCE]. Antilochos, who wrote about the learned men from the age of Pythagoras to the death of Epicurus, which took place in the tenth day of the month Gamelion, makes up altogether three hundred and twelve years [i.e. ca. 582-271 BCE]. Moreover, some say that Phanothea, the wife of Ikarios, invented the heroic hexameter; others say it was Themis, one of the Titanides. However, in his work On the Pythagorean Philosophy, Didymos relates that Theano of Kroton was the first woman philosopher and composer of poetry.

[Conclusion about Greek philosophy]

According to some, Greek philosophy in one way or another teaches the truth accidentally, obscurely, and partially. Others would have it started by the devil (diabolos). Several suppose that certain powers descended to inspire all philosophy [cf. 1 Enoch 1-36]. But even if Greek philosophy does not fully comprehend the extent of the truth and, furthermore, is too weak to fulfill the commandments of the Lord, it nonetheless prepares the way for the truly royal teaching. In some way or another, it offers training, shapes character, and prepares the person who believes in Providence to receive the truth.

(3.94, this paragraph adapted from McCrindle’s translation) The Brahmans neither eat any living thing nor drink wine. Some of them eat food every day, like ourselves, while others among eat once every three days, as Alexander Polyhistor relates in his Indian Matters. They despise death, and set no value on life because they are persuaded that there is a new birth. They worship Herakles and Pan. But those Indians who are called Semnians (Semnai) [compare his reference to Sarmanians above] go naked all their lives. The Semnians practise truth, make predictions about the future, and worship a kind of pyramid beneath which they think the bones of some divinity lie buried. But neither the naked sages (gymnosophists) nor the Semnians have sex with women, because they regard this as contrary to nature and unlawful. For this reason, they keep themselves chaste. The Semnians, too, remain virgins. They observe closely the heavenly bodies and, by the indications about future which these offer, make some predictions.

Chapter 2. The Subject of Plagiarisms Resumed. The Greeks Plagiarized from One Another
Before handling the point proposed, we must, by way of preface, add to the close of the fifth book what is wanting. For since we have shown that the symbolic style was ancient, and was employed not only by our prophets, but also by the majority of the ancient Greeks, and by not a few of the rest of the Gentile Barbarians, it was requisite to proceed to the mysteries of the initiated. I postpone the elucidation of these till we advance to the confutation of what is said by the Greeks on first principles; for we shall show that the mysteries belong to the same branch of speculation. And having proved that the declaration of Hellenic thought is illuminated all round by the truth, bestowed on us in the Scriptures, taking it according to the sense, we have proved, not to say what is invidious, that the theft of the truth passed to them.

Come, and let us adduce the Greeks as witnesses against themselves to the theft. For, inasmuch as they pilfer from one another, they establish the fact that they are thieves; and although against their will, they are detected, clandestinely appropriating to those of their own race the truth which belongs to us. For if they do not keep their hands from each other, they will hardly do it from our authors. I shall say nothing of philosophic dogmas, since the very persons who are the authors of the divisions into sects, confess in writing, so as not to be convicted of ingratitude, that they have received from Socrates the most important of their dogmas. But after availing myself of a few testimonies of men most talked of, and of repute among the Greeks, and exposing their plagiarizing style, and selecting them from various periods, I shall turn to what follows.

Orpheus, then, having composed the line:—

Since nothing else is more shameless and wretched than woman,

Homer plainly says:—

Since nothing else is more dreadful and shameless than a woman.

And Musæus having written:—

Since art is greatly superior to strength,—

Homer says:—

By art rather than strength is the woodcutter greatly superior.

Again, Musæus having composed the lines:—

And as the fruitful field produces leaves,
And on the ash trees some fade, others grow,
So whirls the race of man its leaf, —

Homer transcribes:—

Some of the leaves the wind scatters on the ground.
The budding wood bears some; in time of spring,
They come. So springs one race of men, and one departs.

Again, Homer having said:—

It is unholy to exult over dead men,

Archilochus and Cratinus write, the former:—

It is not noble at dead men to sneer;

and Cratinus in the Lacones:—

For men 'tis dreadful to exult
Much o'er the stalwart dead.

Again, Archilochus, transferring that Homeric line:—

I erred, nor say I nay: instead of many —

writes thus:—

I erred, and this mischief has somehow seized another.

As certainly also that line:—

Even-handed war the slayer slays.

He also, altering, has given forth thus:—

I will do it.
For Mars to men in truth is evenhanded.

Also, translating the following:—

The issues of victory among men depend on the gods,

he openly encourages youth, in the following iambic: —

Victory's issues on the gods depend.

Again, Homer having said:—

With feet unwashed sleeping on the ground,

Euripides writes in Erechtheus:—

Upon the plain spread with no couch they sleep,
Nor in the streams of water lave their feet.

Archilochus having likewise said:—

But one with this and one with that
His heart delights,—

in correspondence with the Homeric line:—

For one in these deeds, one in those delights, —

Euripides says in Œneus:—

But one in these ways, one in those, has more delight.

And I have heard Æschylus saying:—

He who is happy ought to stay at home;
There should he also stay, who speeds not well.

And Euripides, too, shouting the like on the stage:—

Happy the man who, prosperous, stays at home.

Menander, too, on comedy, saying:—

He ought at home to stay, and free remain,
Or be no longer rightly happy.

Again, Theognis having said:—

The exile has no comrade dear and true,—

Euripides has written:—

Far from the poor flies every friend.

And Epicharmus, saying:—

Daughter, woe worth the day!
You who are old I marry to a youth;

and adding:—

For the young husband takes some other girl,
And for another husband longs the wife,—

Euripides writes:—

'Tis bad to yoke an old wife to a youth;
For he desires to share another's bed,
And she, by him deserted, mischief plots.

Euripides having, besides, said in the Medea:—

For no good do a bad man's gifts, —

Sophocles in Ajax Flagellifer utters this iambic: —

For foes' gifts are no gifts, nor any boon.

Solon having written:—

For surfeit insolence begets,
When store of wealth attends.

Theognis writes in the same way:—

For surfeit insolence begets,
When store of wealth attends the bad.

Whence also Thucydides, in the Histories, says: Many men, to whom in a great degree, and in a short time, unlooked-for prosperity comes, are wont to turn to insolence. And Philistus likewise imitates the same sentiment, expressing himself thus: And the many things which turn out prosperously to men, in accordance with reason, have an incredibly dangerous tendency to misfortune. For those who meet with unlooked success beyond their expectations, are for the most part wont to turn to insolence. Again, Euripides having written:—

For children sprung of parents who have led
A hard and toilsome life, superior are;

Critias writes: For I begin with a man's origin: how far the best and strongest in body will he be, if his father exercises himself, and eats in a hardy way, and subjects his body to toilsome labour; and if the mother of the future child be strong in body, and give herself exercise.

Again, Homer having said of the Hephæstus-made shield:—

Upon it earth and heaven and sea he made,
And Ocean's rivers' mighty strength portrayed,

Pherecydes of Syros says:— Zas makes a cloak large and beautiful, and works on it earth and Ogenus, and the palace of Ogenus.

And Homer having said:—

Shame, which greatly hurts a man or helps, —

Euripides writes in Erechtheus:—

Of shame I find it hard to judge;
'Tis needed. 'Tis at times a great mischief.

Take, by way of parallel, such plagiarisms as the following, from those who flourished together, and were rivals of each other. From the Orestes of Euripides: —

Dear charm of sleep, aid in disease.

From the Eriphyle of Sophocles: —

Hie you to sleep, healer of that disease.

And from the Antigone of Sophocles: —

Bastardy is opprobrious in name; but the nature is equal;

And from the Aleuades of Sophocles: —

Each good thing has its nature equal.

Again, in the Ctimenus of Euripides: —

For him who toils, God helps;

And in the Minos of Sophocles;

To those who act not, fortune is no ally;

And from the Alexander of Euripides: —

But time will show; and learning, by that test,
I shall know whether you are good or bad;

And from the Hipponos of Sophocles: —

Besides, conceal nothing; since Time,
That sees all, hears all, all things will unfold.

But let us similarly run over the following; for Eumelus having composed the line,

Of Memory and Olympian Zeus the daughters nine,

Solon thus begins the elegy:—

Of Memory and Olympian Zeus the children bright.

Again, Euripides, paraphrasing the Homeric line:—

What, whence are you? Your city and your parents, where?

employs the following iambics in Ægeus:—

What country shall we say that you have left
To roam in exile, what your land — the bound
Of your own native soil? Who you begot?
And of what father do you call yourself the son?

And what? Theognis having said:—

Wine largely drunk is bad; but if one use
It with discretion, 'tis not bad, but good,—

does not Panyasis write?

Above the gods' best gift to men ranks wine,
In measure drunk; but in excess the worst.

Hesiod, too, saying:—

But for the fire to you I'll give a plague,
For all men to delight themselves withal,—

Euripides writes:—

And for the fire
Another fire greater and unconquerable,
Sprung up in the shape of women

And in addition, Homer, saying:—

There is no satiating the greedy paunch,
Baneful, which many plagues has caused to men.

Euripides says:—

Dire need and baneful paunch me overcome;
From which all evils come.

Besides, Callias the comic poet having written:—

With madmen, all men must be mad, they say,—

Menander, in the Poloumenoi, expresses himself similarly, saying:—

The presence of wisdom is not always suitable:
One sometimes must with others play the fool.

And Antimachus of Teos having said:—

From gifts, to mortals many ills arise,—

Augias composed the line:—

For gifts men's mind and acts deceive.

And Hesiod having said:—

Than a good wife, no man a better thing
Ere gained; than a bad wife, a worse,—

Simonides said:—

A better prize than a good wife no man
Ere gained, than a bad one nought worse.

Again, Epicharmas having said:—

As destined long to live, and yet not long,
Think of yourself.—

Euripides writes:—

Why? Seeing the wealth we have uncertain is,
Why don't we live as free from care, as pleasant
As we may?

Similarly also, the comic poet Diphilus having said:—

The life of men is prone to change,—

Posidippus says:—

No man of mortal mould his life has passed
From suffering free. Nor to the end again
Has continued prosperous.

Similarly speaks to you Plato, writing of man as a creature subject to change. Again, Euripides having said:—

Oh life to mortal men of trouble full,
How slippery in everything are you!
Now you grow, and now you decay away.
And there is set no limit, no, not one,
For mortals of their course to make an end,
Except when Death's remorseless final end
Comes, sent from Zeus, —

Diphilus writes:—

There is no life which has not its own ills,
Pains, cares, thefts, and anxieties, disease;
And Death, as a physician, coming, gives
Rest to their victims in his quiet sleep.

Furthermore, Euripides having said:—

Many are fortune's shapes,
And many things contrary to expectation the gods perform,—

The tragic poet Theodectes similarly writes:—

The instability of mortals' fates.

And Bacchylides having said:—

To few alone of mortals is it given
To reach hoary age, being prosperous all the while,
And not meet with calamities,—

Moschion, the comic poet, writes:—

But he of all men is most blessed,
Who leads throughout an equal life.

And you will find that, Theognis having said:—

For no advantage to a man grown old
A young wife is, who will not, as a ship
The helm, obey,—

Aristophanes, the comic poet, writes:—

An old man to a young wife suits but ill.

For Anacreon, having written:—

Luxurious love I sing,
With flowery garlands graced,
He is of gods the king,
He mortal men subdues —

Euripides writes:—

For love not only men attacks,
And women; but disturbs
The souls of gods above, and to the sea
Descends.

But not to protract the discourse further, in our anxiety to show the propensity of the Greeks to plagiarism in expressions and dogmas, allow us to adduce the express testimony of Hippias, the sophist of Elea, who discourses on the point in hand, and speaks thus: Of these things some perchance are said by Orpheus, some briefly by Musæus; some in one place, others in other places; some by Hesiod, some by Homer, some by the rest of the poets; and some in prose compositions, some by Greeks, some by Barbarians. And I from all these, placing together the things of most importance and of kindred character, will make the present discourse new and varied.

And in order that we may see that philosophy and history, and even rhetoric, are not free of a like reproach, it is right to adduce a few instances from them. For Alcmæon of Crotona having said, It is easier to guard against a man who is an enemy than a friend, Sophocles wrote in the Antigone:—

For what sore more grievous than a bad friend?

And Xenophon said: No man can injure enemies in any way other than by appearing to be a friend.

And Euripides having said in Telephus:—

Shall we Greeks be slaves to Barbarians? —

Thrasymachus, in the oration for the Larissæans, says: Shall we be slaves to Archelaus — Greeks to a Barbarian?

And Orpheus having said:—

Water is the change for soul, and death for water;
From water is earth, and what comes from earth is again water,
And from that, soul, which changes the whole ether;

and Heraclitus, putting together the expressions from these lines, writes thus:—

It is death for souls to become water, and death for
water to become earth; and from earth comes water,
and from water soul.

And Athamas the Pythagorean having said, Thus was produced the beginning of the universe; and there are four roots — fire, water, air, earth: for from these is the origination of what is produced,— Empedocles of Agrigento wrote:—

The four roots of all things first do you hear —
Fire, water, earth, and ether's boundless height:
For of these all that was, is, shall be, comes.

And Plato having said, Wherefore also the gods, knowing men, release sooner from life those they value most, Menander wrote:—

Whom the gods love, dies young.

And Euripides having written in the Œnomaus:—

We judge of things obscure from what we see;

and in the Phœnix:—

By signs the obscure is fairly grasped,—

Hyperides says, But we must investigate things unseen by learning from signs and probabilities. And Isocrates having said, We must conjecture the future by the past, Andocides does not shrink from saying, For we must make use of what has happened previously as signs in reference to what is to be. Besides, Theognis having said:—

The evil of counterfeit silver and gold is not intolerable,
O Cyrnus, and to a wise man is not difficult of detection;
But if the mind of a friend is hidden in his breast,
If he is false, and has a treacherous heart within,
This is the basest thing for mortals, caused by God,
And of all things the hardest to detect,—

Euripides writes:—

Oh Zeus, why have you given to men clear tests
Of spurious gold, while on the body grows
No mark sufficing to discover clear
The wicked man?

Hyperides himself also says, There is no feature of the mind impressed on the countenance of men.

Again, Stasinus having composed the line:—

Fool, who, having slain the father, leaves the children,—

Xenophon says, For I seem to myself to have acted in like manner, as if one who killed the father should spare his children. And Sophocles having written in the Antigone:—

Mother and father being in Hades now,
No brother ever can to me spring forth,—

Herodotus says, Mother and father being no more, I shall not have another brother. In addition to these, Theopompus having written:—

Twice children are old men in very truth;

And before him Sophocles in Peleus:—

Peleus, the son of Æacus, I, sole housekeeper,
Guide, old as he is now, and train again,
For the aged man is once again a child,—

Antipho the orator says, For the nursing of the old is like the nursing of children. Also the philosopher Plato says, The old man then, as seems, will be twice a child. Further, Thucydides having said, We alone bore the brunt at Marathon, — Demosthenes said, By those who bore the brunt at Marathon. Nor will I omit the following. Cratinus having said in the Pytine: —

The preparation perchance you know,

Andocides the orator says, The preparation, gentlemen of the jury, and the eagerness of our enemies, almost all of you know. Similarly also Nicias, in the speech on the deposit, against Lysias, says, The preparation and the eagerness of the adversaries, you see, O gentlemen of the jury. After him Æschines says, You see the preparation, O men of Athens, and the line of battle. Again, Demosthenes having said, What zeal and what canvassing, O men of Athens, have been employed in this contest, I think almost all of you are aware; and Philinus similarly, What zeal, what forming of the line of battle, gentlemen of the jury, have taken place in this contest, I think not one of you is ignorant. Isocrates, again, having said, As if she were related to his wealth, not him, Lysias says in the Orphics, And he was plainly related not to the persons, but to the money. Since Homer also having written:—

O friend, if in this war, by taking flight,
We should from age and death exemption win,
I would not fight among the first myself,
Nor would I send you to the glorious fray;
But now — for myriad fates of death attend
In any case, which man may not escape
Or shun — come on. To some one we shall bring
Renown, or some one shall to us, —

Theopompus writes, For if, by avoiding the present danger, we were to pass the rest of our time in security, to show love of life would not be wonderful. But now, so many fatalities are incident to life, that death in battle seems preferable. And what? Child the sophist having uttered the apophthegm, Become surety, and mischief is at hand, did not Epicharmus utter the same sentiment in other terms, when he said, Suretyship is the daughter of mischief, and loss that of suretyship? Further, Hippocrates the physician having written, You must look to time, and locality, and age, and disease, Euripides says in Hexameters: —

Those who the healing art would practice well,
Must study people's modes of life, and note
The soil, and the diseases so consider.

Homer again, having written:—

I say no mortal man can doom escape,—

Archinus says, All men are bound to die either sooner or later; and Demosthenes, To all men death is the end of life, though one should keep himself shut up in a coop.

And Herodotus, again, having said, in his discourse about Glaucus the Spartan, that the Pythian said, In the case of the Deity, to say and to do are equivalent, Aristophanes said:—

For to think and to do are equivalent.

And before him, Parmenides of Elea said:—

For thinking and being are the same.

And Plato having said, And we shall show, not absurdly perhaps, that the beginning of love is sight; and hope diminishes the passion, memory nourishes it, and intercourse preserves it; does not Philemon the comic poet write:—

First all see, then admire;
Then gaze, then come to hope;
And thus arises love?

Further, Demosthenes having said, For to all of us death is a debt, and so forth, Phanocles writes in Loves, or The Beautiful:—

But from the Fates' unbroken thread escape
Is none for those that feed on earth.

You will also find that Plato having said, For the first sprout of each plant, having got a fair start, according to the virtue of its own nature, is most powerful in inducing the appropriate end; the historian writes, Further, it is not natural for one of the wild plants to become cultivated, after they have passed the earlier period of growth; and the following of Empedocles: —

For I already have been boy and girl,
And bush, and bird, and mute fish in the sea,—

Euripides transcribes in Chrysippus:—

But nothing dies
Of things that are; but being dissolved,
One from the other,
Shows another form.

And Plato having said, in the Republic, that women were common, Euripides writes in the Protesilaus:—

For common, then, is woman's bed.

Further, Euripides having written:—

For to the temperate enough sufficient is —

Epicurus expressly says, Sufficiency is the greatest riches of all.

Again, Aristophanes having written:—

Life you securely shall enjoy, being just
And free from turmoil, and from fear live well,—

Epicurus says, The greatest fruit of righteousness is tranquillity.

Let these species, then, of Greek plagiarism of sentiments, being such, stand as sufficient for a clear specimen to him who is capable of perceiving.

And not only have they been detected pirating and paraphrasing thoughts and expressions, as will be shown; but they will also be convicted of the possession of what is entirely stolen. For stealing entirely what is the production of others, they have published it as their own; as Eugamon of Cyrene did the entire book on the Thesprotians from Musæus, and Pisander of Camirus the Heraclea of Pisinus of Lindus, and Panyasis of Halicarnassus, the capture of Œchalia from Cleophilus of Samos.

You will also find that Homer, the great poet, took from Orpheus, from the Disappearance of Dionysus, those words and what follows verbatim:—

As a man trains a luxuriant shoot of olive.

And in the Theogony, it is said by Orpheus of Kronos:—

He lay, his thick neck bent aside; and him
All-conquering Sleep had seized.

These Homer transferrred to the Cyclops. And Hesiod writes of Melampous:—

Gladly to hear, what the immortals have assigned
To men, the brave from cowards clearly marks;

and so forth, taking it word for word from the poet Musæus.

And Aristophanes the comic poet has, in the first of the Thesmophoriazusæ, transferred the words from the Empiprameni of Cratinus. And Plato the comic poet, and Aristophanes in Dædalus, steal from one another. Cocalus, composed by Araros, the son of Aristophanes, was by the comic poet Philemon altered, and made into the comedy called Hypobolimœns.

Eumelus and Acusilaus the historiographers changed the contents of Hesiod into prose, and published them as their own. Gorgias of Leontium and Eudemus of Naxus, the historians, stole from Melesagoras. And, besides, there is Bion of Proconnesus, who epitomized and transcribed the writings of the ancient Cadmus, and Archilochus, and Aristotle, and Leandrus, and Hellanicus, and Hecatæus, and Androtion, and Philochorus. Dieuchidas of Megara transferred the beginning of his treatise from the Deucalion of Hellanicus. I pass over in silence Heraclitus of Ephesus, who took a very great deal from Orpheus.

From Pythagoras Plato derived the immortality of the soul; and he from the Egyptians. And many of the Platonists composed books, in which they show that the Stoics, as we said in the beginning, and Aristotle, took the most and principal of their dogmas from Plato. Epicurus also pilfered his leading dogmas from Democritus. Let these things then be so. For life would fail me, were I to undertake to go over the subject in detail, to expose the selfish plagiarism of the Greeks, and how they claim the discovery of the best of their doctrines, which they have received from us.
