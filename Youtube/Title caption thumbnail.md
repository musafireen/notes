What did wwii soldiers eat 
sounds more interesting than
Wwii field kitchens, troop rations

Soldiers are strange but eating is familiar
We approach the strange through commonality
such as eating
Such intersection of familiar and strange (in this case neutral word soldier masks the evil warrior)
not further strange things such as field kitchens, troop rations
