Adi **Shankaracharya** (788–820 CE), the proponent of **Advaita Vedanta** (non-dualism), had various influential patrons who supported his philosophical and religious mission. These patrons, both royal and spiritual, played a significant role in enabling his travels across India, his debates with rival philosophers, and the establishment of **mathas** (monastic centers). Here are some of the key patrons of Shankaracharya:

### 1. **Raja Sudhanva of Kasi (Varanasi)**
   - **Patronage**: Raja Sudhanva, the king of Varanasi, was one of Shankaracharya’s earliest patrons. Varanasi has long been a center of learning and spiritual practice, and it was under the patronage of Raja Sudhanva that Shankara was able to establish his influence in the sacred city.
   - **Role**: Varanasi was a major intellectual hub where Shankara engaged in philosophical debates with scholars of different schools of thought, especially Buddhist and Jain philosophers. Raja Sudhanva provided support and resources to assist Shankara in his **mission to revive Vedic knowledge and Hindu practices**.

### 2. **King Amaru of Kashmir**
   - **Patronage**: King Amaru of **Kashmir** is believed to have been a devotee of Shankaracharya. Kashmir was a major center of **Buddhist** learning during this period, and Shankara’s visits there were crucial for engaging with **Buddhist philosophers** and promoting **Advaita Vedanta**.
   - **Role**: Shankara’s travels to Kashmir were not only spiritual but also political in nature, as the region had a strong Buddhist influence. King Amaru’s patronage helped Shankara establish his philosophical authority in this key region. It is believed that Shankara may have **debated with Buddhist scholars** in Kashmir, contributing to the **decline of Buddhism** and the resurgence of **Hindu philosophy**.

### 3. **Mandan Mishra (and Ubhaya Bharati)**
   - **Context**: Though not a royal patron, **Mandan Mishra** was a renowned scholar of **Mimamsa philosophy** and one of Shankara’s greatest intellectual opponents. According to tradition, their debate in **Mahishi** (modern-day Bihar) was a critical turning point in Shankara’s life.
   - **Role**: After their famous debate, which lasted several days, Mandan Mishra was convinced of Shankara’s Advaita Vedanta and became his disciple, helping spread the teachings. His wife, **Ubhaya Bharati**, was the judge of the debate and played a significant role in challenging Shankara’s ideas. Mandan Mishra’s conversion represented **intellectual patronage** as it signified the acceptance of Shankara’s ideas by other prominent scholars.

### 4. **Raja Sudhanva of Sringeri**
   - **Patronage**: Shankaracharya established one of his four primary **mathas** (monastic centers) in **Sringeri**, Karnataka, with the support of Raja Sudhanva (not to be confused with the King of Kasi). This matha, known as the **Sringeri Sharada Peetham**, became an important seat of Advaita Vedanta learning and continues to function to this day.
   - **Role**: The Sringeri matha became a hub for **philosophical inquiry, spiritual practice, and education** in the Vedantic tradition. Shankaracharya was able to consolidate his teachings here, training monks and scholars who would spread the teachings across India.

### 5. **Rajasekhara of Mahishuru (Mysore)**
   - **Patronage**: Rajasekhara, the king of **Mahishuru (modern-day Mysore)**, supported Shankaracharya in his efforts to establish Hindu orthodoxy and consolidate Vedic teachings. His patronage provided Shankara with the resources to establish the **matha at Sringeri** and propagate his teachings throughout South India.
   - **Role**: This alliance with local rulers in the South was crucial for Shankaracharya, as it helped solidify his influence in a region that had been historically dominated by **Shaiva and Jain traditions**. The king's support allowed Shankara to engage in **philosophical debates** and establish his monastic order without political opposition.

### 6. **King Vishnuvardhana of Hoysala**
   - **Patronage**: Although Vishnuvardhana ruled after Shankaracharya’s time, the **Hoysala dynasty** in Karnataka was deeply influenced by the teachings of Shankaracharya, and many rulers, including **King Vishnuvardhana**, patronized the **Advaita Vedanta tradition**. They supported the mathas established by Shankaracharya, including the Sringeri matha.
   - **Role**: Vishnuvardhana’s support helped further **consolidate the Advaita tradition** in South India and allowed the Sringeri matha to grow in influence. Later Hoysala kings, like Vishnuvardhana, helped make the matha a major center of **religious and educational activity**.

### 7. **Patronage of Local Rulers in North India**
   - **Context**: Shankaracharya’s travels through North India, including **Kashi (Varanasi), Prayag, and Kashmir**, were supported by various local kings and patrons. These rulers were keen to see the **revival of Hinduism** and were sympathetic to Shankara’s efforts to restore **Vedic orthodoxy**.
   - **Role**: Through the support of these local rulers, Shankara was able to travel across North India and engage in debates, especially with **Buddhist scholars**, helping to stem the tide of Buddhist influence and re-establish the **authority of the Vedas**.

### 8. **Patronage of Spiritual Figures**
   - **Govinda Bhagavatpada**: Shankaracharya’s **guru**, **Govinda Bhagavatpada**, played a pivotal role in shaping his spiritual philosophy and mission. Govinda was a direct disciple of **Gaudapada**, a key figure in the Advaita tradition. While not a political patron, Govinda's influence was instrumental in **guiding Shankaracharya’s spiritual journey** and mission.
   - **Role**: This form of spiritual patronage enabled Shankara to master the teachings of **Advaita Vedanta** and provided him with the intellectual foundation to spread the philosophy across India.

### Political and Religious Context:
Shankara’s **Advaita Vedanta** emerged at a time of great **religious ferment** in India, with **Buddhism and Jainism** still holding significant influence, particularly in the South and parts of North India. The **Gupta Empire** (4th-6th century CE) had earlier facilitated a **Brahmanical revival**, but by Shankara's time, various regional kingdoms were vying for dominance, with different religious affiliations. 

Shankara’s travels were not only **spiritual** but also had significant **political motives**:
- He worked to **unify disparate Hindu sects** under the banner of **Advaita Vedanta**.
- He **debated Buddhist and Jain scholars** to assert the dominance of **Vedic philosophy**.
- He established **four mathas** in different regions of India, which helped **centralize Hindu authority** and ensure the continuity of Advaita Vedanta across generations.

Shankaracharya's mission and philosophy were greatly facilitated by his **royal patrons**, who saw his work as a way to **strengthen Hinduism** in the face of rising **Buddhist and Jain influences**. These rulers provided the necessary infrastructure, resources, and protection to allow Shankara to **travel, debate, and establish monasteries**, ensuring that his teachings reached a broad geographical area and social strata.
