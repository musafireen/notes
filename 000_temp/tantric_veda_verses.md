Tantrikas, practitioners of **Tantra**, often draw upon various Vedic and non-Vedic sources to justify and legitimize their practices. While Tantra itself developed largely outside the orthodox Vedic tradition, many Tantrikas have looked to Vedic texts for validation. They argue that the core principles and practices of Tantra, such as the use of **mantras**, **rituals**, and **worship of deities**, are rooted in or aligned with Vedic teachings.

Here are some key Vedic verses and concepts that Tantrikas use to justify their practices:

### 1. **Mantras and the Power of Sound**
The use of **mantras** is central to both Vedic and Tantric traditions. Tantrikas often refer to Vedic verses that emphasize the power of sound and speech as sacred and transformative forces.

- **Rigveda 1.164.39**: "The one (the supreme truth) has been described in many ways by the wise, through different mantras."
  - Tantrikas argue that their use of mantras to invoke various deities or energies is consistent with this Vedic idea of the multiplicity of divine expressions.

- **Yajurveda 36.3**: "Vācaspati (Lord of Speech), the giver of speech, may he inspire our speech and bring clarity to it."
  - This verse justifies the use of mantras, as it speaks to the divinity and power associated with speech and sound.

### 2. **Cosmic Unity and Non-Duality**
The non-dual philosophy that underlies much of Tantric metaphysics can also be found in certain Vedic hymns, particularly those that emphasize the unity of all existence.

- **Rigveda 10.90**: The **Purusha Sukta** describes the cosmic being, Purusha, from whom the universe originates and into whom it will dissolve. This concept of cosmic unity is central to many Tantric practices, which focus on realizing the divine unity between the microcosm (the individual) and the macrocosm (the universe).

- **Rigveda 10.129**: The **Nasadiya Sukta**, also known as the Hymn of Creation, speaks of the mystery of the universe's origin, describing how creation emerges from the unmanifest. This aligns with the Tantric idea of **Shakti**, the dynamic creative energy that gives rise to all of existence.

### 3. **Worship of the Divine Feminine**
Tantra places significant emphasis on the worship of the Divine Feminine, or **Shakti**, as the ultimate creative power. Tantrikas often cite Vedic verses that highlight the role of feminine divinities.

- **Devi Sukta** (Rigveda 10.125): This hymn is dedicated to the goddess **Vac** (speech), who is often associated with **Shakti** in later Tantric traditions. In the hymn, the goddess declares her all-encompassing power and presence, saying, "I am the sovereign queen, the treasury of all treasures; I am the all-knowing one, bestower of wealth. I am the one who controls everything."

  This hymn is used by Tantrikas to justify their focus on **Shakti** as the ultimate creative force and object of worship.

### 4. **Ritual Practices**
Many of the intricate ritualistic practices found in Tantra, including offerings, worship, and fire sacrifices, have parallels in Vedic rituals, especially those outlined in the **Yajurveda** and **Atharvaveda**.

- **Yajurveda 5.43**: "O Agni, accept our offering."
  - Tantric rituals often involve the worship of fire (Agni) and offerings to divine energies. This Vedic verse justifies the practice of offering oblations to various deities or forces during rituals.

- **Atharvaveda 9.5.1**: Describes the power of specific mantras and rituals for invoking prosperity, health, and protection. Tantrikas argue that their own rituals are extensions or further developments of these early Vedic rites.

### 5. **Invocation of Deities**
Tantrikas worship a variety of deities, many of whom also appear in the Vedas. They justify their practices by referencing Vedic hymns that praise and invoke these gods and goddesses.

- **Rigveda 1.22.20**: "Let us meditate upon the supreme light of Savitri (the Sun) that may inspire our thoughts."
  - This verse is the basis for the famous **Gayatri Mantra**, which is widely used in both Vedic and Tantric traditions. In Tantra, this mantra is often employed in meditation and ritual to invoke divine light and wisdom.

- **Atharvaveda 10.7.38**: "Homage to the Supreme Goddess."
  - This verse is sometimes cited by Tantrikas to validate their devotion to the Goddess or **Shakti**, which is central to many forms of Tantra.

### 6. **Mystical Practices and Kundalini**
Tantra places great emphasis on **Kundalini**, the dormant spiritual energy within the body that, when awakened, leads to spiritual liberation. While the explicit concept of Kundalini is not directly mentioned in the Vedas, Tantrikas often cite verses that speak to the subtle body, energy centers, or the divine presence within.

- **Yajurveda 17.90**: Describes the "nadi" or subtle channels of the body through which the vital life force (prana) flows. This is used to justify Tantric practices involving the **chakras** and **nadi systems**, which are key to Kundalini yoga.

- **Atharvaveda 10.2.31**: Refers to "serpent-like energies" (similar to the description of Kundalini) within the body, which can be harnessed through spiritual practice.

### 7. **Esoteric and Magical Practices**
The **Atharvaveda** is sometimes seen as the most "esoteric" of the Vedas, as it includes hymns that deal with spells, charms, and other practices aimed at influencing material outcomes, which aligns with some Tantric practices.

- **Atharvaveda 4.37.11**: This verse involves invoking protective forces and divine powers through mantras and rituals for healing and protection. Tantrikas use such verses to support their use of esoteric practices for material and spiritual benefits.

### Summary:

Tantrikas use these Vedic concepts and verses to argue that their practices—mantras, rituals, the worship of deities (especially the Divine Feminine), the subtle body, and even mystical experiences—are consistent with or rooted in Vedic traditions. Despite the significant differences between the two systems, Tantrikas often frame their practices as an extension or deeper exploration of Vedic spirituality.
