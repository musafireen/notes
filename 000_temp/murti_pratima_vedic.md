The practice of creating **murti** (idols) and **pratima** (images) from materials like bronze, wood, and clay is largely a later development in Hinduism, primarily associated with **Puranic** and **Tantric** traditions, rather than the **Vedic** rituals, which focused on **yajnas** (sacrifices) and **agnihotra** (fire rituals). However, later commentators and practitioners often sought to find **Vedic precedents** for these practices by interpreting certain verses in symbolic or esoteric ways.

### Vedic Verses Interpreted to Justify Murti and Pratima:

Although the Vedas do not explicitly prescribe the worship of physical images (murti), later scholars and commentators have referred to specific verses that they interpreted as indications of the permissibility of idol worship or the use of physical representations of the divine. Some of these verses include:

### 1. **Rigveda 10.81.3**:
![[RV#10.81#3]]
   - **Verse**: "He who fixed firm the earth and heaven, who established the vast and lofty sky..."
   - **Interpretation**: This verse has been interpreted symbolically by some later traditions to indicate the divine as the cosmic architect. This act of creation is sometimes seen as a justification for **representing divinity in physical forms** (murti), similar to how the gods fashioned the universe.

### 2. **Taittiriya Samhita 1.6.8**:
[[TS#1.6#8]]
   - **Verse**: This portion describes the crafting of the sacrificial altar (**vedi**) with great precision. In the Tantric and Puranic traditions, the **construction of altars** and the use of precise measurements for rituals have been **extended** to the crafting of images and **murti**. The precision and care required in constructing the vedi are seen as analogous to the care required in creating divine representations like murti.

### 3. **Purusha Sukta (Rigveda 10.90)**:
[[RV#10.90#13-14]]
   - **Verse**: The famous Purusha Sukta describes how the cosmic being (Purusha) pervades the entire universe, with different parts of his body representing different aspects of the cosmos.
   - **Interpretation**: Some interpret this as indicating that **divinity can manifest in material form**, thus justifying the practice of making **murtis** that represent various forms of the divine. This idea aligns with later philosophical concepts that regard the murti as a physical manifestation of the cosmic principle.

### 4. **Shukla Yajurveda (Vajasaneyi Samhita 32.3)**:
![[VS.md#p32#3]]
   - **Verse**: "Na tasya pratima asti" ("There is no image of Him").
   - **Interpretation**: Although this verse explicitly states that the supreme being has no image or form, later interpreters in the Bhakti and Tantric traditions interpreted this as referring to the **formless nature of the ultimate reality**, while still allowing for the creation of **murtis** as symbolic representations of various aspects or forms of the divine, such as Vishnu, Shiva, or Devi.

### 5. **Taittiriya Brahmana 3.1.4**:
![[TB#3.1.4]]
   - **Verse**: Describes various ritual tools and the symbolic construction of the universe through offerings.
   - **Interpretation**: Some later interpreters link this to the construction of **murti** and **pratima**, stating that just as tools and objects are consecrated and used in rituals, so too can images of deities be crafted and consecrated for worship.

### Vedic Hymns on Prana Pratishtha:
   - **Prana Pratishtha** (the ritual of infusing life into a murti) is a crucial part of murti worship in later Hindu practices. Some Vedic verses that refer to **Prana (life-force)**, such as those from the **Taittiriya Upanishad** or the **Atharva Veda** (like **Prana SÅ«kta, Atharva Veda 11.4**), have been interpreted by later traditions to justify the practice of **Prana Pratishtha**, where the deity is invoked into the murti.

### Later Justifications from Puranas and Agamas:
It is important to note that most direct justifications for murti and pratima creation come from the **Agamic** texts, **Puranas**, and **Tantric** literature, which explicitly describe how to create, consecrate, and worship idols. These texts, including the **Vishnu Purana**, **Shiva Purana**, and **Agni Purana**, provide detailed instructions on crafting murtis and performing rituals associated with them.

In the **Puranic** and **Tantric** worldview, the **murti** serves as a physical conduit for the divine presence, making it accessible to devotees. However, this concept is **not directly found in the Vedas** but is later justified by interpreting Vedic hymns in esoteric ways, as done by scholars such as **Lakshmidhara** and other proponents of tantric and devotional (Bhakti) practices.

### Conclusion:
While the **Vedas** themselves do not prescribe the creation of **murti** or **pratima**, later Hindu traditions found ways to connect these practices to Vedic roots by interpreting verses related to the **cosmic order**, **sacrificial altars**, and the manifestation of the divine in the material world. These interpretations, along with the direct instructions found in the **Agamas** and **Puranas**, helped to establish the practice of making bronze, wooden, and clay murtis as part of Hindu worship.
