The Legend of "Abdallah ibn Saba' and the Date of Umm al-Kitab'

SEAN W. ANTHONY

Abstract

"Abdallah ibn Saba' is a figure generally regarded as lilam's first heretic by Sunni scholars and also vilified by Shi'i scholars. In this article an anonymous, esoteric work known as Umm al-Kitäh is examined as it contains an exceptional narrative that adopts a strikingly sympathetic approach to Ibn Saba". It is also argued that the work's unique take on the Ihm Saba' legend sheds considerable light on the date and elusive provenance of this early Shit text

Introduction

In the history of early Shi'ism, there is perhaps no figure more infamous than the arch-heretic Abdallah b. Saba'. The reasons behind his infamy often vary depending on the sectarian outlook of a given medieval author; however, the scorn reserved for Ibn Saba' as Islam's first heretic par excellence is virtually universal. Hence, Sunni and other non-Shi'i authors tend to revile Ibn Saba' as a Jewish interloper from Yemen who, after his (probably feigned) conversion to Islam, introduced and propagated an array of insidious doctrines regarding 'Ali that would, in due course, give rise to Shi'ism and its sectarian reverence for 'Ali b. Abi Talib and his descendents. Such authors attribute to Ibn Saba' manifold, proto-typical Shi'i doctrines of Umayyad-era Shi'ism such as 'Ali's inheritence of Muhammad's authority (al-uasiya), the refractory cursing of Abu Bakr and "Umar b. al-Khattab (al-rafd).
