**Prāṇa Pratiṣṭhā** (the consecration or infusion of life force into an image or object) and **Yantra** (a geometric diagram used as a tool for meditation or ritual worship) are integral elements of Tantric practice. Though these concepts are more elaborately developed within the Tantric and later Hindu traditions, Tantrikas often reference Vedic verses to justify and align these practices with Vedic tradition.

### **1. Vedic Support for Prāṇa Pratiṣṭhā**

Prāṇa Pratiṣṭhā refers to the ritual act of "establishing breath" or "infusing life" into a statue, icon, or object, typically done to consecrate a deity’s image in a temple or during a specific ritual. The practice may not be directly described in the Vedas, but Tantrikas cite certain Vedic verses and concepts that imply the existence of such rituals involving the invocation of prāṇa (vital life force).

#### Key Vedic Verses and Concepts:

- **Rigveda 10.90 (Purusha Sukta)**:
- ![[RV#10.90#13]]
   - In this hymn, the cosmic being **Purusha** sacrifices himself, and the entire creation emanates from him. This idea of infusing life into matter is foundational for understanding how prāṇa (life force) animates physical forms.
   - The verse suggests the universe and all living beings are animated by the life force derived from the cosmic source, which Tantrikas see as parallel to the act of consecrating a deity's image with prāṇa.

- **Yajurveda 36.3** (From the Taittiriya Samhita):
   - "O Prāṇa, the all-pervading force, you pervade everything. May you sustain the cosmos."
   - This mantra highlights **Prāṇa** as the all-pervading vital force. Tantrikas use this to justify that Prāṇa is the energy that can be invoked and infused into sacred objects or icons, giving them divine life.
### vajasaneyi equivalent to taittiriya 36.3
The hymn to **Prāṇa** cited in **Taittiriya Samhita 36.3** is part of the **Krishna Yajurveda** tradition and is dedicated to Prāṇa, the life force. This particular verse (TS 36.3) praises **Prāṇa** as the vital life force that sustains all life and is regarded as all-encompassing. However, the **Vajasaneyi Samhita** and the **Shatapatha Brahmana** belong to the **Shukla Yajurveda** tradition, and there are differences in the arrangement and content of these two branches of the Yajurveda.

While the **Krishna Yajurveda** (Taittiriya Samhita) and **Shukla Yajurveda** (Vajasaneyi Samhita and Shatapatha Brahmana) share many common hymns and rituals, the specific verses dedicated to Prāṇa in **Taittiriya Samhita 36.3** are **not found exactly in the same form** in the Vajasaneyi Samhita or Shatapatha Brahmana. 

That being said, there are hymns and passages in the **Shukla Yajurveda** (Vajasaneyi Samhita) and **Shatapatha Brahmana** that deal with the concept of **Prāṇa** as the vital life force, but the exact hymn (TS 36.3) is specific to the **Krishna Yajurveda** tradition.

### Related Verses in Vajasaneyi Samhita and Shatapatha Brahmana:
1. **Vajasaneyi Samhita (Shukla Yajurveda)** does contain hymns that praise Prāṇa, but they are presented differently and may not appear as a singular hymn like in Taittiriya Samhita.
   - **Vajasaneyi Samhita 34.5**: References Prāṇa as one of the vital forces in the universe.
   - ![[VS.md#p34]]
   
2. **Shatapatha Brahmana (associated with Shukla Yajurveda)**:
   - The **Shatapatha Brahmana** contains discussions on **Prāṇa** in the context of rituals, specifically in relation to the fire sacrifice (Agni), as Prāṇa is often equated with the sustaining power of life and the breath of the cosmos. However, these are more philosophical and ritual discussions rather than hymns directly praising Prāṇa.

In summary, the **hymn to Prāṇa** as found in **Taittiriya Samhita 36.3** is specific to the **Krishna Yajurveda** tradition, and although similar concepts of Prāṇa are discussed in the **Shukla Yajurveda** (Vajasaneyi Samhita) and **Shatapatha Brahmana**, they do not contain the exact same hymn.

- **Atharvaveda 11.4.24**:
- ![[AV.ŚS#11.4#24]]
   - This verse refers to the invocation of life and prāṇa through sacred rites, calling upon divine forces to bless and empower objects or beings.
   - Tantrikas interpret this as a Vedic precedent for the practice of empowering statues and other objects through ritual, closely relating to Prāṇa Pratiṣṭhā.

- **Atharvaveda 9.2.10**:
   - "Let the Prāṇa and Apāna (the in-breath and out-breath) fill this (object/person) with life."
   - This verse emphasizes the importance of vital forces, which are central to both life and ritual practices. It is used to justify the infusion of life energy into a deity's icon during consecration ceremonies.
### correct verse for atharvaveda 9.2.10
No, **Atharva Veda 9.2.10** is not the correct verse when referring to the concept of **Prāṇa** and **Apāna** (the vital breath and out-breath). This verse reference is incorrect for discussing the Prāṇa-related concepts typically cited in the context of Vedic rituals or consecration practices.

### Correct Atharva Veda Verses Related to Prāṇa:

- **Atharva Veda 11.4.9**: This verse speaks of **Prāṇa** (vital breath) as being the sustainer of all life and creation, which is a common theme when discussing Prāṇa in the Vedas.
![[AV.ŚS#11.4#24]]

  Translation (rough):
  > "The Prāṇa is the soul of the universe; it is the life of all that breathes. May it remain with us, guiding and sustaining us."

- **Atharva Veda 15.1.4**: This verse is often quoted in relation to **Prāṇa** and **Apāna**, stating that all living beings are supported by these life forces.

- **Atharva Veda 10.2.31**: This verse also mentions the importance of **Prāṇa** and **Apāna** as sustaining forces within human beings and the cosmos, highlighting their role in maintaining balance and life.
![[AV.ŚS#10.2#13]]

The **Prāṇa** and **Apāna** are vital breaths discussed across multiple Vedic texts (including the Rig Veda and Yajur Veda) and play an important role in Vedic cosmology and ritual practices. They symbolize the life force that supports all beings and are crucial elements in both Vedic and Tantric thought.

### Conclusion:
For the concept of **Prāṇa** and **Apāna**, a more accurate reference in the **Atharva Veda** would be passages like **Atharva Veda 11.4.9** or **Atharva Veda 15.1.4**, rather than **Atharva Veda 9.2.10**.

### **2. Vedic Support for Yantra**

A **Yantra** is a geometric design or diagram, often considered the physical representation of divine forces, and it is used for meditation or as a focal point in rituals. While the explicit use of Yantras as geometric tools is more elaborated in Tantric texts, certain Vedic references to sacred geometry and symbolic diagrams are cited to support their usage.

#### Key Vedic Verses and Concepts:

- **Rigveda 10.90.1 (Purusha Sukta)**:
![[RV#10.90#1]]
   - "The Purusha has a thousand heads, a thousand eyes, and a thousand feet."
   - While this verse describes the cosmic being **Purusha**, it also symbolizes the divine as the source of all form and space. The Yantra, with its intricate and precise geometric patterns, is often seen as a representation of the cosmic form of the deity.
   - Tantrikas use this hymn to argue that the Yantra is a geometric manifestation of the universal cosmic structure.

- **Yajurveda 17.78**:
   - This verse refers to the creation of sacred fire altars in geometric shapes during Vedic rituals. These fire altars were often designed as sacred diagrams, with precise measurements and geometric symbolism.
   - The use of these sacred altars (Chiti) in Vedic rituals is considered a precursor to the Tantric use of **Yantras**, which are seen as microcosmic representations of the divine energy.

- **Rigveda 1.164.11**:
![[RV#1.164#11]]
   - "The wheel with twelve spokes does not decay as it revolves around the heavens."
   - This verse speaks metaphorically of the cosmic wheel and its divisions, which is interpreted symbolically. Tantrikas cite this to draw parallels with the **Sri Yantra** and other sacred geometrical figures, representing the cosmos and divine forces.

- **Atharvaveda 10.1.32**:
![[AV.ŚS#10.2#31-32]]
   - This verse describes the universe in terms of symbolic geometric and numerical relationships, aligning with the Tantric use of Yantras to represent cosmic forces and energies through geometrical patterns.
   - Tantrikas argue that the use of symbolic representations and numbers in this verse provides Vedic legitimacy to the later development of Yantras in their rituals.

- **Sulbasutras (Vedic texts on geometry)**:
   - The **Sulbasutras**, part of the Vedic corpus, contain instructions on constructing altars with geometric precision and symbolic significance. These geometric shapes are seen as ancestral forms of Yantras.
   - Tantrikas cite these geometrical constructs as a direct precursor to their own use of **Yantras** in ritual worship.
### lakshmidhara
Lakshmidhara, the medieval scholar known for his extensive work in the field of **Tantra** and **Smriti** literature, was among those who attempted to reconcile tantric practices with Vedic authority by citing passages from various Vedic texts, including the **Taittiriya Brahmana** and **Taittiriya Aranyaka**, to support the use of **Yantra** and related practices.

While there are no explicit references to **Yantras** (geometrical diagrams) as we understand them today in the Vedic literature, Lakshmidhara, like many later tantric interpreters, took certain verses from the **Taittiriya Brahmana** and **Taittiriya Aranyaka** and **reinterpreted them** symbolically or metaphysically to justify tantric concepts, such as the use of **Yantras**.

The verses Lakshmidhara pointed to are not always straightforward, and often their connection to **Yantra** practices is established through **allegorical or esoteric interpretation**. Some of these verses include descriptions of rituals, offerings, and cosmic correspondences, which are then connected to the Tantric use of diagrams for spiritual purposes.

### Possible Verses and Interpretations:

1. **Taittiriya Brahmana 3.1.4**:
![[TB#3.1.4]]
   This section speaks of the creation of cosmic order through rituals and offerings, connecting the macrocosm (the universe) to the microcosm (the individual). Lakshmidhara and other Tantric commentators have sometimes reinterpreted such passages to indicate the use of **Yantras** as instruments for aligning the microcosmic self with the macrocosmic divine energies. The geometric precision of Yantras was seen as mirroring the cosmic order mentioned in these rituals.

2. **Taittiriya Aranyaka 10.1 (Mahanarayana Upanishad)**:
![[TA#10.1#]]
   In this section, various deities and cosmic forces are invoked, and there is a description of the **primordial sounds** and their connection to creation. The focus on specific sounds (seed sounds or **bija mantras**) and their power over creation and manifestation has been linked to the **Tantric practice of using Yantras** as visual tools for focusing and invoking these divine forces. Lakshmidhara and others might interpret this as evidence of the Vedic roots of Yantras, particularly when connected to the mystical syllables inscribed in the **Bhuvaneshvari** Yantra and other Tantric diagrams.

3. **Taittiriya Aranyaka 1.23**:
![[TA#1.23#]]
   This verse speaks about the **deities of the directions (Dikpalas)** and their influence in various realms. Tantric Yantras often include the deities of the directions, with specific deities placed in each quadrant or part of the Yantra. Lakshmidhara may have used this as an allegorical reference to the placement of deities within the structure of Yantras, aligning Vedic concepts with Tantric diagrams.

4. **Taittiriya Brahmana 2.1.6**:
![[TB#2.1.6]]
   This verse refers to the arrangement and consecration of **sacrificial altars (vedi)**, where each part of the altar is said to correspond to cosmic elements. The altar is, in many ways, considered a **precursor to Yantras**. The precision with which these altars are constructed and the symbolic geometry involved were used by later scholars like Lakshmidhara to draw parallels with the geometric forms of Yantras, arguing that the ritual construction of these altars prefigures the sacred geometry of Yantras.
#### saundarya lahari
In his commentary on **Saundaryalahari**, particularly when discussing **Śrī Yantra** or **Śrī Vidyā**, **Lakshmidhara** refers to certain verses from the **Taittiriya Brahmana** and **Taittiriya Aranyaka** to draw esoteric connections to these Tantric practices. Although specific Vedic verses do not directly mention **Śrī Yantra** or **Śrī Vidyā**, Lakshmidhara, like many Tantric scholars, interprets Vedic passages symbolically.

### Verses Cited by Lakshmidhara:

1. **Taittiriya Brahmana 2.3.8** – This verse discusses the **Śrī Sūkta**, which praises the goddess Lakshmi (who is closely associated with Śrī Vidyā). Lakshmidhara interprets this as an indication of **Śrī Vidyā's** presence in the Vedic texts.
![[TB#2.3.8]]

3. **Taittiriya Aranyaka 10.1 (Mahanarayana Upanishad)** – In this section, the invocation of various deities, especially those related to the **goddess principle**, is linked to the concept of **Śrī Yantra**, where these deities are placed within specific geometrical arrangements in the Yantra.
![[TA#10.1#5]]

These references are allegorical, and Lakshmidhara draws these connections through symbolic interpretations rather than direct mention of Śrī Yantra.

### Summary:
Lakshmidhara, in his works, reinterpreted certain Vedic verses related to **cosmic order, sacrificial altars, directional deities**, and **sacred sounds** from the **Taittiriya Brahmana** and **Taittiriya Aranyaka** to support the idea that the **use of Yantras** is not only Tantric but also rooted in Vedic tradition. Though **Yantra** as a specific practice is not explicitly mentioned in these texts, through allegorical and esoteric interpretations, scholars like Lakshmidhara sought to establish a continuity between Vedic and Tantric practices.
### **Summary of Vedic Justifications:**

- **Prāṇa Pratiṣṭhā** is supported by Vedic verses that emphasize the life-giving force of Prāṇa and its ability to animate and pervade all things. Verses from the Rigveda, Yajurveda, and Atharvaveda that discuss the cosmic life force, the importance of prāṇa, and the infusion of life into objects are used by Tantrikas to justify their consecration practices.

- **Yantras** are justified through Vedic references to sacred geometry, the use of symbolic shapes in rituals, and descriptions of the universe's structure. Verses from the Rigveda, Yajurveda, and the Sulbasutras, which discuss geometric representations and cosmic order, are interpreted as precursors to the later Tantric use of Yantras as symbolic and meditative tools.

Thus, while the explicit use of **Prāṇa Pratiṣṭhā** and **Yantra** is not directly described in the Vedas, Tantrikas reference Vedic concepts of cosmic energy, sacred sound, and geometry to legitimize their practices.

# ritual use of prana

In the **Shatapatha Brahmana**, particularly in the context of Vedic ritualism, **Prāṇa** (the life force or breath) plays a significant symbolic and functional role. It is considered the vital energy that sustains life, pervades the universe, and is essential for the efficacy of sacrificial rites. Throughout the **Shatapatha Brahmana**, **Prāṇa** is referenced in both literal and metaphorical contexts, especially in relation to various rituals, fire sacrifices (Agni-related rites), and cosmic functions.

### **Key Ritual Uses of Prāṇa in the Shatapatha Brahmana:**

1. **Prāṇa as the Sustaining Power of Rituals**:
   - In the **Shatapatha Brahmana**, **Prāṇa** is often equated with the sustaining power that underpins the success and effectiveness of rituals. In this sense, it is seen as the force that enlivens and empowers both the sacrificer (yajamāna) and the sacrificial offerings. Just as **Prāṇa** sustains life in the body, it is believed that **Prāṇa** sustains the sacrifice and the cosmos.
   
   - **Shatapatha Brahmana 2.2.2.6**: This passage describes **Prāṇa** as **the vital breath that upholds the body** and the universe. It is through the act of breathing that the sacrificer is connected to the cosmos, making the sacrificial acts fruitful.
   
   - **Shatapatha Brahmana 10.4.2.23**: It highlights that the ritual is incomplete without the vital **Prāṇa**, the life force of the sacrificer. The sacrificer offers a part of their own **Prāṇa** or vital breath to the gods, who are themselves sustained by **Prāṇa**.
![[SpB#10.4.2#1-3+18]]
![[SpB#10.4.2#26-27]]
![[SpB#10.4.2#26]]

2. **Prāṇa and the Fire Sacrifice (Agni)**:
   - **Prāṇa** is closely associated with **Agni** (fire), the primary focus of many Vedic sacrifices. Fire, like **Prāṇa**, is considered a vital, life-sustaining force. When fire is kindled in the ritual, it is metaphorically linked with **Prāṇa**, as it animates the sacrifice and connects the human realm with the divine.

   - **Shatapatha Brahmana 11.1.6.14**: In this passage, it is said that **Agni** and **Prāṇa** are both essential for life and for the performance of the sacrifice. Agni (fire) represents the external manifestation of the sacrificial fire, while **Prāṇa** represents the internal fire or life force within the sacrificer.
![[SpB#11.1.6#7]]
![[SpB#11.1.6#14]]
3. **Prāṇa and the Sacrificer (Yajamāna)**:
   - **Prāṇa** is identified with the sacrificer (yajamāna) in many ways. The sacrificer is often considered a microcosm of the universe, and the **Prāṇa** within them represents the cosmic **Prāṇa** that animates the entire universe.

   - **Shatapatha Brahmana 1.9.2.4**: Here, it is said that just as the universe is sustained by **Prāṇa**, the yajamāna’s **Prāṇa** sustains the sacrifice. The act of breathing (Prāṇa) is seen as an offering in itself, and the sacrificer must be conscious of their breath during the performance of the rites.

   - **Shatapatha Brahmana 10.3.3.12**: In this passage, **Prāṇa** is directly connected to the well-being of the sacrificer. It is stated that one who offers their **Prāṇa** in the proper ritual context ensures their own immortality and the continuity of the universe.

4. **Prāṇa and Offerings (Oblations)**:
   - **Prāṇa** is often connected with the physical offerings (oblations) made during the sacrifice. Just as **Prāṇa** animates the body, the offerings made into the sacrificial fire are seen as infused with **Prāṇa**. The oblations offered to the gods are considered to be filled with the **Prāṇa** of the sacrificer, making the offerings efficacious and ensuring that the gods accept them.

   - **Shatapatha Brahmana 1.9.1.12**: In this section, the oblations (such as ghee, grains, or animal offerings) are described as symbolically connected to **Prāṇa**. The act of offering is seen as transferring the sacrificer’s own life force (Prāṇa) to the gods, thereby nourishing both the gods and the universe.
![[SpB#1.9.1#15]]

5. **Prāṇa and the Soma Sacrifice**:
   - The **Soma sacrifice** is one of the most important Vedic rituals, and **Prāṇa** plays a crucial role in its symbolism. Soma is often considered the drink of the gods, and its consumption by the sacrificer is linked to the rejuvenation of **Prāṇa**.

   - **Shatapatha Brahmana 9.3.4.16**: This passage describes how the consumption of Soma restores and strengthens **Prāṇa** within the sacrificer. The sacrifice itself is seen as an offering of the **Prāṇa** of the plants (Soma) back to the cosmic forces that sustain the universe.

6. **Prāṇa as the Connecting Link between Heaven and Earth**:
   - In the Vedic worldview, **Prāṇa** serves as the connecting link between the terrestrial (earthly) and celestial (divine) realms. Through the proper performance of ritual, the sacrificer can utilize their **Prāṇa** to connect with higher realms.

   - **Shatapatha Brahmana 6.1.1.10**: In this passage, **Prāṇa** is identified as the mediator between heaven and earth, between the gods and humans. This reflects the Tantric idea that through breath and ritual, the human and divine can become interconnected.
![[SpB#6.1.1#4]]

7. **Prāṇa in the Context of the Five Vital Breaths (Pancha Prāṇas)**:
   - The **Shatapatha Brahmana** also refers to the five vital breaths or **Pancha Prāṇas** (Prāṇa, Apāna, Vyāna, Udāna, Samāna), which are essential for the physical and spiritual well-being of the sacrificer. These breaths are invoked in the context of specific rituals, with each representing different aspects of life force and bodily functions.

   - **Shatapatha Brahmana 14.5.1.10**: In the great **Ashvamedha** (horse sacrifice), the five vital breaths are invoked, each corresponding to different parts of the ritual and the cosmic order. The **Prāṇa** is particularly important, as it is the force that sustains all aspects of the sacrifice.
![[SpB#14.]]

### **Conclusion:**
In the **Shatapatha Brahmana**, **Prāṇa** is not only the vital life force that animates living beings but also a crucial metaphysical and ritual principle that ensures the efficacy of Vedic sacrifices. It serves as a cosmic link between the sacrificer, the sacrifice, and the gods. Whether in fire sacrifices, the Soma ritual, or as part of the life-sustaining breath, **Prāṇa** is understood as the fundamental force that supports life, the universe, and the proper functioning of rituals. Through the offerings and the ritual performance, **Prāṇa** is offered back to the divine, completing a cycle of cosmic sustenance.
