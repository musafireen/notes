00:00:00.240 Hey there, welcome in. Before we begin
00:00:02.879 tonight's journey into one of the most
00:00:04.960 powerful empires the world has ever
00:00:06.759 seen, let's take a moment, if you're
00:00:09.280 listening right now, tell us in the
00:00:11.200 comments where you're tuning in from and
00:00:14.000 what time it is for you. We love hearing
00:00:16.079 how far and wide this little sleep
00:00:19.199 sanctuary reaches. And while you're
00:00:21.039 here, don't forget to hit subscribe.
00:00:23.920 That way, you'll never miss a single
00:00:26.080 slow burning saga or whispered war story
00:00:29.119 from the past. All right, you're here.
00:00:32.079 You're comfortable. And for the next few
00:00:34.079 hours, you don't have to worry about
00:00:36.079 anything else. We're going to take a
00:00:38.559 walk or maybe a long lazy march through
00:00:42.000 centuries of ambition, betrayal,
00:00:45.000 invention, power, collapse, and rebirth.
00:00:48.640 This is the Roman Empire. But Rome, Rome
00:00:52.079 doesn't start with roads or swords or
00:00:54.559 emperors in marble busts. It starts with
00:00:57.360 a river, a basket, and two babies. No
00:01:00.719 one truly knows if Romulus and Reheis
00:01:03.120 were real. That's okay. What matters is
00:01:05.920 that they felt real to the Romans. Their
00:01:08.560 story was the Romans version of a fairy
00:01:11.000 tale. Only their fairy tales usually
00:01:13.920 ended with someone getting stabbed or
00:01:16.640 founding a city. According to the old
00:01:19.320 legends, these twins were born of divine
00:01:22.320 blood. Their mother Rya Sylvia was a
00:01:26.080 vestal virgin sworn to chastity and
00:01:29.680 their father was Mars. Yes, that Mars,
00:01:33.119 the god of war, which already explains a
00:01:35.600 lot about how Roman history went.
00:01:38.600 Naturally, this was a problem. Ria
00:01:41.119 Sylvia's uncle, King
00:01:43.000 Amelius, wasn't exactly excited about
00:01:45.600 two god-touched infants possibly growing
00:01:48.159 up to take his throne. So, he did what
00:01:50.399 most bad uncles in myth do. He ordered
00:01:53.119 them to be thrown into the river and
00:01:55.040 left to drown. But the river Tyber had
00:01:57.520 other plans. The water didn't rise up in
00:02:00.320 rage or part like the sea in a movie.
00:02:03.200 Instead, it simply carried the boys
00:02:05.920 gently downstream, cradled in a basket.
00:02:09.119 There's something poetic about that. And
00:02:11.280 how the same river that would one day
00:02:13.280 carry Roman warships into new
00:02:15.640 territories began with two helpless
00:02:18.080 infants bobbing along in a cradle made
00:02:21.120 of reeds. Eventually, the basket came to
00:02:24.720 rest near the base of a fig tree. And it
00:02:27.200 was there that one of the most famous
00:02:28.800 mothers in all mythology found them. Not
00:02:31.680 a noble woman or even a peasant, but a
00:02:35.280 sheolf. Yes, a literal sheolf. She took
00:02:39.680 the boys in, nursed them, cared for
00:02:42.800 them, and kept them alive until a
00:02:45.200 shepherd named Fouulus stumbled upon the
00:02:48.160 scene. He brought the boys home, and he
00:02:50.400 and his wife raised them as their own.
00:02:52.480 Imagine growing up being told, "Oh yes,
00:02:56.000 you were raised by wolves." No, really.
00:02:58.720 As Romulus and Remis grew older, they
00:03:01.680 became natural leaders. Strong, clever,
00:03:05.519 fiercely competitive. They also grew
00:03:08.000 curious about their true
00:03:09.720 origins. Eventually, they learned the
00:03:12.239 truth about their royal blood and
00:03:14.480 overthrew the very king who had once
00:03:16.720 tried to end them. That was just the
00:03:18.720 warm-up. Because now the twins wanted to
00:03:22.319 build something, not just a home. Not
00:03:25.519 even a village, but a city. A city for
00:03:28.879 the gods. A city for themselves. But
00:03:32.959 there was a
00:03:34.040 problem. You can't found a city together
00:03:37.040 when only one of you can be king. And in
00:03:39.440 true Roman fashion, they decided to
00:03:41.840 solve this problem the peaceful way by
00:03:45.040 watching birds. That's not a joke. In
00:03:49.120 early Roman
00:03:50.760 culture, interpreting the will of the
00:03:52.959 gods through birds was a respected
00:03:55.440 practice. Remis claimed to have seen six
00:03:58.640 vultures flying overhead. Romulus
00:04:01.599 claimed he saw 12. Somehow that math
00:04:05.360 turned into an argument and the argument
00:04:08.319 turned into a fight. In the end, Romulus
00:04:11.840 killed his brother. There are different
00:04:13.920 versions of how it happened. Some say
00:04:16.560 Reheis mocked Romulus by jumping over
00:04:19.040 the boundary wall of the new city,
00:04:21.440 showing how easily it could be breached.
00:04:24.199 Romulus, furious at the disrespect,
00:04:27.120 struck him down. Others say it was an
00:04:29.280 accident. Or maybe it wasn't Romulus at
00:04:31.600 all, but one of his followers. But the
00:04:34.160 result was the same. Remis fell. Romulus
00:04:37.120 stood and Rome was born. A city carved
00:04:41.199 out of myth, grief, ambition, and blood.
00:04:45.560 Founded, according to tradition in the
00:04:48.479 year
00:04:49.320 753 B.C.E., it wasn't much at first. A
00:04:53.600 collection of huts really. Mud walls,
00:04:56.320 wooden beams, no palaces, no marble,
00:04:59.919 just smoke curling from
00:05:01.720 chimneys and wild dogs howling in the
00:05:04.479 distance. But it was Rome, and Rome was
00:05:07.680 hungry. Romulus understood something
00:05:10.080 that many leaders would forget. A city
00:05:13.039 is nothing without people. So he
00:05:15.520 declared Rome a refuge for outcasts,
00:05:19.080 exiles, fugitives, escaped slaves,
00:05:22.800 broken men with nothing left to lose.
00:05:25.280 They came. They came by the dozens, then
00:05:28.320 by the hundreds. But there was one
00:05:30.240 problem with Romulus's new community. It
00:05:33.440 was all men. And so
00:05:36.199 Romulus, ever the
00:05:38.759 pragmatist, devised a plan. He invited
00:05:41.919 the neighboring Sabins to a great
00:05:44.639 festival. There would be food, music,
00:05:48.440 games, laughter. The Sabins came. They
00:05:52.720 brought their families, their daughters.
00:05:55.840 And then during the
00:05:57.639 festivities, the Roman men took the
00:06:00.560 women. Some say it was brutal. Others
00:06:03.199 say it was more diplomatic. That the
00:06:05.759 women were persuaded to stay by the
00:06:07.520 promise of power, protection, and
00:06:09.440 children. who would inherit both Sabine
00:06:12.080 and Roman blood. The Sabine men, of
00:06:14.560 course, didn't take this kindly. War
00:06:17.280 broke out, but before it could spiral
00:06:19.600 too far, the Sabine women themselves
00:06:22.440 intervened. Standing between the armies,
00:06:25.520 begging their new husbands and former
00:06:27.680 fathers to stop. And somehow they
00:06:30.479 listened. From that uneasy peace came an
00:06:33.280 even stranger idea. The Sabines would
00:06:36.240 join Rome. Their king, Titus Tatius,
00:06:40.720 would rule alongside Romulus. Two kings,
00:06:44.160 one city. It worked for a while until
00:06:47.440 Tatius was murdered in a suspicious
00:06:49.880 ambush. Romulus ruled alone again. He
00:06:53.199 reigned for decades, growing more
00:06:55.560 distant, more godlike. Some say he
00:06:58.720 vanished in a thunderstorm, taken up to
00:07:01.919 the heavens by Mars. his father. Others
00:07:05.680 whispered that the Senate killed him and
00:07:08.400 covered it up with divine drama. But
00:07:11.120 however he left, Romulus became a
00:07:14.280 legend. And Rome had begun. After
00:07:17.120 Romulus came six more kings, each
00:07:20.400 building upon the last, there was Numa
00:07:23.560 Pompilus, the peaceful philosopher king
00:07:26.880 who taught Rome how to pray. He built
00:07:29.800 temples, established sacred rituals, and
00:07:33.440 told the people that not everything had
00:07:35.840 to be solved with a sword. Then came
00:07:38.680 Talis
00:07:40.280 Hostilius, who promptly did the
00:07:42.240 opposite. He relished war, conquering
00:07:45.680 Alba Longa, the city where Romulus's
00:07:48.639 grandfather had once ruled under his
00:07:51.000 watch. The famous jewel between the
00:07:53.599 Hereti and the Curati took place. Three
00:07:57.280 Roman brothers versus three Alban ones.
00:08:00.080 Fighting to decide the fate of two
00:08:02.000 cities in single combat. It was meant to
00:08:04.400 avoid fullscale war. It didn't. Talis
00:08:07.599 died, they say. Struck by lightning
00:08:11.520 after performing a sacred right
00:08:13.280 incorrectly. The gods apparently were
00:08:15.440 not amused. Then came Ankus
00:08:18.520 Marcus, part warrior, part priest, part
00:08:22.720 builder. He founded Austia, Rome's first
00:08:27.000 port, and started bridging the river
00:08:30.160 that once carried Romulus and Remis to
00:08:32.640 safety. The Tyber had watched them float
00:08:35.120 by as infants. Now, under Ankus' rule,
00:08:39.120 it was becoming a highway for trade and
00:08:41.559 expansion. But the next king would
00:08:44.320 change everything, and his name was
00:08:47.279 Tarunius Prriscus. Tarquunius Prriscus
00:08:51.120 wasn't born Roman. He was at Truscan
00:08:54.880 from a land to the north where city
00:08:57.560 states shimmered with bronze mirrors and
00:09:01.120 painted tombs and the quiet wealth of
00:09:04.240 old culture. He had the kind of
00:09:06.320 sophistication that Romans still
00:09:09.040 emerging from their muddy huts looked at
00:09:12.080 with awe and suspicion. His real name
00:09:15.040 was Lucumo, but he changed it when he
00:09:17.839 moved to Rome with his ambitious wife,
00:09:20.399 Tanacquil. Tanquil was the real deal.
00:09:24.240 Sharp, mystical, political. She read
00:09:27.680 omens in the flight of birds and the
00:09:29.519 shimmer of flames. Legend says that as
00:09:32.560 they entered Rome, an eagle swooped down
00:09:35.519 and plucked Tarquin's cap from his head,
00:09:38.560 only to gently return it. Tanacquil saw
00:09:41.279 this as a sign. Her husband was destined
00:09:44.240 for greatness. And so he was through
00:09:47.360 clever speeches, bribes, and sheer
00:09:50.760 charisma. Tarwin became king. He ruled
00:09:54.080 with vision where others built
00:09:57.000 huts. He built monuments. He
00:10:00.000 commissioned the circus
00:10:01.720 Maximus, a vast chariot racing track
00:10:05.760 that could hold tens of thousands. And
00:10:08.560 if you close your eyes, you can almost
00:10:11.279 hear it. The thunder of hooves, the
00:10:14.720 cheers of the crowd, the sharp crack of
00:10:17.440 the whip as horses tore down the track
00:10:20.959 in a blur of dust and glory. Tarquin
00:10:24.399 also began the cloa maxima, a massive
00:10:27.600 drainage system that turned Rome's
00:10:30.240 swampy lowlands into usable land. It
00:10:33.760 doesn't sound glamorous, but that sewer
00:10:36.399 helped shape the Roman forum, the heart
00:10:39.040 of Roman life for centuries. Sometimes
00:10:41.600 empires are built not on swords but on
00:10:44.959 drains. And he brought Atruscan culture
00:10:47.440 with him. Arches,
00:10:49.959 engineering, ory, Roman religion, art.
00:10:54.560 Even their alphabet bore Atruscan
00:10:57.079 fingerprints. In a way, this foreign
00:10:59.600 king made Rome more Roman than ever
00:11:01.519 before. But power is rarely handed down
00:11:04.640 peacefully. When Tarquin was
00:11:07.240 assassinated, stabbed by the sons of a
00:11:09.680 former king during a political spat that
00:11:13.040 felt more like a mafia coup, his wife,
00:11:16.320 the ever clever Tanacquil, didn't panic.
00:11:19.519 Instead, she told the people that the
00:11:21.839 king wasn't dead, just wounded. And
00:11:24.959 while he recovered, a young man named
00:11:27.440 Servius Tilious would act as regent. By
00:11:31.040 the time they figured out, Tarkin was
00:11:33.040 very much dead. Servius had already
00:11:35.600 taken control. Servius Tilus is one of
00:11:38.480 the more mysterious figures in early
00:11:40.399 Roman history. According to some
00:11:43.640 stories, he was born a slave. Others say
00:11:46.880 he had divine origins. One version
00:11:49.440 claims his head caught fire as a child,
00:11:52.399 but he wasn't burned.
00:11:54.360 Tanacquil seeing this as another omen
00:11:57.200 raised him in the royal household like a
00:11:59.279 second son. Whether or not his scalp
00:12:02.160 ever burst into
00:12:03.720 flame, Servius did burn with reform. He
00:12:07.200 reorganized Roman society, dividing
00:12:10.240 citizens not by tribe or bloodline, but
00:12:13.519 by wealth and military capability. This
00:12:16.560 became the Servian Constitution, and it
00:12:19.519 laid the groundwork for the Roman
00:12:21.200 Republic. If you could afford a sword
00:12:23.279 and a shield, you got a say. Not a bad
00:12:27.279 motivator for joining the army. He also
00:12:30.000 built a wall. Not metaphorically, an
00:12:33.040 actual wall. The Servian wall encircled
00:12:36.720 the city with stone and seriousness.
00:12:39.839 Rome was no longer a loose collection of
00:12:42.160 huts and egos. It was becoming something
00:12:45.200 permanent. But permanence is fragile.
00:12:48.240 Especially when your successor wants
00:12:49.839 your crown and your daughter. Enter
00:12:52.720 Tarquinius Superbus, Tarquin the proud,
00:12:56.320 son or grandson of the earlier Tarquin,
00:13:00.320 depending on who you ask, and husband of
00:13:02.959 Servius Tullius's ambitious daughter.
00:13:05.560 Together, they made quite the power
00:13:07.920 couple, the kind that smiles at
00:13:10.200 banquetss while quietly sharpening the
00:13:12.560 knives. Tarquinius didn't wait for
00:13:14.959 Servius to die of old age. He had him
00:13:18.160 thrown down the Senate steps where his
00:13:20.639 blood soaked the stones. Then he
00:13:23.279 declared himself king. He ruled with
00:13:26.839 fear. No more fake smiles or augury
00:13:30.600 rituals. He used executions and
00:13:33.320 intimidation to keep the nobles in line.
00:13:36.320 He silenced dissent. He ignored
00:13:39.360 tradition, but he also got things done.
00:13:42.480 He completed the temple of Jupiter,
00:13:45.200 Optimus Maximus on the capitaline hill,
00:13:48.959 the most important temple in Rome,
00:13:51.600 towering over the forum like a marble
00:13:54.240 thundercloud. He went to war with
00:13:56.320 neighboring cities and expanded Roman
00:13:59.279 territory. And he continued Rome's long
00:14:01.839 tradition of mixing terror with triumph.
00:14:04.959 But every tyrant eventually pushes too
00:14:07.920 far. The breaking point came not on the
00:14:10.480 battlefield but in a home in the private
00:14:13.360 tragedy of a woman named Lucriccia.
00:14:16.320 According to the tale, Tarquin's son,
00:14:19.880 Sexus, assaulted Lucriccia, the wife of
00:14:23.440 a nobleman named Colatinus, devastated
00:14:26.639 by shame and dishonor, she gathered her
00:14:29.639 family, told them what had happened, and
00:14:32.959 took her own life. Her blood ignited a
00:14:35.600 fire that no king could smother. One of
00:14:38.240 those listening was Lucius Junius
00:14:41.480 Brutus, a name that would echo through
00:14:44.360 history centuries later in the halls of
00:14:47.360 the Senate. But this Brutus wasn't quiet
00:14:50.079 or hesitant. He held up Lucriccia's
00:14:52.760 dagger, vowed to drive out the Tarquins
00:14:56.240 and declared the end of kingship in
00:14:58.320 Rome. And just like that, or so the
00:15:01.120 legend says, the monarchy was over. Rome
00:15:04.399 would never have another king.
00:15:06.839 Instead, it would have consoles, two
00:15:10.639 elected leaders sharing power, checking
00:15:14.240 each other. A republic was born. This
00:15:17.040 wasn't democracy the way we think of it
00:15:19.760 today. The votes of the wealthy counted
00:15:22.480 more than the votes of the poor. Women
00:15:25.519 had no voice. The slaves were
00:15:29.160 slaves, but it was new. It was Roman and
00:15:32.560 it would last in one form or another.
00:15:35.839 For nearly 500 years, in those early
00:15:39.000 days, the republic was shaky. There were
00:15:42.320 enemies everywhere, from within and
00:15:45.360 without. But Rome did what it always did
00:15:48.000 when under pressure. It adapted. The
00:15:51.440 early republic built its strength on
00:15:54.079 alliances and war, lots of war. The
00:15:56.959 Latin League, a collection of nearby
00:15:59.839 cities, tried to resist Roman power.
00:16:02.320 They failed. The Atruscans, once
00:16:05.360 cultural mentors, now feared Roman
00:16:07.560 expansion. They fought, they lost. Even
00:16:10.800 the fierce Sam knights, warriors from
00:16:13.040 the rugged central mountains, battled
00:16:15.759 Rome across three brutal wars. But the
00:16:18.639 real test came when a strange new enemy
00:16:22.000 appeared from across the sea. The
00:16:25.279 Greeks, not all the Greeks, just the
00:16:28.000 ones in southern Italy. These were
00:16:30.000 wealthy citystates with marble columns,
00:16:34.519 finan expensive armor. When Rome
00:16:37.279 threatened one of their cities, they
00:16:39.759 called for help from a man known as Pyus
00:16:42.160 of Eperis. Pius was a cousin of
00:16:44.639 Alexander the Great, and he fancied
00:16:47.199 himself cut from the same cloth, or at
00:16:49.759 least the same breastplate. He brought
00:16:51.759 elephants across the sea. War elephants
00:16:55.680 stomping through Italy like walking
00:16:57.839 siege towers. The battles were fierce.
00:17:01.360 Rome lost thousands, but so did
00:17:04.119 Pius. After one particularly devastating
00:17:07.400 victory, he sets to have remarked,
00:17:10.480 "Another such victory." And I am undone.
00:17:14.000 That's where we get the term pirick
00:17:16.039 victory. Winning at such a cost that it
00:17:19.359 might as well be a loss. Eventually,
00:17:21.919 Pyus withdrew.
00:17:24.000 He said the Romans were like a hydra cut
00:17:27.039 off one head and two more popped up
00:17:30.480 fully armored asking for another round.
00:17:33.760 Rome now controlled all of Italy. And it
00:17:37.039 was only just getting started. To the
00:17:39.559 south across the sparkling blue waters
00:17:43.679 lay a city unlike any other. Carthage,
00:17:47.280 rich, ancient, cunning. Its harbors
00:17:51.200 buzzed with trade. Its generals trained
00:17:53.919 in silence, its leaders watched Rome
00:17:56.240 with curiosity and unease. The two
00:17:59.360 cities had been allies once, trading
00:18:02.760 treaties and polite threats. But with
00:18:05.679 Rome expanding and Carthage guarding its
00:18:09.120 interests in Sicily, it was only a
00:18:11.840 matter of time before they clashed. That
00:18:14.880 time had come and the wars that followed
00:18:17.360 would shape the destiny of both
00:18:19.559 civilizations and unleash one of the
00:18:21.840 greatest military minds the world had
00:18:23.679 ever seen. But before we meet him, we
00:18:26.480 have to go to Sicily and watch the spark
00:18:29.440 that would become the first Punic War.
00:18:31.840 Sicily was a jewel, fertile, sun soaked,
00:18:37.039 and perfectly placed between the toe of
00:18:39.600 Italy and the edge of Africa. Whoever
00:18:42.720 controlled Sicily controlled the sea,
00:18:46.320 and both Rome and Carthage wanted it.
00:18:49.840 The trouble started, as it often did,
00:18:53.440 with a third party, a group of
00:18:55.480 mercenaries known as the Mammatines, had
00:18:58.559 seized a city called Masana and asked
00:19:01.440 both Carthage and Rome for help.
00:19:03.840 Naturally, both powers said yes. And
00:19:06.880 when two armies showed up to help, the
00:19:09.520 dance was over. This was war. The first
00:19:13.200 Punic War began in 264 B.CE. And it was
00:19:18.559 unlike anything Rome had ever fought.
00:19:20.720 Rome was a land power. It had legions,
00:19:24.000 discipline, roads. But Carthage ruled
00:19:26.960 the sea. So Rome, in classic Roman
00:19:30.280 fashion, said, "Let sets build a navy."
00:19:34.880 And they did from scratch.
00:19:37.840 According to legend, they found a
00:19:39.919 wrecked Carthaginian ship, copied the
00:19:42.720 design, and began churning out vessels
00:19:45.679 like it was an assembly line. They even
00:19:47.840 added a secret weapon, the Corvvis, a
00:19:51.120 boarding bridge with a massive spike. It
00:19:53.919 turned sea battles into land battles.
00:19:56.640 Now the Romans could do what they did
00:19:58.480 best, stab people up close. The war
00:20:01.760 dragged on for 23 years. a grueling,
00:20:06.840 expensive, back andforth brawl of ships,
00:20:10.799 sieges, and setbacks. Rome would win a
00:20:13.880 battle only to lose its fleet to a
00:20:17.120 storm. Carthage would rally only to be
00:20:20.080 betrayed by its own mercenaries.
00:20:23.080 Eventually, after a major Roman naval
00:20:25.760 victory at the Battle of the Agates
00:20:27.640 Islands, Carthage sued for peace. Rome
00:20:31.600 had won. Carthage was forced to pay
00:20:34.120 tribute, abandon Sicily, and nurse its
00:20:37.600 wounds in silence. But in that silence,
00:20:41.280 something was growing. A boy, a boy who
00:20:44.640 had watched his father, Hamlcar Barker,
00:20:48.640 return home bitter and beaten. A boy who
00:20:52.159 was said to have sworn an oath at just 9
00:20:54.400 years old, placing his small hand in his
00:20:57.280 father's and vowing eternal hatred for
00:21:00.159 Rome. His name was Hannibal. Sets pause
00:21:04.000 for a second. If you're still with us,
00:21:07.760 maybe you've shifted a little under the
00:21:09.400 covers or your eyes are heavier than
00:21:11.919 before. That's all right. Let the voice
00:21:14.799 wash over you. The story continues.
00:21:18.039 Soft, steady, relentless, just like the
00:21:22.000 march Hannibal would one day begin.
00:21:24.400 Hamlar took his son and his army to
00:21:27.159 Spain, a wild fractured land of tribes
00:21:31.200 and silver mines and opportunity. There
00:21:35.039 the Barid family built their own empire.
00:21:37.679 When Hamlar died, supposedly drowned in
00:21:40.799 battle while Hannibal watched his
00:21:43.200 son-in-law Hazdrul took over. And when
00:21:45.840 Hazdrul was
00:21:47.320 assassinated, it was Hannibal's turn. By
00:21:50.440 25 he was in charge of the Carthaginian
00:21:53.360 forces in Iberia and almost immediately
00:21:56.640 he picked a fight. The city of
00:21:59.640 Sagunum. A Roman ally fell to Hannibal
00:22:03.200 in 219 B.CE. Rome issued demands.
00:22:07.520 Carthage
00:22:08.679 refused. And so began the second Punic
00:22:11.760 War. But this one this one was different
00:22:15.360 because Hannibal wasn't going to fight
00:22:17.039 in Spain. He wasn't even going to fight
00:22:19.360 in Africa. He was going to take the war
00:22:21.679 to Rome and he was going to walk with an
00:22:24.799 army of infantry, cavalry, and most
00:22:28.679 famously elephants. Hannibal crossed the
00:22:31.640 Pyrenees. Then the Alps in one of the
00:22:34.000 most insane military maneuvers in
00:22:36.320 ancient history. Snow blinded the
00:22:39.159 troops. Avalanches crushed supply lines.
00:22:42.480 Men froze. Elephants fell from icy
00:22:45.600 cliffs. But somehow, somehow, Hannibal
00:22:49.440 made it through. He descended into Italy
00:22:52.960 like a ghost. And then the killing
00:22:55.360 began. At the Battle of Tribia, he
00:22:58.480 baited the Romans into a trap and
00:23:00.720 destroyed them. At Lake Trasamon, he
00:23:03.679 used fog and the terrain to ambush
00:23:06.000 another Roman force. Over 15,000 dead,
00:23:09.679 the Romans began to panic. Cities
00:23:12.000 defected. Senators debated fleeing. So
00:23:15.360 Rome appointed a
00:23:16.840 dictator, Fabius Maximus, whose strategy
00:23:20.480 was not to fight. Instead, he harassed
00:23:24.480 Hannibal's supply lines, avoided open
00:23:27.480 battle, and kept his distance. The
00:23:30.159 people hated it. They called him Conct
00:23:34.640 the Delair. But it
00:23:36.600 worked. Sort of. Hannibal couldn't
00:23:39.600 strike a fatal blow, but he hadn't come
00:23:41.919 this far for a war of waiting. Then
00:23:45.799 came. It was 216
00:23:49.000 B.CE. The largest Roman army ever
00:23:52.039 assembled. Nearly 80,000 men marched to
00:23:55.440 crush Hannibal once and for all.
00:23:57.919 Hannibal faced them with half the
00:24:00.000 numbers. But he knew how Romans fought.
00:24:03.280 Straight, direct, relentless. So he
00:24:06.960 arranged his troops in a crescent
00:24:09.360 formation with his weakest men in the
00:24:11.600 center and his strongest on the flanks.
00:24:14.320 As expected, the Romans charged straight
00:24:16.640 into the middle, pushing forward deeper
00:24:20.159 and deeper, too deep because that
00:24:23.120 crescent folded back. And then the
00:24:25.200 Carthaginian cavalry, having routed the
00:24:28.240 Roman horsemen, circled behind the Roman
00:24:32.240 army, was surrounded. It wasn't boasted
00:24:35.440 a battle. It was a slaughter. Estimates
00:24:38.320 say as many as 50,000 Romans died in a
00:24:41.520 single day. It was the worst defeat in
00:24:44.320 Roman history. And yet Rome didn't
00:24:47.559 surrender. Cities defected to Hannibal.
00:24:50.640 Allies abandoned the republic. But the
00:24:53.279 city of Rome itself did not fall. Even
00:24:56.720 as Hannibal camped outside its gates,
00:24:59.919 Rome refused to open them. Why didn't
00:25:02.480 instead Hannibal attack the city? Maybe
00:25:05.120 his army was too tired. Maybe he lacked
00:25:08.400 siege equipment. Or maybe, just maybe,
00:25:11.919 he didn't want to destroy Rome. He
00:25:14.000 wanted it to admit defeat. But Rome
00:25:16.640 never did. Instead, it regrouped,
00:25:20.600 rebuilt, retaliated under new generals
00:25:24.080 like Marcus Claudius
00:25:25.799 Marcellus, known as the sword of Rome
00:25:29.039 and a young, ambitious commander named
00:25:31.919 Publius Cornelius Cypio. Rome began to
00:25:35.200 turn the tide. Cypio was brilliant,
00:25:39.039 charming, strategic, patient. He studied
00:25:43.039 Hannibal's
00:25:44.279 tactics, learned from them, and then
00:25:47.440 instead of chasing Hannibal through
00:25:49.240 Italy, he attacked Carthaginian holdings
00:25:52.400 in Spain. City by city, he pushed the
00:25:56.159 Barcid family out. He captured New
00:25:59.799 Carthage, defeated Hannibal's brother,
00:26:03.559 Hasdrubel. And then he did something
00:26:06.240 bold. He invaded North Africa with
00:26:09.200 Carthage itself now threatened. Hannibal
00:26:12.159 was recalled from Italy after nearly 15
00:26:14.960 years of campaigning. The final clash
00:26:17.520 came at the battle of Zarma in 202 B.CE.
00:26:22.159 It was a reversal of Canaan. This time
00:26:26.159 it was Cypio who used Hannibal's own
00:26:28.559 tactics against him. The Roman cavalry
00:26:31.440 outflanked the Carthaginians. The
00:26:33.520 elephants panicked and Hannibal for the
00:26:36.320 first and only time was decisively
00:26:39.039 defeated. He survived, retired,
00:26:42.960 wandered, became a political
00:26:45.720 adviser. But Rome never forgot him.
00:26:48.559 Years later, when he was pursued by
00:26:50.880 Roman agents, Hannibal chose to take
00:26:53.799 poison rather than be captured. His last
00:26:56.880 words reportedly, "Let us relieve the
00:26:59.919 Romans of their fears by the death of a
00:27:02.400 feeble old man." Hannibal was gone. Rome
00:27:05.520 was victorious. And with Carthage
00:27:08.520 humbled, Rome now ruled the western
00:27:11.400 Mediterranean. But victory brought more
00:27:13.600 than power. It brought ambition, greed,
00:27:17.520 corruption, and trouble was brewing back
00:27:20.000 in the city. Because while Rome fought
00:27:23.240 Carthage, something else was growing
00:27:25.360 inside its borders. A widening gap
00:27:28.320 between rich and poor. Veterans returned
00:27:31.600 home to find their farms sold, their
00:27:34.400 families displaced, wealth flooded into
00:27:37.279 the hands of a few, and the Republic,
00:27:40.840 proud, noble,
00:27:43.320 idealistic, began to crack. But before
00:27:46.159 we talk about that fall, we'll journey
00:27:48.799 into the next great expansion eastward
00:27:52.000 into Greece, Macedonia, and beyond. Rome
00:27:55.679 had tasted empire, and it wanted more.
00:27:59.279 Rome had conquered the
00:28:01.080 west. Now it turned its gaze east to the
00:28:04.720 ancient lands of philosophy, wealth, and
00:28:07.399 kingdoms, where marble temples rose from
00:28:10.240 hills like white sails catching the sun.
00:28:13.720 Greece, Macedonia, Asia Minor. These
00:28:17.200 weren't muddy hill tribes or wild
00:28:19.279 horsemen. These were the descendants of
00:28:21.440 Alexander the Great. But Rome didn't
00:28:23.840 flinch. It had learned from Carthage. It
00:28:27.120 was stronger now.
00:28:29.200 Hungria. The wars in the east began
00:28:32.080 under the pretext of helping allies,
00:28:34.559 always
00:28:36.039 helping. That was the Roman way. First
00:28:38.799 it was against Philip Fifer Macedon, a
00:28:42.080 proud king with a famous name but fewer
00:28:44.720 troops than his father had once
00:28:46.559 commanded. Then Antious III of the
00:28:49.120 Seucid Empire who dreamed of restoring
00:28:52.080 Alexander's vast dominion. He had
00:28:54.480 elephants too, like Hannibal and dreams
00:28:58.080 to match. But dreams don't stop legions.
00:29:01.440 And then there was
00:29:02.840 Perseus, the last Macedonian king to
00:29:05.679 defy Rome. He fought bravely, fielding
00:29:08.880 his falanks against Rome's more flexible
00:29:11.559 formations. But it wasn't enough. The
00:29:14.720 battle of Pidner in 168 B.C.E. ended it.
00:29:19.520 Rome dismantled Macedon, broke it into
00:29:22.240 four puppet states, and began plundering
00:29:25.200 Greek heart like children let loose in a
00:29:27.600 treasure room. Statues, scrolls,
00:29:30.200 teachers, all brought home. Greek tutors
00:29:33.360 began raising Roman sons. Greek plays
00:29:36.559 were performed in Roman theaters. And
00:29:39.279 yet to the Romans, the Greeks were still
00:29:41.520 foreigners.
00:29:43.200 Brilliant but soft, artistic but
00:29:47.320 undisiplined. The Romans admired them
00:29:49.919 and mocked them at the same time. It's
00:29:53.080 complicated. When you conquer your
00:29:55.240 heroes, but all this wealth, all this
00:29:59.000 power came at a price. Rome had been a
00:30:02.480 city of
00:30:03.480 farmers. Now it was becoming something
00:30:05.840 else. Rich aristocrats bought up land
00:30:09.600 creating vast estates called latifundia.
00:30:12.559 Worked by slaves taken from every new
00:30:15.320 conquest. Small farmers couldn't
00:30:17.600 compete. They moved to the city hoping
00:30:20.559 for work only to find their labor
00:30:23.399 devalued and their pride slipping away.
00:30:26.559 It was around this time in the middle of
00:30:28.880 the 2n century B.C.E. the two brothers
00:30:32.240 stepped forward to try and fix things.
00:30:34.960 The Greki, Tiberius and Gaas Graas were
00:30:39.039 noble men by birth, but reformers by
00:30:41.919 conviction. Tiberius the Elder proposed
00:30:45.279 giving public land back to the poor. A
00:30:48.399 radical idea the Senate was not amused
00:30:51.360 when Tiberius tried to run for a second
00:30:53.679 term as tribune. A mob of senators and
00:30:57.120 their clients beat him to death in the
00:30:59.520 forum. No trial, no hesitation, just
00:31:02.640 blood in the streets. Years later, Gaes
00:31:06.159 tried again. He expanded his brother's
00:31:08.600 ideas, offering grain subsidies, new
00:31:12.039 colonies, even citizenship for Rome's
00:31:14.799 Italian allies. But he too met
00:31:17.080 resistance. Cornered on a hill with his
00:31:19.720 supporters, he ordered his own slave to
00:31:22.320 take his life rather than be captured.
00:31:24.559 His body was thrown into the Tyber where
00:31:27.279 it floated like a broken promise. And
00:31:30.480 still Rome carried on. More wars
00:31:33.039 followed. Numidia, Gaul, Spain again.
00:31:36.640 But cracks were spreading. The legions
00:31:38.799 themselves were changing. No longer were
00:31:41.279 they citizen soldiers defending their
00:31:43.600 land. Now more and more they were poor
00:31:46.720 men promised land and spoils by
00:31:49.840 ambitious generals. Loyalty shifted from
00:31:53.360 the Republic to the commander. It was
00:31:55.919 subtle at first, but like all fault
00:31:58.440 lines, it only needed time. Enter Gaas
00:32:02.440 Marius, a commoner who rose through
00:32:04.960 military success. He reformed the army,
00:32:08.399 opening enlistment to the landless poor.
00:32:11.120 It was revolutionary. He trained them,
00:32:14.240 armed them, made them into
00:32:16.080 professionals, and they loved him for
00:32:18.000 it. Marius became a hero, a six-time
00:32:21.039 console, a symbol of the new Rome. But
00:32:23.919 every hero needs a rival. And for
00:32:26.320 Marius, that rival was Lucius Cornelius
00:32:30.320 Sila. Sula was from the old elite, cold,
00:32:34.760 ruthless, brilliant. When a dispute
00:32:37.360 arose over command of a war in the east,
00:32:40.240 Marius and Sula clashed, not just in
00:32:43.080 speeches, with swords. Silla did the
00:32:46.240 unthinkable. He marched his army into
00:32:48.519 Rome. Imagine it. Legions in the
00:32:51.799 streets, citizens locking their doors,
00:32:55.200 senators scattering like pigeons. Rome
00:32:58.080 had seen invasion before, but this was
00:33:00.399 its own army. This was civil war. Marius
00:33:04.840 fled. Sah left for the east to fight
00:33:07.840 King Mithrates. But while he was gone,
00:33:10.720 Marius
00:33:11.799 returned, older, angrier, and more
00:33:15.120 brutal than before. He seized control
00:33:17.760 and purged his enemies. The streets ran
00:33:20.880 red, but Marius, now exhausted, died
00:33:24.480 shortly after. When Sila came back, he
00:33:27.679 didn't set forgive. He became dictator,
00:33:31.120 not for 6 months, as tradition allowed,
00:33:34.720 but indefinitely. He posted lists,
00:33:38.440 prescriptions, naming enemies of the
00:33:40.640 state. Kill them, and you'd be rewarded.
00:33:43.519 Old rivals, wealthy
00:33:46.200 citizens, even former friends. It was
00:33:49.519 open season and yet Sullah did something
00:33:53.159 strange. After reshaping the republic to
00:33:56.159 favor the Senate and crushing
00:33:58.840 opposition, he stepped down, retired,
00:34:02.080 died quietly in his villa. A final
00:34:04.480 gesture of control, even over his own
00:34:07.279 exit. But Rome had changed. Something
00:34:10.320 fundamental had broken. And while Sula
00:34:12.960 may have left the stage, others were
00:34:15.599 waiting in the wings. One of them had
00:34:17.839 already begun his rise. A teenager who
00:34:21.040 watched Sullah's rise and fall with
00:34:22.879 quiet calculation. His name Garius
00:34:26.399 Julius Caesar. And it's with him that
00:34:29.359 the republic will never be the same
00:34:31.040 again. Julius Caesar wasn't born a
00:34:33.760 conqueror. He was born into
00:34:36.199 chaos. When Sullah was dictator, Caesar
00:34:39.839 was a young noble from a less powerful
00:34:42.320 branch of a once great family. the
00:34:45.280 Julians. His aunt had married Marius,
00:34:48.399 the now dead rival of Silah. That made
00:34:50.719 Caesar suspect and dangerous. Sila
00:34:54.239 ordered him to divorce his wife,
00:34:56.839 Cornelia, daughter of one of Marius's
00:34:59.280 allies. Caesar refused. He was only a
00:35:02.720 teenager, but already stubborn. He fled
00:35:05.680 Rome, went into hiding, and only
00:35:08.640 returned when Silla reluctantly pardoned
00:35:10.880 him, muttering, according to legend,
00:35:13.680 that in Caesar there are many Mariuses.
00:35:16.560 It wasn't sit compliment, but Caesar was
00:35:20.839 patient. He started small, military
00:35:23.839 service in Asia, captured by pirates on
00:35:26.320 the way. The story goes that the pirates
00:35:28.640 demanded 20 talants of silver for
00:35:30.800 ransom. Caesar laughed and insisted they
00:35:33.920 ask for 50. Because he was worth more,
00:35:37.440 he joked with them, read poetry to them,
00:35:40.240 promised he'd return, and have them
00:35:42.400 crucified. And after he was freed, he
00:35:45.200 did exactly that. Back in Rome, Caesar
00:35:48.160 climbed the political ladder with a
00:35:50.320 mixture of charm, debt, and dazzling
00:35:53.200 oratory. He was handsome,
00:35:56.040 eloquent, deeply ambitious, and famously
00:35:59.720 generous, especially with other people's
00:36:02.000 money. He borrowed constantly to fund
00:36:04.720 games, banquetss, and favors. The people
00:36:08.400 loved him. The Senate didn't. To move
00:36:11.800 forward, Caesar needed allies. And so,
00:36:15.280 he forged a secret alliance with two
00:36:17.760 men. Craus, the wealthiest man in Rome,
00:36:21.760 and Pompy, the republic's most
00:36:23.680 celebrated general. Together, they
00:36:26.160 formed what modern historians call the
00:36:29.040 first
00:36:29.960 triumphvirate, a power sharing deal that
00:36:33.359 bypassed the traditional rules. Cassus
00:36:36.880 brought money. Pompy brought
00:36:39.240 armies. Caesar brought the people. In 59
00:36:43.960 B.CE, Caesar became consul. He pushed
00:36:47.440 laws
00:36:48.520 aggressively, sometimes using mob
00:36:50.760 pressure and ignoring Senate procedure.
00:36:53.839 His enemies called it illegal. Caesar
00:36:56.960 called it necessary. After his term, he
00:36:59.920 was given governorship over Gaul.
00:37:03.119 Modernday France, it was supposed to be
00:37:05.520 a stepping stone. It became a legend.
00:37:09.359 Gaul was wild, tribal, proud.
00:37:13.400 Caesar over the next eight years would
00:37:16.480 conquer it. All of it. He fought dozens
00:37:19.200 of tribes, crossed rivers, scaled
00:37:22.359 mountains, even invaded Britain, a misty
00:37:25.520 land few Romans had seen. His
00:37:27.520 commentaries on the GIC wars were
00:37:29.839 written in crisp, clear pros, part
00:37:32.880 report, part propaganda. He portrayed
00:37:35.359 himself as calm, rational, the
00:37:38.400 embodiment of Roman order against
00:37:40.320 barbarian chaos. the
00:37:42.760 truth. Blood ran like wine. One siege of
00:37:47.000 Helissia killed tens of thousands. But
00:37:50.480 to Rome, he was a hero rich in spoils,
00:37:55.119 beloved by soldiers, dangerous to his
00:37:57.920 enemies. Meanwhile, the alliance at home
00:38:01.119 was unraveling. Craus died in a failed
00:38:04.280 campaign against the
00:38:06.359 Paththeians, captured, executed, and
00:38:10.320 according to some had molten gold poured
00:38:13.119 down his throat in mockery of his greed.
00:38:16.680 Pompy once Caesar's son-in-law through
00:38:19.920 marriage to Julia, now turned against
00:38:22.720 him. Julia died in childbirth. The bond
00:38:25.760 between them broke. The Senate, nervous
00:38:28.720 of Caesar's growing power, sided with
00:38:31.920 Pompy, and then came the ultimatum.
00:38:35.119 Caesar was ordered to disband his army
00:38:38.079 and return to Rome alone. The law
00:38:41.040 demanded it, but Caesar knew the moment
00:38:43.440 he stepped back into Rome without his
00:38:46.280 legions, he'd be arrested, tried, and
00:38:49.920 exiled, or worse. So, he made a choice.
00:38:53.359 In 49 B.CE, CE he crossed the Rubicon
00:38:56.720 River, the boundary into Italy with his
00:38:59.680 army. It was treason. It was civil war.
00:39:02.800 And according to the tale as he marched,
00:39:05.920 he muttered the
00:39:07.560 words the actor eston the die is cast.
00:39:12.280 Pompy fled
00:39:14.200 Rome. The Senate fled with him. Caesar
00:39:17.520 didn't pause. He marched through Italy.
00:39:21.280 Welcomed by cities, cheered by citizens,
00:39:25.280 no one resisted. He took Rome without a
00:39:27.920 fight. The war that followed was long
00:39:30.800 and winding. Pompy regrouped in Greece.
00:39:34.480 Caesar followed at the battle of
00:39:36.560 Farcelus in 48 B.CE. The two former
00:39:40.160 allies met face to face. Caesar's forces
00:39:43.119 were outnumbered, tired, hungry, but he
00:39:46.800 knew his men. He trusted them. And he
00:39:50.000 won. Pompy fled to Egypt, hoping for
00:39:53.599 sanctuary. Instead, he was betrayed,
00:39:56.560 beheaded on arrival. When Caesar came
00:39:58.960 ashore days later, they presented him
00:40:01.680 with Pompy's head in a jar. Caesar
00:40:04.000 turned away. He wept. Whatever their
00:40:07.440 rivalry, Pompy had been a Roman, a
00:40:10.359 consul, a friend. In Egypt, Caesar
00:40:14.320 became entangled in a different kind of
00:40:16.320 war, a dynastic one between the young
00:40:18.720 queen
00:40:19.560 Cleopatra and her brother. Caesar sided
00:40:22.560 with Cleopatra, and as history tends to
00:40:25.359 remind us, he didn't just support her
00:40:27.920 politically. Cleopatra was intelligent,
00:40:31.320 witty, fluent in many languages, and
00:40:34.480 carried herself like a goddess. Caesar
00:40:36.880 was captivated. Together they fought her
00:40:39.760 brother, secured her throne, and drifted
00:40:42.880 down the Nile in a golden barge like
00:40:44.960 gods in a dream. She gave him a son,
00:40:49.079 Caesarian. But Rome was calling. Back in
00:40:52.400 the city, Caesar was consolidating
00:40:55.440 power. He defeated the last of Pompy's
00:40:58.599 supporters, even chasing them to Africa
00:41:01.280 and Spain. He was declared dictator,
00:41:04.240 then dictator for 10 years, then
00:41:06.720 dictator for life. He reformed the
00:41:09.800 calendar, giving us the
00:41:12.280 365day structure we still use today. And
00:41:15.760 the month of July, named after himself.
00:41:18.640 He passed debt relief laws, expanded the
00:41:21.440 Senate, planned public works,
00:41:24.599 libraries, even a codification of Roman
00:41:27.359 law. But for all his achievements, the
00:41:30.160 whisper of kingship lingered. Romans
00:41:32.880 hated kings. That was the one red line
00:41:36.400 Caesar denied he wanted the crown. He
00:41:38.960 refused it when offered in public,
00:41:41.280 though perhaps not as forcefully as he
00:41:44.560 might have. Coins began to bear his
00:41:47.240 face. Statues of him appeared in
00:41:50.000 temples. His seat was raised higher than
00:41:52.480 the rest in the Senate, and in shadows,
00:41:55.599 a group of senators began to whisper.
00:41:58.400 They called themselves the
00:42:00.599 liberators. Brutus, Casius, Desimus, men
00:42:05.599 who had once fought alongside Caesar,
00:42:08.960 dined with him, sworn oaths. They
00:42:12.119 believed or convinced themselves they
00:42:15.359 were saving the republic. On the eyides
00:42:17.680 of March, 44 B.CE.
00:42:20.200 CE Caesar entered the Senate chamber
00:42:23.280 unarmed. As he sat down, the attack
00:42:26.240 began. Knives flashed. He fought back at
00:42:29.800 first until he saw Brutus among them.
00:42:33.280 His friend, his pretending to legend, he
00:42:37.800 said, "Etu, Brute, you too, Brutus." And
00:42:43.119 then he fell. 23 stab
00:42:45.960 wounds, blood on marble.
00:42:49.160 silence. The conspirators expected
00:42:52.760 cheers. Liberation
00:42:55.319 instead chaos. Caesar was dead. But the
00:43:00.079 republic did not return. It crumbled.
00:43:03.200 The Senate floor was wet with Caesar's
00:43:05.760 blood. Outside, the streets were tense.
00:43:09.520 The conspirators, Brutus, Casius, and
00:43:12.880 their allies, thought they had saved the
00:43:15.359 republic, but they had killed its most
00:43:17.920 powerful figure without a plan for what
00:43:20.720 came next. They marched through the
00:43:22.960 streets, declaring liberty restored. But
00:43:26.000 the people weren't celebrating. They
00:43:28.760 mourned. To them, Caesar wasn't just a
00:43:31.680 general or a dictator. He was the man
00:43:34.560 who gave them bread, cancelled debts,
00:43:38.000 threw games, gave hope. They remembered
00:43:40.960 his generosity, not his ambition. At his
00:43:44.520 funeral, Mark Anthony, Caesar's closest
00:43:48.000 ally and high priest, gave a speech,
00:43:51.200 just unrolled Caesar's bloodstained
00:43:53.280 toga, held it up for the crowd to see,
00:43:56.319 showed them where the knives had gone
00:43:57.920 in, and Rome wept. Riots broke out. The
00:44:01.599 homes of the conspirators were attacked.
00:44:04.160 They fled, not hailed as saviors, but
00:44:07.839 hunted like criminals. The republic they
00:44:10.560 thought they had rescued was dissolving.
00:44:13.280 And in the vacuum, three new players
00:44:15.520 stepped into the spotlight. First, Mark
00:44:18.480 Anthony, charming, brave, experienced,
00:44:22.560 and impulsive. He had been Caesar's
00:44:25.119 right hand, his co-consul, and some said
00:44:29.520 his intended heir. Second, Marcus
00:44:33.319 Emilius
00:44:34.920 Lepedus, less famous but powerful. He
00:44:38.440 commanded legions and wealth, and that
00:44:41.680 was enough. And third, a young man from
00:44:45.200 the countryside, barely 20, thin, pale,
00:44:50.079 with sharp eyes and sharper ambition.
00:44:53.040 His name was Gaes
00:44:56.119 Octavius. But soon the world would know
00:44:59.040 him as Augustus. Octavian was Caesar's
00:45:02.079 great nephew and unknown to most. Caesar
00:45:05.680 had named
00:45:06.839 him heir in his will. That meant more
00:45:09.599 than money. It meant
00:45:11.960 legitimacy. It meant power. At first,
00:45:15.599 few took him seriously.
00:45:18.160 He was young,
00:45:19.880 inexperienced, quiet, but Octavian was
00:45:23.359 also calculating, patient, and utterly
00:45:27.079 ruthless when it counted. He marched to
00:45:30.160 Rome with a private army, formed a tense
00:45:33.119 alliance with Anthony and
00:45:35.000 Lepedus. With Dino, together they
00:45:37.839 created the second Tvirit, a legal
00:45:40.640 dictatorship of three men. To seal the
00:45:43.359 deal, Octavian offered his sister
00:45:46.319 Octavia in marriage to Anthony. It was
00:45:48.960 all politics, all positioning. And then
00:45:52.800 came the prescriptions. Enemies were
00:45:55.400 listed. Hundreds of senators and
00:45:57.880 knights. Some were
00:45:59.880 rivals. Others were merely inconvenient.
00:46:02.960 If your name was on the list, you were
00:46:05.119 to be killed. Your property seized.
00:46:08.319 Heads were displayed in the forum. Rome
00:46:11.119 bled again. Among the victims, Cicero,
00:46:14.160 the great orator, who had once warned
00:46:16.880 against tyranny and corruption. He tried
00:46:19.119 to flee, but was caught and
00:46:22.040 executed. They cut off his hands, the
00:46:24.880 ones that had written so many damning
00:46:26.720 words, and nailed them up for all to
00:46:29.240 see. A warning, a message, with the old
00:46:32.880 guard purged. The Tribe turned their
00:46:35.680 attention to Brutus and Casius, now
00:46:38.960 raising armies in the east. The clash
00:46:41.280 came at the battle of Philippi in 42
00:46:44.319 B.CE. It was brutal, confusing, muddy.
00:46:48.240 But in the end, the liberators lost.
00:46:50.960 Brutus fell on his sword. Casius took
00:46:54.319 his own life. The republic already
00:46:57.319 dying. Had no defenders left. But peace
00:47:00.880 didn't swallow. Anthony went east to
00:47:04.640 govern the
00:47:05.800 provinces. And there he met Cleopatra.
00:47:09.359 Their romance became the stuff of
00:47:11.839 legend. She was older now, wiser, still
00:47:15.920 magnetic. He was bold, impulsive, and
00:47:19.760 looking for something, perhaps purpose,
00:47:23.040 perhaps escape. Together they lived, not
00:47:26.640 like governors and generals, but like
00:47:28.560 pharaohs, draped in gold, feasting,
00:47:31.280 sailing down the Nile, as if the world
00:47:33.920 itself bowed to them. They had children,
00:47:36.960 declared them kings and queens of
00:47:39.040 distant lands. Antony even promised
00:47:41.520 Cleopatra that Rome would acknowledge
00:47:43.680 their union and their heirs. Octavian,
00:47:47.359 back in Rome, watched it all, and then
00:47:49.920 he acted with a genius for narrative. He
00:47:53.440 launched a campaign not of swords, but
00:47:56.640 of words. He portrayed Anthony as a
00:47:59.119 traitor, a man who had abandoned his
00:48:01.359 Roman wife, Octavia for a foreign queen,
00:48:05.280 a man who had gone native, dressing like
00:48:08.079 an Egyptian, giving away Roman lands to
00:48:10.480 his lover's children. Rome was
00:48:13.720 scandalized. Outraged, war was declared.
00:48:17.520 The final confrontation came at sea. The
00:48:20.400 Battle of Actum in 31 B.CE. Octavian's
00:48:24.400 admiral, a gripper, cornered Antony and
00:48:28.079 Cleopatra's fleet. The fighting was
00:48:30.559 fierce. Cleopatra's ships were heavy,
00:48:33.800 ornate, beautiful, and slow. When the
00:48:36.880 tide turned, the queen broke through the
00:48:39.359 line and fled. Anthony followed. His
00:48:42.079 soldiers left behind surrendered. The
00:48:45.280 lovers retreated to Egypt to Alexandria.
00:48:49.599 When Octavian arrived, the city fell
00:48:52.640 without resistance. Anthony, in despair,
00:48:56.319 fell on his sword.
00:48:58.280 Cleopatra, faced with the humiliation of
00:49:00.880 being paraded through Roman chains,
00:49:03.760 chose her own death. Some say she used a
00:49:06.400 venomous asp, a snake hidden in a basket
00:49:09.680 of figs, others say poison, slipped into
00:49:13.520 a comb or vial. However it happened, her
00:49:17.200 body was found serene,
00:49:19.720 dignified, royal to the last. Octaven
00:49:23.359 stood over her tomb, silent and
00:49:26.720 blinking, he allowed her and Anthony to
00:49:30.240 be buried together. A final act of mercy
00:49:33.839 or theater. Back in Rome, there was no
00:49:37.599 more opposition. Octaven was hailed as
00:49:41.079 savior, peacemaker, restorer of order in
00:49:45.040 27 B.CEE. He formally returned power to
00:49:49.119 the Senate who in gratitude gave it all
00:49:52.800 right back along with a new name,
00:49:55.720 Augustus, but revered one. He didn't
00:49:58.640 call himself king or emperor, but he was
00:50:01.440 both and more. Augustus ruled softly,
00:50:05.359 carefully, always speaking of restoring
00:50:07.839 the republic while quietly reshaping it.
00:50:11.040 He kept the Senate, but made sure it
00:50:13.359 only passed what he proposed. He
00:50:15.599 controlled the army, the treasury, the
00:50:18.079 courts. He called himself prince, the
00:50:21.119 first citizen, not dictator, not god,
00:50:24.640 just first. He created the Ptorian
00:50:28.280 Guard, an elite unit to protect the
00:50:31.119 emperor. and sometimes, as we'll see, to
00:50:34.480 decide who would wear the purple. He
00:50:36.880 rebuilt Rome in marble, funded roads,
00:50:40.599 aqueducts, temples, praised family
00:50:43.520 values and moral virtue, even as
00:50:46.400 whispers of his private life told
00:50:48.640 another story. He exiled his own
00:50:50.880 daughter, Julia, for her scandalous
00:50:53.319 affairs. Duty, he said, came before
00:50:56.319 blood. And yet in his long reign, nearly
00:51:00.400 45 years, Augustus never named a clear
00:51:03.839 successor. He adopted heirs, groomed
00:51:06.480 them, and watched them die. One after
00:51:09.599 another, his chosen heir, Tiberius, was
00:51:12.960 his stepson. Cold, distant, and
00:51:16.160 brooding. And when Augustus died in 14
00:51:19.319 CE, Rome didn't revolt. The Senate
00:51:22.240 mourned, the people wept, and Tiberius
00:51:26.400 became emperor. There was no
00:51:28.920 declaration, no new republic. The empire
00:51:32.480 had passed
00:51:34.359 quietly, like dusk turning into night.
00:51:37.839 No one knew exactly when the light had
00:51:39.960 gone, but it had. Rome had become an
00:51:43.280 empire, and the emperors had only just
00:51:46.319 begun. When Augustus died, Rome did not
00:51:49.599 erupt in violence or fear. It bowed its
00:51:52.520 head, exhaled slowly, and kept going.
00:51:56.240 The machine was still moving, the empire
00:51:59.599 still standing. But behind the public
00:52:02.079 calm, something colder was taking the
00:52:04.720 throne. Tiberius. Tiberius wasn't like
00:52:08.079 Augustus. It's where Augustus was
00:52:10.240 smooth, diplomatic, almost fatherly.
00:52:13.200 Tiberius was stiff, paranoid, reserved.
00:52:17.359 He spoke like a man who weighed every
00:52:19.440 word before letting it go and often
00:52:22.079 regretted it once he did. He hadn't even
00:52:24.880 wanted to be emperor. Not really. He'd
00:52:28.400 been a soldier, a recluse, a man better
00:52:32.000 suited to shadows than temples. And yet,
00:52:35.200 for the first few years, Tiberius ruled
00:52:38.000 well, cautiously, conservatively. He
00:52:41.599 kept the Senate intact, balanced the
00:52:44.160 treasury, avoided wars. But the further
00:52:47.200 he got from Augustus' legacy, the more
00:52:49.839 withdrawn he became. They say he trusted
00:52:52.880 no one, not his advisers, not his
00:52:55.760 family, especially not a man named
00:52:58.200 Senus. Senus was the head of the Ptorian
00:53:01.280 Guard, the Emperor's elite protectors.
00:53:04.480 But he wasn't just a soldier. He was a
00:53:07.280 spider, quiet, patient. Waiting. Slowly,
00:53:11.440 he gained Tiberius's trust. Slowly, he
00:53:14.640 began eliminating rivals. Senators were
00:53:17.280 accused of treason. Executed, exiled.
00:53:21.520 Some simply vanished. And then, just as
00:53:25.280 Senus was tightening his grip, Tiberius
00:53:28.400 did something strange. He left. He
00:53:31.520 retired from public life and moved to
00:53:34.240 the island of Capri. a beautiful
00:53:36.960 cliffside retreat overlooking the sea,
00:53:40.319 far from the noise and conspiracy of
00:53:42.480 Rome. From there he ruled remotely,
00:53:45.440 sending letters, issuing commands,
00:53:48.559 hearing whispers. The empire was in the
00:53:50.800 hands of secretaries and agents. And it
00:53:53.359 was on Capri that the rumors began. Dark
00:53:56.280 stories, wild tales of orgies, cruelty
00:54:00.240 and madness, of boys dressed as fish and
00:54:03.680 elderly senators forced to crawl on
00:54:06.480 their hands. Whether true or
00:54:09.720 exaggerated, they spread and they stuck.
00:54:13.440 Tiberius became the monster on the
00:54:15.760 mountain. Back in Rome, Sylvanus grew
00:54:18.960 bolder. He was engaged to Tiberius's
00:54:21.599 niece. He had allies in every corner. It
00:54:24.559 looked like he would take the throne.
00:54:26.559 That the spider had flown too close to
00:54:28.559 the sun. In 31 CE, a letter arrived in
00:54:33.119 Rome. A simple piece of
00:54:35.480 parchment carried from Capri. It was
00:54:38.640 read aloud in the Senate. And as the
00:54:41.119 words
00:54:41.960 unfolded, Senus turned pale. The letter
00:54:45.839 condemned him as a traitor. Within hours
00:54:49.200 he was
00:54:50.520 arrested, dragged from the chamber,
00:54:53.960 executed. His body left to rot on the
00:54:56.559 Gmonian steps, the stairs of mourning
00:55:00.319 where the people spat and threw stones.
00:55:03.119 His children were hunted, his name
00:55:06.760 erased. Tiberius had struck, and it was
00:55:10.839 brutal. But he didn't return to Rome. He
00:55:13.920 stayed on Capri, more distant than ever.
00:55:16.800 The empire ran on fear and inertia. And
00:55:20.000 when Tiberius finally died in 37 CE,
00:55:24.160 most people didn't mourn. Some even
00:55:26.599 cheered. His successor was already
00:55:28.800 waiting. A boy raised in military
00:55:31.880 camps. Beloved by the legions, the son
00:55:35.119 of
00:55:36.280 Germanicus, Rome's golden general. His
00:55:39.440 name was Gas, but everyone knew him by a
00:55:42.319 nickname, one he'd carried since
00:55:44.319 childhood. Caligula little boots. At
00:55:48.240 first it seemed like light after
00:55:50.839 darkness. The people adored him. He gave
00:55:54.640 bonuses to soldiers, hosted lavish
00:55:57.960 games, burned the list of traitors,
00:56:01.040 freed those exiled by Tiberious. It was
00:56:04.240 springtime in Rome. But then something
00:56:07.640 shifted. 6 months into his reign,
00:56:10.799 Caligula fell ill, very ill. He was
00:56:14.079 expected to die. Prayers were made,
00:56:16.640 sacrifices offered, and then
00:56:19.480 miraculously he recovered. But the man
00:56:22.079 who stood up from that sick bed was not
00:56:24.799 the same man who had fallen into it.
00:56:27.119 What followed were four of the most
00:56:29.760 infamous years in imperial history.
00:56:32.480 Caligula became unpredictable. At first,
00:56:35.040 it was just strange. He made his horse
00:56:38.440 insetatus, a priest, perhaps even a
00:56:41.319 senator, depending on the version. He
00:56:43.920 ordered bridges, built across bays for
00:56:47.599 no reason. He dressed as gods, demanded
00:56:50.559 worship, referred to himself as a living
00:56:53.520 deity, and then it got darker.
00:56:56.240 Executions became common, not for
00:56:59.200 crimes, but for fun. He invited guests
00:57:02.400 to dinner and had them arrested midmeal.
00:57:05.440 He mocked the Senate, humiliated noble
00:57:09.000 families, and drained the treasury with
00:57:11.839 impossible projects. As spitter as one
00:57:15.079 story, whispered more than written, of
00:57:18.480 Caligula standing before a crowd during
00:57:21.119 a grain shortage. The people cried out
00:57:23.760 for help. He looked down from his
00:57:25.520 balcony and said, "Let them eat stones."
00:57:29.280 Another time during a storm he
00:57:32.319 supposedly commanded the sea to be
00:57:34.520 whipped. The waves flogged for their
00:57:37.160 defiance. Whether these tales are all
00:57:39.599 true or embroidered with time, they all
00:57:43.200 pointed to the same truth. Caligula had
00:57:46.400 become terrifying, and Rome began to
00:57:48.880 hold its breath. Eventually, a plot
00:57:51.760 formed.
00:57:53.400 Quietly, carefully, the Ptorian guard
00:57:57.359 who had once raised him to power decided
00:58:00.400 enough was enough. In 41 CE, in a
00:58:03.920 corridor of the Imperial Palace, they
00:58:06.960 struck daggers in daylight. Caligula
00:58:10.559 died with disbelief on his face. Not
00:58:13.119 that he had been attacked, but that
00:58:15.839 anyone dared. His body was thrown into a
00:58:18.799 shallow grave. The people did not
00:58:21.799 protest. But then came the question, who
00:58:24.799 now? The Senate
00:58:26.760 debated restoring the republic. Old
00:58:29.680 speeches were dusted off. Idealism
00:58:32.359 returned for about 48 hours because
00:58:35.760 outside the chamber, the Ptorians had
00:58:39.119 found someone hiding behind a curtain,
00:58:42.400 trembling, limping, stammering.
00:58:45.559 Claudius, the uncle of Caligula, the
00:58:48.880 brother of Germanicus, a man most
00:58:51.920 thought a fool, weak, forgettable,
00:58:56.000 mocked for his stutter and limp. But the
00:58:59.040 guard didn't care. He had the right
00:59:02.040 bloodline. He was the last of Augustus's
00:59:05.520 family. So they brought him out,
00:59:07.839 declared him emperor. And once the shock
00:59:10.559 wore off, Claudius surprised everyone.
00:59:14.480 He was no fool. Claudius didn't look
00:59:16.880 like an emperor. He limped when he
00:59:19.400 walked. He stuttered when he spoke. His
00:59:23.040 head twitched when he got nervous. And
00:59:26.400 for most of his life, his own family
00:59:29.119 treated him like a joke. He'd been
00:59:30.799 hidden away during dangerous reigns.
00:59:34.160 Considered
00:59:35.160 harmless, passed over for nearly every
00:59:37.920 role of importance. Some say that's the
00:59:40.480 only reason he survived the blood soaked
00:59:43.359 days of Caligula. He wasn't seen as a
00:59:46.000 threat. But the moment he put on the
00:59:48.079 purple, everything changed. He was
00:59:50.920 thoughtful, intelligent, and perhaps
00:59:54.480 most importantly, deliberate. He
00:59:57.040 surrounded himself with capable
00:59:59.040 freedman, former slaves, now loyal
01:00:02.040 advisers. And slowly, methodically, he
01:00:05.599 brought stability back to the empire. He
01:00:08.160 reformed the legal system, personally
01:00:10.720 judging cases like a father settling
01:00:13.359 disputes in his home. He improved grain
01:00:15.760 supply, expanded infrastructure, and
01:00:18.559 made sure the water flowed to the
01:00:20.720 poorest parts of the city. And he did
01:00:22.960 something no Roman emperor had done
01:00:25.280 before him. He invaded Britain in 43 CE.
01:00:29.440 He sent his legions across the sea and
01:00:32.000 claimed the Misty Island as a Roman
01:00:34.400 province. He even made the journey
01:00:36.480 himself.
01:00:38.000 riding into Colchester on an elephant.
01:00:40.960 Because if you're going to rule an
01:00:42.520 empire, you might as well arrive like a
01:00:44.960 legend. But Claudius greatest weakness
01:00:47.599 was love. He married poorly, and often
01:00:51.440 his third wife, Messylina, was
01:00:54.720 beautiful, ambitious, and allegedly
01:00:58.240 quite unfaithful. According to some
01:01:00.520 sources, she held a public contest to
01:01:04.000 see who could sleep with more men in one
01:01:06.000 night. Others say she plotted to
01:01:08.000 overthrow him. Either way, Claudius had
01:01:10.799 her executed when her schemes became too
01:01:13.920 dangerous to ignore. After that, he
01:01:16.799 married his niece. Yes, his niece,
01:01:20.040 Agraina, the younger, a power-hungry
01:01:23.440 descendant of Augustus, mother of a boy
01:01:26.799 named Lucius Dicius
01:01:29.720 Ahernabarbas. You might know him better
01:01:31.760 as Nero. Claudius adopted Nero, made him
01:01:35.599 heir, and slowly began preparing him to
01:01:38.319 rule. Agraina was relentless. She
01:01:41.520 isolated Claudius's own son,
01:01:44.280 Britannicus, maneuvered allies into
01:01:46.680 place. And made herself the most
01:01:48.960 powerful woman in Rome. Then in 54 CE,
01:01:52.720 Claudius died. The official story was
01:01:55.920 food poisoning. The whispered version.
01:01:58.839 mushrooms laced with poison, served by
01:02:02.000 his own wife, Nero became emperor at
01:02:05.040 just 16 years old. And at first, it
01:02:08.160 wasn't bad. With guidance from his
01:02:10.799 mother, Agraina, his tutor, Senica, and
01:02:14.160 the general Burus, Nero ruled gently. He
01:02:17.680 gave cash to the poor, banned capital
01:02:20.040 punishment, hosted games, festivals,
01:02:24.000 poetry readings. He was young,
01:02:26.599 theatrical, cultured. The people loved
01:02:29.280 him, but he was also fragile, possessed
01:02:32.880 with performance, and deeply torn
01:02:35.200 between those pulling the strings around
01:02:37.200 him. His mother, Agraina, wanted to rule
01:02:40.640 through him when she realized she was
01:02:43.200 losing control. She threatened to
01:02:45.359 support Britannicus, Claudius's true
01:02:48.000 son. Days later, Britannicus was dead,
01:02:51.400 poisoned like his father. After that,
01:02:54.559 Nero grew distant and then deadly. He
01:02:57.520 resented his mother's grip, her power,
01:03:00.240 her voice, her memory. He tried to kill
01:03:02.960 her several times, collapsing her
01:03:05.280 bedroom ceiling, rigging a boat to sink
01:03:07.599 in the bay. She survived it all.
01:03:10.079 Finally, he gave the order. Soldiers
01:03:12.880 were sent. Agraina met them with
01:03:15.440 dignity. She bared her chest, telling
01:03:18.319 them to strike the womb that bore him,
01:03:20.559 and they did. With his mother gone, Nero
01:03:23.440 became Nero. He fancied himself an
01:03:26.559 artist, a poet, an actor. He took to the
01:03:30.000 stage, singing tragedies while nobles
01:03:33.039 were forced to watch in silence, some
01:03:35.599 pretending to faint just to escape the
01:03:38.160 performance. He competed in chariot
01:03:40.640 races, which he conveniently always won.
01:03:43.599 He married and then murdered his first
01:03:46.559 wife, Octavia, then married Poppia, whom
01:03:50.160 he later kicked to death while she was
01:03:52.400 pregnant. Rome had seen tyrants, but
01:03:55.119 never one like this. And then in 64 CE
01:03:59.839 came the fire. For 9 days, Rome burned.
01:04:04.079 Whole districts vanished. The air was
01:04:06.960 thick with smoke and screams. and Nero.
01:04:10.400 Some say he stood on a rooftop in a
01:04:12.400 costume singing of the fall of Troy
01:04:14.480 while flames devoured the city. Either
01:04:16.960 way, the rumor stuck. To deflect blame,
01:04:20.240 he needed a scapegoat. He chose the
01:04:22.640 Christians, a small, strange sect that
01:04:26.160 refused to worship Roman gods. They were
01:04:28.720 rounded up, tortured, crucified, burned
01:04:32.319 alive to light Nero's gardens at
01:04:34.400 night. It was the first major
01:04:36.680 persecution and it would not be the
01:04:38.880 last. But the empire was growing tired
01:04:41.359 of him. The provinces rebelled. The army
01:04:44.480 grew restless. Even his advisers fled.
01:04:47.680 In 68 CE, the Senate declared him a
01:04:50.880 public enemy. Nero fled the city with a
01:04:54.000 few loyal men. As soldiers closed in, he
01:04:57.119 begged them to kill him. None would. In
01:04:59.760 the end, he took his own life with help
01:05:02.160 from a servant. His last words, "What an
01:05:05.520 artist dies with me." With his death,
01:05:08.240 the line of Augustus ended. The Julio
01:05:11.280 Claudian dynasty, begun with caution,
01:05:14.240 built with cunning and collapsed with
01:05:16.480 madness, was over, and Rome would now be
01:05:19.599 ruled by the sword. With Nero gone, Rome
01:05:23.280 took a breath and then forgot how to
01:05:25.760 exhale. The empire had no heir, no clear
01:05:30.280 direction, no dynasty. And so came
01:05:33.880 chaos. In 69 CE, just a year after
01:05:37.680 Nero's death, Rome saw not one, not two,
01:05:42.000 but four emperors, four men who wore the
01:05:44.520 purple, each thinking they were destined
01:05:46.880 to rule, and each leaving behind
01:05:49.079 wreckage, blood or stone. The first was
01:05:53.160 Galba, a stern old general with a face
01:05:56.640 like a carving and a heart like a
01:05:58.960 ledger. He preached discipline, cut
01:06:01.680 spending, and refused to pay the
01:06:04.559 soldiers who had declared him emperor.
01:06:07.039 That was a mistake. Loyalty in Rome ran
01:06:10.240 on coin and Galba had none to spare.
01:06:13.200 Within months, he was murdered by the
01:06:14.960 Ptorian guard. His body dumped in the
01:06:17.960 forum, his severed head paraded on a
01:06:20.599 pike. The second was Oo, a former friend
01:06:24.240 of Nero, sharp and opportunistic with a
01:06:28.000 taste for luxury and a hunger for power.
01:06:31.280 He seized control quickly, but faced a
01:06:34.160 rival in the east. Forellius, a general
01:06:37.920 with allegiance behind him and no
01:06:40.400 appetite for compromise.
01:06:42.559 Oo, realizing civil war would ruin Rome,
01:06:45.839 took his own life rather than prolong
01:06:47.599 the bloodshed. It was a rare gesture,
01:06:51.000 noble, almost forgotten. The third
01:06:53.359 emperor was
01:06:55.160 Forellius, a glutton, a brute, he gorged
01:06:59.440 himself on food, flattery, and violence.
01:07:03.599 His banquetss lasted for days. His
01:07:06.319 enemies were drowned in rivers, burned
01:07:08.720 in gardens, tortured in cellars beneath
01:07:11.599 palaces he never earned. Rome staggered
01:07:14.640 under his rule, bloated and confused.
01:07:17.599 And then came the fourth. His name was
01:07:20.839 Vespasian. Vespasian was not born into
01:07:24.760 nobility. He didn't write poetry. He
01:07:28.000 didn't throw orgies. He didn't charm the
01:07:30.880 Senate, but he knew how to command.
01:07:33.920 He had been in Judea suppressing a
01:07:35.760 rebellion when he heard the news of
01:07:37.920 Rome's unraveling. His soldiers,
01:07:40.079 veterans, disciplined, loyal, declared
01:07:42.720 him emperor. And unlike the others, he
01:07:46.000 earned it.
01:07:47.640 Slowly, carefully, he marched back to
01:07:50.559 Rome, securing support, neutralizing
01:07:53.559 resistance. When Vitellius refused to
01:07:55.920 step aside, the city exploded into open
01:07:58.799 combat. Streets became battlefields. The
01:08:01.680 temple of Jupiter burned and when it was
01:08:04.559 done, Vitellius was dragged through the
01:08:06.559 streets begging for his life. He was
01:08:10.119 executed, his body thrown in the river.
01:08:13.359 The Spasian entered the city not as a
01:08:15.200 god or a prince or a play thing of fate,
01:08:18.399 but as a builder. He was practical,
01:08:20.880 steady,
01:08:22.439 drywitted. His favorite motto, pecunia
01:08:26.279 nonlet, money doesn't stink. He even
01:08:28.960 taxed public urinals.
01:08:31.198 Rome needed money. Vespasian found it.
01:08:34.640 He restored order, balanced the budget,
01:08:37.359 and rebuilt what had been lost. He began
01:08:39.439 construction of the Flavian
01:08:40.799 amphitheater, what we now call the
01:08:43.158 coliseum. It was a gift to the people, a
01:08:46.759 distraction, a
01:08:48.520 message. The emperor may change, but
01:08:51.799 Rome, Rome endures. His sons were less
01:08:55.040 subtle. Titus the elder was handsome,
01:08:59.960 well-liked, a natural showman. He
01:09:02.560 completed the coliseum, celebrated with
01:09:05.439 a 100 days of games, gladiators, beasts,
01:09:09.040 mock naval battles. When Mount Vuvius
01:09:11.759 erupted in 79 CE, burying Pompei and
01:09:15.120 Herculanium in ash, Titus led relief
01:09:18.000 efforts personally. He gave aid, rebuilt
01:09:21.319 towns, comforted survivors.
01:09:24.479 He was beloved and then suddenly he
01:09:28.040 died. Fever they said or poison. His
01:09:32.399 last words reportedly I have made but
01:09:36.080 one mistake. No one knows what he meant.
01:09:39.759 Then came the mission. The younger son,
01:09:43.000 brooding, bitter, paranoid. He didn't
01:09:46.000 share power with the Senate. He didn't
01:09:48.399 pretend to. He called himself Lord and
01:09:51.040 God. built statues of himself, purged
01:09:55.000 enemies, executed senators. He ruled for
01:09:58.560 15 years, longer than most. And in the
01:10:01.920 end, even his own servants couldn't take
01:10:04.640 it. They stabbed him in his palace, in
01:10:07.679 96 CE, and left his memory to be
01:10:10.960 condemned. His statues were smashed, his
01:10:14.480 name erased from inscriptions.
01:10:17.159 Officially, he had never existed. But
01:10:19.920 Rome, remember, after the death of
01:10:21.800 Domission, Rome could have spiraled
01:10:24.199 again. But instead, it paused. And into
01:10:28.320 that silence stepped a man named Nerva,
01:10:31.520 an older senator, wise, careful. He
01:10:35.040 wasn't a conqueror or a builder or a
01:10:38.199 tyrant. He was a placeholder, but an
01:10:41.199 important one. He set a precedent that
01:10:43.920 would shape the next century. He adopted
01:10:46.719 his successor, not his son, not his
01:10:49.520 nephew, but the best man for the job.
01:10:52.239 And that man was Trajan. Trejan was
01:10:55.600 everything Rome needed. A general, a
01:10:58.400 statesman, a man of action. Under his
01:11:01.280 rule, the empire reached its maximum
01:11:03.679 size from the Atlantic to the Persian
01:11:06.239 Gulf, from Britain to the sands of
01:11:08.640 Arabia. His conquest of Deia, modern-day
01:11:11.840 Romania, was brutal and complete. The
01:11:15.040 gold from those mountains poured into
01:11:17.520 Rome. Monuments were raised. Most
01:11:20.159 famously, Trejan's column spiraling
01:11:23.120 upward with carvings that told the story
01:11:25.199 of his victory. Frozen in stone,
01:11:27.840 climbing toward the gods. But Trejan
01:11:30.320 wasn't just a warrior. He cared for the
01:11:32.960 poor, launched public building programs,
01:11:36.000 made sure grain flowed to the cities.
01:11:38.480 His reign was seen as a golden age,
01:11:41.199 strong, fair, expansive. When he died,
01:11:44.640 his adopted son took the throne. His
01:11:47.520 name was Hadrien. Hadrien didn't want
01:11:50.000 more land. He wanted stability,
01:11:53.960 security. He gave up some of Trajan's
01:11:56.640 eastern conquests, pulled back the
01:11:59.120 borders, and began reinforcing what Rome
01:12:02.159 already held. He traveled constantly to
01:12:04.800 Britain, Egypt, Gaul, Greece, walking
01:12:08.480 the empire like a gardener, inspecting
01:12:11.360 every route. In Britain, he built a
01:12:14.159 wall, Hadron's wall, stretching coast to
01:12:17.440 coast to mark the edge of the Roman
01:12:19.120 world. It wasn't just defense. It was a
01:12:22.239 line, a message this far, and no
01:12:25.280 further. He loved Greek culture, wore a
01:12:28.400 beard like a philosopher, and surrounded
01:12:31.199 himself with art and ideas. But he was
01:12:33.679 also proud, stubborn. And when the
01:12:36.640 Jewish population in Judea rebelled, he
01:12:39.679 crushed the revolt with fury, entire
01:12:42.159 cities were flattened, thousands killed,
01:12:45.520 the province was renamed, and Jerusalem
01:12:48.560 was rebuilt in Roman image. No mercy,
01:12:52.159 just stone. Later in life, Hadrien
01:12:55.040 mourned the death of Antonus, a
01:12:57.360 beautiful young Greek he loved dearly.
01:12:59.600 He deified him, built statues, temples,
01:13:03.679 even a city in his name. No one dared
01:13:06.159 question it. Hadrien was emperor, an
01:13:08.640 emperor's made gods. When he died, he
01:13:11.280 was buried in a massive morale beside
01:13:13.600 the Tyber, a round fortress that still
01:13:16.640 stands today, though few remember whose
01:13:19.440 bones it holds. His heir was Antonyinus
01:13:22.719 Pus, a quiet, gentle ruler. He reigned
01:13:26.239 for over 20 years, and almost nothing
01:13:29.360 terrible happened. No wars, no
01:13:32.520 purges, no scandals. Historians barely
01:13:36.000 know what to say about him except that
01:13:38.640 he kept the peace. And maybe that's
01:13:41.440 enough. His adoptive son, however, would
01:13:44.640 become something more. A philosopher, a
01:13:47.520 soldier, a reluctant emperor. Marcus
01:13:51.239 Aurelius. If you've ever heard the
01:13:53.280 phrase stoic or read the book
01:13:55.800 Meditations, you've heard Marcus's
01:13:58.000 voice. He wrote his thoughts down, not
01:14:00.640 for publication, but for himself. Notes
01:14:03.600 on life, duty, the universe. Wisdom
01:14:07.760 written between campaigns, beside tents,
01:14:11.120 beneath stars. He spent much of his
01:14:13.520 reign at war, defending the empire's
01:14:15.920 long borders. The Paththeians in the
01:14:18.320 east, the Germanic tribes in the north.
01:14:21.360 The empire was rich but restless. His
01:14:24.640 writings reveal a man trying to hold it
01:14:27.199 all together. The burden of power, the
01:14:30.239 ache of loss, the weight of being good
01:14:32.880 in a world that often wasn't. During his
01:14:35.679 reign, a plague swept through the
01:14:37.840 empire, brought back by soldiers,
01:14:40.400 killing millions. He kept going. He
01:14:43.360 fought. He wrote, he mourned. But Marcus
01:14:47.280 made one mistake, a deeply human one. He
01:14:51.600 loved his son. His name was Comeodus.
01:14:54.560 Comeodus was everything. Marcus Aurelius
01:14:57.920 wasn't. Where his father pondered the
01:15:00.440 universe. Comedus posed in mirrors.
01:15:03.440 Where Marcus read
01:15:05.080 philosophy. Comeodus dressed as
01:15:07.480 Hercules. Where Marcus wrote
01:15:10.199 meditations. Comeodus wrote nothing at
01:15:12.480 all. He inherited the empire in 180 CE
01:15:17.040 at just 19 years old. Young, rich,
01:15:20.719 adored by the legions and already
01:15:23.360 convinced of his own divinity. At first,
01:15:26.880 people hoped he might grow into the
01:15:28.800 role, but he didn't grow. He indulged.
01:15:32.400 He abandoned the wars his father had
01:15:34.560 fought, signed treaties, and retreated
01:15:37.440 to Rome. There he turned the palace into
01:15:40.000 a playground. He renamed months after
01:15:42.800 himself, renamed Rome itself after
01:15:46.199 himself, declared that every statue in
01:15:48.880 the empire must bear his face. And then
01:15:51.520 he went to the arena, not to watch, to
01:15:54.719 fight as a gladiator, dressed in lion
01:15:57.679 skins, armed with wooden swords for
01:16:00.280 show. Comeodus performed for the crowds,
01:16:03.679 demanding applause, demanding love,
01:16:06.480 demanding the world kneel to his
01:16:08.080 fantasy. Senators were horrified. The
01:16:10.960 people were confused, the Ptorian guard.
01:16:14.440 Eventually, the games stopped being
01:16:16.800 amusing. Comeodus grew paranoid.
01:16:19.760 Executions returned. So did Whispers. In
01:16:24.159 192 CE, his mistress and a small group
01:16:27.360 of conspirators plotted quietly. One of
01:16:30.640 his wrestling partners was chosen. On
01:16:32.719 New Year's Eve, as Rome prepared to
01:16:34.640 welcome a new century, Comeodus was
01:16:37.280 strangled in his bath. The city awoke to
01:16:39.800 celebration and surprise. The emperor
01:16:43.199 was dead and again Rome was without
01:16:45.920 direction. The next year became known as
01:16:48.560 the year of the five emperors to chaos
01:16:51.760 once more. Ambitious generals rose and
01:16:54.400 fell like dice across a map. Among them
01:16:57.520 was Septimius Seis, a North African
01:17:00.800 general with a soldier's discipline and
01:17:03.440 an iron heart. He marched on Rome,
01:17:06.000 defeated rivals, and declared himself
01:17:08.800 emperor. He executed senators, rebuilt
01:17:11.920 the military, and made one thing clear.
01:17:14.640 The emperor ruled through the army, not
01:17:17.040 the Senate. He traveled constantly,
01:17:19.760 fought campaigns in Britain and the
01:17:21.920 East, and spent more time in armor than
01:17:24.480 in a toga. When he died, he gave his
01:17:26.960 sons one last piece of advice. Enrich
01:17:29.600 the soldiers and ignore everyone else.
01:17:32.320 His sons were Caracala and Getter. They
01:17:36.080 hated each other. They shared power for
01:17:38.320 a moment. A cold, tense moment. And
01:17:42.159 Caracala had Getter assassinated in
01:17:45.120 their mother's arms. He killed thousands
01:17:47.280 of Getter's supporters. Erased his
01:17:49.679 brother's name from inscriptions,
01:17:52.840 paintings, even faces on coins. Damn
01:17:55.920 Nachio Memorier. The death of memory.
01:17:59.280 Caracala ruled alone now. brutal,
01:18:02.840 impatient, obsessed with power. But he
01:18:05.600 did one remarkable thing. He granted
01:18:08.320 Roman citizenship to every free man in
01:18:10.719 the empire. Not for charity, for taxes.
01:18:14.080 But it changed everything. Suddenly, the
01:18:16.800 idea of Rome wasn't a city. It was the
01:18:20.080 world. Anyone could be Roman in name. At
01:18:23.120 least in 217 CE. Caracala was stabbed by
01:18:28.239 one of his own soldiers while relieving
01:18:30.800 himself on the side of a road. No
01:18:33.040 funeral, no ceremony, just dust. The
01:18:36.960 severe dynasty limped on through short
01:18:40.199 reigns, palace intrigue, distant
01:18:44.120 campaigns until a boy named Elgabilus
01:18:47.040 took the throne. He was 14. He worshiped
01:18:50.640 a sun god from Syria, wore makeup,
01:18:54.000 married and divorced both men and women,
01:18:56.719 and declared himself a living deity.
01:18:59.199 Rome was not ready. The chaos was too
01:19:02.239 much even for an empire used to madness.
01:19:05.760 Ellegabilus was assassinated by the
01:19:08.920 Ptorians. His body dragged through the
01:19:11.400 streets, thrown into the Tyber. His
01:19:14.159 cousin, a teenager named Seis Alexander,
01:19:17.440 replaced him. kind, thoughtful, too
01:19:20.960 gentle for the world. He tried to rule
01:19:23.280 well, tried to restore order, but the
01:19:26.080 army didn't want kindness. They wanted
01:19:29.199 strength. And when the Germanic tribes
01:19:31.480 invaded, and Alexander tried to buy
01:19:34.080 peace instead of war, his soldiers
01:19:36.400 murdered him in his tent with barely a
01:19:39.520 word. It was 235 CE, and what followed
01:19:44.080 was collapse. The murder of Seis
01:19:46.400 Alexander marked the beginning of
01:19:47.920 something Rome had never experienced
01:19:50.719 before. Not corruption or tyranny or
01:19:54.360 rebellion, but a slow, grinding
01:19:56.920 unraveling. Historians call it the
01:19:59.520 crisis of the 3rd century. For nearly 50
01:20:02.480 years, the Roman Empire was barely an
01:20:05.040 empire at all. It was a battlefield, a
01:20:08.320 revolving door, a mosaic of civil wars
01:20:11.120 and border invasions, of plagues and
01:20:14.080 bankrupt treasuries, of emperors whose
01:20:16.800 names barely had time to dry on official
01:20:19.719 decrees before they were killed,
01:20:22.480 replaced, and forgotten. Between
01:20:25.480 235 and 284 CE, more than 20 emperors
01:20:30.880 rose to power, most through violence,
01:20:34.239 almost none through inheritance. Some
01:20:36.880 ruled for years, others for weeks. Some
01:20:40.560 were generals raised by their legions,
01:20:43.040 cheered by soldiers, and stabbed days
01:20:45.440 later. Others were declared emperor by
01:20:47.840 accident, by mobs, by whispers, by
01:20:51.400 soldiers, desperate for someone, anyone
01:20:54.239 who could promise survival. The enemies
01:20:56.719 of Rome saw their chance. Germanic
01:20:59.440 tribes crossed the Rine. Goths swept
01:21:02.000 through the Balkans. In the east, the
01:21:04.400 once subdued Persians returned under the
01:21:06.880 Sassined dynasty, fierce, organized, and
01:21:10.320 ready for war. In 260 CE, the Persian
01:21:14.560 king Shapor Thai captured the Roman
01:21:17.040 Emperor Valyrian in battle. The first
01:21:19.920 and only time a Roman emperor was taken
01:21:22.239 alive by a foreign enemy. What happened
01:21:25.719 next became legend. Some say Valyrian
01:21:29.760 was kept in chains, paraded like a
01:21:32.480 trophy. Others say Shapor used him as a
01:21:35.360 foottool when mounting his horse. Still
01:21:38.080 others whisper he was flayed alive. his
01:21:41.199 skin stuffed with straw and hung in a
01:21:43.600 temple as a warning. But the humiliation
01:21:45.920 was real. Meanwhile, back in the west,
01:21:48.239 parts of the empire simply broke away.
01:21:50.800 In Gaul, Spain, and Britain, a
01:21:53.360 short-lived GIC empire, declared itself
01:21:56.000 independent. In the east, the wealthy
01:21:58.159 city of Palmira, led by the brilliant
01:22:00.639 and mysterious Queen Zenobia, carved out
01:22:03.840 its own realm. Elegant, powerful,
01:22:07.199 defiant, Zenobia ruled with grace and
01:22:10.400 steel, she styled herself queen of the
01:22:13.120 east, claimed descent from Cleopatra,
01:22:16.719 and led armies that pushed deep into
01:22:19.120 Roman territory. For a moment, it seemed
01:22:21.760 as if the empire might fracture for
01:22:24.080 good, broken not by one invader, but by
01:22:27.199 a thousand cuts. And then, finally came
01:22:31.040 a man who knew how to stop the bleeding.
01:22:33.360 His name was Aurelion. He wasn't from
01:22:36.159 noble stock. He didn't write poetry. He
01:22:39.840 didn't
01:22:40.679 philosophize. He was a soldier, one of
01:22:43.679 the best Rome ever produced. When he
01:22:46.080 became emperor in 270 CE, the empire was
01:22:50.159 on the edge of collapse. By the time of
01:22:52.560 his death, just 5 years later, it had
01:22:55.760 been stitched back together. He crushed
01:22:57.840 the GIC Empire, defeated Zenobia, and
01:23:01.120 brought Palmyra back into Roman hands.
01:23:03.840 When she was captured, she was paraded
01:23:06.719 through Rome. Regal, silent, unbroken.
01:23:10.320 Aelion spared her life. He admired
01:23:13.520 strength. He drove back the Goths,
01:23:16.320 rebuilt city walls, stabilized currency,
01:23:20.000 and earned a title that said everything.
01:23:22.719 Restitute Orbus, restorer of the world.
01:23:26.000 But even heroes aren't safe in this
01:23:28.159 story. In
01:23:30.040 275, Aurelion was assassinated by his
01:23:33.120 own staff. The result of forged letters,
01:23:36.159 palace gossip, and the endless churn of
01:23:38.880 power. It would take another man to do
01:23:41.120 that. Someone harder, colder, obsessed
01:23:44.159 not with the old ideals of Rome, but
01:23:46.480 with survival. His name was Diolesian.
01:23:49.440 When Diolesian took power in 284 CE, the
01:23:53.920 Roman Empire wasn't just wounded. It was
01:23:57.000 exhausted. 50 years of crisis had worn
01:23:59.920 down its bones. Borders were porous.
01:24:03.199 Armies were disloyal. The economy was in
01:24:05.840 ruins. Emperors died as fast as coins
01:24:09.040 could be minted with their faces.
01:24:11.120 Dilesian understood something that many
01:24:13.600 before him had refused to admit. The
01:24:16.400 empire was too big for one man to rule.
01:24:19.360 So he didn't try. He split it. He
01:24:23.040 appointed a co-emperor, a trusted
01:24:25.600 general named Maximian, and gave him
01:24:28.320 control of the west. While Dilesian
01:24:31.120 focused on the east, two emperors, two
01:24:34.320 courts, two capitals. But even that
01:24:37.520 wasn't enough. The Acclesian went
01:24:39.679 further creating the tetrarchy, the rule
01:24:42.560 of four, two senior emperors called
01:24:45.159 Augusti and two junior emperors called
01:24:47.920 Caesar is a chain of succession, a web
01:24:51.120 of command. The idea was stability
01:24:53.760 through structure, strength through
01:24:56.560 order. It worked for a time. Diolesian
01:25:00.239 didn't stop there. He divided the empire
01:25:02.960 into smaller administrative units,
01:25:05.760 reformed taxes, set maximum prices for
01:25:09.040 goods to combat inflation, and demanded
01:25:12.000 absolute loyalty to the state. He
01:25:14.400 surrounded the imperial office with
01:25:16.320 elaborate rituals, golden robes, formal
01:25:20.040 processions, kneeling courtiers. The
01:25:22.639 emperor was no longer a first citizen.
01:25:25.199 He was a distant god king. And then in
01:25:28.239 one of the most shocking acts in Roman
01:25:30.080 history, Dialesian retired in 305 CE
01:25:35.440 after ruling for over 20 years. He
01:25:38.400 stepped down
01:25:39.560 voluntarily, retreating to a palace in
01:25:42.080 what is now Croatia, where he tended his
01:25:44.800 gardens and lived out his days in peace.
01:25:47.679 When asked years later if he would
01:25:50.159 return to power, he reportedly laughed
01:25:53.040 and said, "If you could see the cabbages
01:25:55.920 I grow, you wouldn't ask me that." But
01:25:58.800 the system he built did not outlast him.
01:26:02.239 As soon as Delesian and Maximian stepped
01:26:04.639 down. The tetrarchy began to fracture.
01:26:07.679 Ambition returned. Rivals rose. Civil
01:26:10.639 war flared again. One by one, the
01:26:14.000 clament to power fell until only one
01:26:17.159 remained. The son of a Caesar, a
01:26:20.239 soldier's child, born in the east,
01:26:23.440 raised in the shadow of emperors. His
01:26:25.600 name was Constantine.
01:26:28.199 Constantine, understood power,
01:26:31.520 understood spectacle, understood belief,
01:26:34.960 and he would use all three to reshape
01:26:37.760 the empire forever. His rise was
01:26:40.159 violent. He fought rival emperors across
01:26:43.800 Europe, most famously at the Milvian
01:26:46.639 Bridge near Rome in
01:26:49.239 312 CE. On the night before battle, the
01:26:52.960 story goes he saw a vision, a cross of
01:26:56.159 light in the sky, and the words in hawk
01:26:58.560 sing no vinces. In this sign, you will
01:27:01.600 conquer. He ordered his men to paint the
01:27:04.320 Christian symbol, the chiro, on their
01:27:07.120 shields. The next day, he won. Whether
01:27:10.480 miracle or myth, the effect was real.
01:27:13.880 Constantine became the first Christian
01:27:16.400 emperor. He didn't outlaw the old gods.
01:27:19.360 Not yet. But he ended the persecution of
01:27:21.679 Christians, restored their property,
01:27:24.080 built churches. He called the Council of
01:27:26.440 Nika, the first great attempt to unify
01:27:29.840 Christian belief, and laid the
01:27:32.159 foundation for a religion that would
01:27:34.320 soon spread farther than any Roman road.
01:27:37.040 But Constantine also looked east. Not
01:27:40.960 just spiritually, but politically. Rome
01:27:43.840 was still Rome, but it was heavy with
01:27:46.080 history, crowded, vulnerable. So he
01:27:49.440 chose a new capital on the site of the
01:27:51.840 old Greek city of Bzantium. He built
01:27:54.600 Constantinople, a city of walls and
01:27:56.960 domes, baths and basilas, a new Rome for
01:28:00.320 a new world. When he died in 337 CE, he
01:28:04.719 was buried not in a pagan tomb, but in a
01:28:07.600 Christian church, surrounded by empty
01:28:10.000 coffins meant to represent the twel
01:28:12.080 apostles. He wasn't just an emperor
01:28:14.080 anymore. He was the first emperor of the
01:28:16.080 Christian Empire. Rome had been reborn.
01:28:19.120 But not everyone liked the shape it had
01:28:21.040 taken. After Constantine's death, the
01:28:24.080 empire passed to his sons, three of
01:28:26.520 them. All raised in palaces, all taught
01:28:30.159 to think of themselves as divinely
01:28:32.080 chosen. And like so many imperial
01:28:34.320 brothers before them, they quickly
01:28:36.800 turned on each other. Civil war
01:28:39.480 returned, quiet and deadly, thinning the
01:28:42.880 family tree until only Constantius II
01:28:46.000 remained. He ruled alone, a strict
01:28:49.800 administrator, pious and watchful, and
01:28:52.719 more devoted to the Christian cause than
01:28:55.360 his father had been. Pagan temples were
01:28:58.120 closed, old rituals banned, heretics
01:29:01.560 punished, even within Christianity
01:29:03.960 itself. For the first time, Rome wasn't
01:29:07.280 just tolerating a new religion. It was
01:29:10.239 shaping itself around it. Churches
01:29:12.639 replaced shrines. Bishops replaced
01:29:15.800 priests. Crosses replaced eagles. And
01:29:19.040 yet, despite it all, the heart of the
01:29:22.159 empire still beat with old blood.
01:29:24.639 Statues of Jupiter still stood.
01:29:27.600 Offerings were still made in private.
01:29:29.920 And among the courts, not everyone had
01:29:32.600 converted. One of them was Julian.
01:29:35.440 Julian was a nephew of Constantine. A
01:29:39.000 scholar, a quiet man with a restless
01:29:41.840 mind. He had watched his cousins
01:29:44.239 slaughter each other. He had seen the
01:29:46.320 empire sink into faction and fire. And
01:29:49.120 when he finally became emperor in
01:29:51.719 361 CE, he made a decision that shocked
01:29:55.600 the world. He tried to turn back the
01:29:58.239 clock. Julian rejected
01:30:01.080 Christianity. Publicly, proudly, he
01:30:04.159 revived the pagan gods, reopened
01:30:06.880 temples, called himself Pontifex Maximus
01:30:10.800 in the old sense. not to mock but to
01:30:13.840 restore. He didn't persecute Christians
01:30:16.840 violently. Not often, but he mocked
01:30:19.520 them, removed them from positions of
01:30:21.520 power, and wrote books ridiculing their
01:30:23.920 beliefs. He dreamed of a Rome returned
01:30:26.400 to its roots. To the gods of the forum,
01:30:29.520 the fires of Vesta, the hymns of Apollo.
01:30:32.560 He became known as Julian the apostate.
01:30:35.440 And then he died on campaign in Persia,
01:30:39.760 pierced by a spear. Some said it was an
01:30:42.719 enemy weapon. Others whispered it came
01:30:45.360 from one of his own men. A Christian
01:30:48.040 perhaps acting on divine instruction.
01:30:50.960 With his death, the old gods died with
01:30:53.840 him. Christianity returned harder now,
01:30:57.440 more entrenched and less forgiving.
01:31:00.480 Emperors came and went, some devout,
01:31:03.920 others pragmatic, but all lived in a
01:31:06.639 world that was changing faster than
01:31:09.040 marble could hold it together.
01:31:11.120 Barbarians were no longer at the gates.
01:31:14.400 They were inside them. Some had been
01:31:16.840 invited, hired as mercenaries, settled
01:31:20.159 as allies, others pushed through the
01:31:22.320 borders with nothing left to lose.
01:31:24.960 Climate change, famine, population
01:31:27.679 shifts in the north. Whole tribes began
01:31:30.239 moving, searching, fighting. And then in
01:31:35.480 376 CE, the Visigothths arrived. They
01:31:39.760 came seeking asylum, permission to
01:31:42.400 settle within the empire, not as
01:31:44.840 invaders, but as refugees. Rome agreed
01:31:48.960 and then exploited them. Officials
01:31:51.120 demanded bribes, starved them of food,
01:31:54.639 sold them dog meat, and the Visigoths,
01:31:57.440 furious and desperate, rebelled. In
01:32:01.800 378 CE at the battle of Adrian Opople,
01:32:05.600 they met the Roman army in the field. It
01:32:08.560 was a slaughter. The Roman Emperor
01:32:10.560 Valins was killed. His army was
01:32:13.080 annihilated. The Eastern Legions had
01:32:15.440 never suffered such a defeat. It wasn't
01:32:17.920 just a military loss. It was a
01:32:20.400 psychological one. For the first time in
01:32:23.239 centuries, Rome had faced a foreign
01:32:25.520 army. Not on the frontier, but deep
01:32:28.320 inside its own land and lost everything.
01:32:31.600 From that moment, the decline wasn't
01:32:34.159 theoretical anymore. It was visible,
01:32:36.800 tangible. The empire didn't fall in a
01:32:39.199 day, but it began to bend in ways it
01:32:41.679 never had before. And still, somehow, it
01:32:45.360 kept going. Rome had always imagined
01:32:47.679 itself as eternal. Even when battered,
01:32:51.040 even when burning, it still whispered to
01:32:53.920 itself that it would endure forever. But
01:32:56.800 after Adrian Opople, that illusion was
01:32:59.520 harder to hold. The Visigothths, no
01:33:02.639 longer refugees, were now a force inside
01:33:05.760 the empire. They couldn't be driven out,
01:33:08.480 so they were bargained with, bribed,
01:33:12.080 given land, and slowly other groups
01:33:15.520 followed. Vandals, Alans, Subie. Rome
01:33:20.000 was no longer defending its borders. It
01:33:22.800 was managing an invasion in slow motion.
01:33:25.520 Emperors came and went, some capable,
01:33:28.800 most irrelevant. The empire was still
01:33:31.280 technically whole, but in practice it
01:33:34.159 was splitting. The west grew weaker,
01:33:37.080 poorer. Cities crumbled, roads decayed.
01:33:40.960 The army, once a proud machine of Roman
01:33:43.679 discipline, now relied heavily on
01:33:45.920 barbarian troops. Men who spoke other
01:33:49.000 languages, followed other customs, and
01:33:51.840 owed their loyalty not to Rome itself,
01:33:54.639 but to their generals. In 395 CE,
01:33:58.719 Emperor Theodosius, the last man to rule
01:34:01.840 both east and west, died. He left the
01:34:04.880 empire to his two sons, dividing it once
01:34:07.840 and for all. The Eastern Empire,
01:34:10.400 centered in Constantinople, would
01:34:12.639 survive. The Western Empire would not.
01:34:16.000 Into this fractured world, came a man
01:34:18.639 named Allaric. He was a Visigoth, raised
01:34:22.159 inside the empire, trained by Roman
01:34:25.320 commanders, baptized as a Christian, but
01:34:28.400 always treated as less than Roman. When
01:34:30.719 Theodosius died, Allaric led his men in
01:34:34.000 revolt, demanding better treatment,
01:34:36.719 land, recognition. He marched on Italy.
01:34:40.239 The Romans refused to negotiate. So
01:34:42.960 Allaric did the unthinkable. He marched
01:34:45.600 on Rome itself. The eternal city hadn't
01:34:48.560 been attacked in over 800 years. Even
01:34:51.360 during the worst civil wars, the city
01:34:53.920 had remained untouched. Like a sacred
01:34:56.480 heart, protected by distance and
01:34:58.560 history. But in 410
01:35:01.239 CE, Allaric's forces surrounded it. Rome
01:35:04.880 starved, plays were sent, bribes
01:35:08.320 offered, gates opened, and for 3 days
01:35:12.800 Rome was sacked, temples were looted,
01:35:16.159 homes burned, churches spared, perhaps
01:35:19.920 out of respect, perhaps out of
01:35:22.600 calculation. But the symbol was
01:35:24.480 shattered. Rome, the city of emperors,
01:35:28.080 of Caesars, of gods, had been breached.
01:35:32.560 People fled. Some
01:35:34.600 wept. Others refused to believe it. St.
01:35:37.880 Jerome, writing from Bethlehem, said,
01:35:41.679 "If Rome can perish, what can be safe?"
01:35:45.120 Allaric didn't stay. His goal had never
01:35:48.000 been to destroy Rome. He wanted a place
01:35:50.480 for his people, not revenge. But he died
01:35:54.480 shortly after suddenly and was buried
01:35:57.440 beneath a riverbed. His grave hidden by
01:36:00.400 slaves who were then killed to keep it
01:36:02.880 secret. A ghost of conquest. Meanwhile,
01:36:06.080 the empire staged on. Other tribes
01:36:08.400 carved out kingdoms in Gaul and Spain in
01:36:11.280 North Africa. The Vandals seized
01:36:13.760 Carthage and built a navy, turning
01:36:16.320 pirates into kings. They would later
01:36:18.400 sack Rome again in 455.
01:36:22.239 worse this time, more thorough, even
01:36:25.199 carrying off the empress. The word
01:36:27.199 vandal would be born from that moment.
01:36:29.600 But the real power behind the throne in
01:36:31.600 these years wasn't the emperor. It was a
01:36:34.560 general. His name was Flavius Atus, a
01:36:38.239 Roman by name, but raised among
01:36:40.440 barbarians. He knew how to
01:36:42.840 negotiate, how to fight, how to survive.
01:36:46.800 He kept the west alive barely with
01:36:50.080 alliances and diplomacy. And when a new
01:36:52.719 threat emerged, a thunder rolling in
01:36:55.520 from the east, it was a teas who stood
01:36:58.320 in its way. That threat was Ailla, the
01:37:01.679 scourge of God. Ailla didn't look like
01:37:03.920 the Romans idea of a conqueror. He
01:37:06.639 didn't wear purple, didn't quote Virgil,
01:37:09.600 didn't write laws or commission temples.
01:37:12.159 He wore plain clothes, rode everywhere,
01:37:14.960 ate simple meals. But when he rode into
01:37:17.719 battle, whole nations flinched. The Huns
01:37:21.199 were unlike anything Rome had faced.
01:37:23.600 They weren't just another Germanic
01:37:25.199 tribe. They were fast, brutal,
01:37:28.760 unpredictable. Expert horsemen who moved
01:37:31.280 like shadows and struck like fire. They
01:37:33.840 didn't siege cities. They crushed them.
01:37:36.880 Attilla ruled them all. Not just as a
01:37:39.360 warlord, but as a symbol. In him, they
01:37:42.800 saw a destiny. In him, Rome saw an
01:37:45.840 ending. In the early 440, yes, he
01:37:49.280 stormed across the Balkans, attacking
01:37:51.520 cities that had stood for centuries.
01:37:54.199 Constantinople trembled, but the Great
01:37:56.719 Walls held. Attilla pulled back and
01:37:59.679 turned west. In 451 CE, he invaded Gaul.
01:38:04.960 City after city fell. The old Roman
01:38:07.760 roads now carried foreign boots. The
01:38:10.560 empire's armies weakened and scattered
01:38:13.600 could do little. But Flavius Atus, the
01:38:17.440 Roman general with barbarian blood,
01:38:19.920 pulled together an alliance. Romans,
01:38:23.239 Visigothths, Franks, old enemies
01:38:26.000 fighting together for survival. They met
01:38:28.080 Ailla at the Catalanian plains. The
01:38:31.280 battle was vast, bloody, confusing.
01:38:35.000 Atias commanding his coalition managed
01:38:38.480 to halt the Huns. It wasn't a complete
01:38:41.040 victory, but it was enough. Attilla
01:38:43.679 withdrew. For the first time, he had
01:38:46.320 been stopped. But he wasn't done. The
01:38:48.880 next year,
01:38:51.320 452, Attilla invaded Italy. Cities
01:38:54.560 burned. Refugees fled south. Rome itself
01:38:58.440 waited. Terrified. Exposed, Artitius
01:39:02.719 couldn't stop him this time. The army
01:39:05.119 was exhausted. The coffers were empty.
01:39:08.639 And then something strange happened. A
01:39:11.360 delegation from Rome, including Pope Leo
01:39:14.239 the Bren, rode out to meet Ailla. No
01:39:17.440 army, just words. No one knows exactly
01:39:21.040 what was said. Some say Leo warned
01:39:23.400 Attilla that he would face divine wrath
01:39:26.320 if he attacked the holy city. Others say
01:39:29.040 the emperor offered bribes, land, a
01:39:32.800 wife. Whatever the reason, Attilla
01:39:35.679 turned back. Rome was spared again. The
01:39:38.719 city exhaled, not from strength, but
01:39:42.239 mercy. Attilla died a year later.
01:39:45.800 Suddenly, perhaps from a burst blood
01:39:48.320 vessel on his wedding night, or from
01:39:50.880 poison, or from his own excess, his
01:39:53.679 empire collapsed almost immediately. The
01:39:57.280 Huns scattered. Their threat was gone.
01:40:00.159 But so too was Rome's last chance to
01:40:02.880 stand tall. Batius, the hero of Gaul,
01:40:07.360 was murdered by the emperor Valentinian
01:40:10.119 III. Stabbed in the palace out of
01:40:12.719 jealousy or fear. Months later,
01:40:15.679 Valentinian was killed by Atus's former
01:40:19.560 bodyguards. No trial, no order, just
01:40:23.040 death. The Western Roman Empire had no
01:40:26.760 plan, no center. It had become a hollow
01:40:30.280 name. Held up by weak emperors and even
01:40:33.360 weaker hopes. Puppet rulers were
01:40:35.840 installed by barbarian generals. The
01:40:38.719 city of Rome itself no longer mattered
01:40:41.679 much. The real power was in Ravena or
01:40:45.199 Milan or wherever the sword happened to
01:40:47.760 be. And then in
01:40:49.800 476 CE, it ended. The last western
01:40:54.480 emperor was a boy. Romulus Aostilus, a
01:40:58.719 child emperor, with a name that echoed
01:41:01.520 the very beginning of Rome. Romulus the
01:41:04.159 founder, Augustus, the first true
01:41:06.760 emperor. A name built from greatness.
01:41:10.000 But the world had moved on. A Germanic
01:41:12.560 general named
01:41:14.520 Odoasa deposed the boy. He didn't kill
01:41:17.440 him, just sent him into retirement with
01:41:19.679 a pension and a villa. Then he sent the
01:41:22.159 imperial regalia, the crown, the purple
01:41:25.600 cloak, the scepter to Constantinople
01:41:29.199 with a simple message. We don't need an
01:41:31.679 emperor in the west anymore. No last
01:41:34.440 stand, no fiery collapse, just silence.
01:41:39.040 And so the Western Roman Empire ended,
01:41:41.840 not with a roar, but with a shrug. When
01:41:44.639 the Western Roman Empire fell in
01:41:48.280 476, it didn't feel like the end of
01:41:50.960 Rome, not completely. The city still
01:41:54.000 stood, though bruised. Its people still
01:41:57.360 walked under arches, built by emperors.
01:42:00.719 Latin was still spoken. Laws still
01:42:03.440 followed Roman structure. And in the
01:42:05.679 East, in Constantinople, the empire
01:42:08.800 still lived. The Eastern Roman Empire,
01:42:11.760 what we now call the Byzantine Empire,
01:42:14.159 had always seen itself as the true Rome.
01:42:16.719 It had wealth. It had a navy. It had
01:42:20.239 cities that still thrived and walls that
01:42:23.199 hadn't fallen. And it had an emperor.
01:42:25.840 While the West fragmented into kingdoms
01:42:28.159 and warlords, the East endured, and it
01:42:30.800 didn't just endure, it flourished. Over
01:42:33.840 time, its culture began to shift. Greek
01:42:37.119 became the dominant language. Eastern
01:42:39.600 Christianity took root, shaping
01:42:41.960 theology, art, and architecture. But the
01:42:44.880 memory of Rome never left. It lived in
01:42:47.600 law, in titles, in ambition. And nowhere
01:42:51.679 was that ambition greater than in the
01:42:54.480 man who would try to restore the entire
01:42:56.560 Roman world. Justinian. Justinian was
01:43:00.480 born in the
01:43:01.560 Balkans, a peasant son who rose through
01:43:04.320 the ranks. thanks to an uncle in the
01:43:06.960 imperial court. He wasn't charming. He
01:43:10.239 wasn't a soldier. But he was brilliant,
01:43:13.880 tireless, obsessed with legacy. When he
01:43:16.719 became emperor in
01:43:18.920 527, he had one goal to rebuild the
01:43:21.840 Roman Empire. Not just in spirit, but in
01:43:25.360 stone and sword. His reign was filled
01:43:27.840 with contradictions.
01:43:29.920 glory and disaster, brilliance and
01:43:32.440 cruelty, victories won and quickly lost.
01:43:35.679 But there's no doubt he left a mark few
01:43:38.159 others ever did. He began with law. He
01:43:40.960 ordered
01:43:41.960 scholars to collect, revise, and compile
01:43:45.199 all Roman legal writings into one
01:43:48.400 unified code. The result, the corpus
01:43:51.760 jurist civilis, the body of civil law.
01:43:55.119 It would influence legal systems for
01:43:57.159 centuries, shaping Europe long after his
01:43:59.760 empire had turned to dust. Then came his
01:44:02.400 most famous
01:44:03.560 legacy, architecture. He rebuilt
01:44:07.159 Constantinople after a massive riot
01:44:09.520 nearly burned it to the ground. And in
01:44:11.840 its heart, he raised a monument that
01:44:14.080 still stuns the world. the Hagia Sophia,
01:44:17.920 a vast cathedral with a dome that seemed
01:44:20.560 to float on light like heaven pressed
01:44:23.520 downward onto stone. When it was
01:44:25.679 finished, he stood beneath it and
01:44:28.159 whispered, "Solomon, I have surpassed
01:44:30.960 you." But Justinian was not alone. By
01:44:34.239 his side was
01:44:36.280 Theodora, his wife, his co-ruler, his
01:44:40.080 equal. She had once been an actress, a
01:44:42.960 woman of low status in the eyes of
01:44:45.520 polite society, but she was sharp,
01:44:48.239 fierce, political during the Nika riots
01:44:51.679 when mobs filled the streets and
01:44:53.920 Justinian considered fleeing the city.
01:44:57.040 Theodora is said to have stopped him
01:44:58.800 cold. Purple, she said, is a fine color
01:45:02.239 for a burial shroud. He stayed, ordered
01:45:05.119 the rebellion crushed, and thousands
01:45:07.600 were slaughtered in the Hippodromeome.
01:45:09.520 The city was saved, the throne secure,
01:45:13.280 and with order
01:45:14.679 restored. Justinian turned to conquest,
01:45:18.159 he sent his most trusted general,
01:45:21.400 Belisarius, westward, first to North
01:45:24.119 Africa to defeat the Vandals, then to
01:45:27.199 Italy, where the Ostrogoths had made
01:45:30.080 themselves kings. City by city,
01:45:33.119 Belisarius retook lands once held by
01:45:36.159 Rome. Carthage, Naples, Rome itself.
01:45:40.800 Rovena. For a moment, it seemed like the
01:45:43.679 dream might come true. The Roman Empire
01:45:47.159 reborn. But war is never that clean. The
01:45:50.719 campaigns dragged on, resources drained,
01:45:54.159 plagues swept through the empire,
01:45:56.480 killing millions, including much of
01:45:58.239 Justinian's court. The very air seemed
01:46:01.040 cursed. And though victories were won,
01:46:03.840 they never lasted long. Rebellions broke
01:46:06.400 out. New enemies emerged. The borders
01:46:09.440 were too vast, the treasury too thin.
01:46:12.960 Belisarius, loyal to the end, was
01:46:15.400 recalled. Disgraced and later quietly
01:46:19.239 reinstated. A soldier's fate worn thin
01:46:22.239 by glory. Justinian ruled for nearly 40
01:46:25.880 years. When he died in
01:46:29.239 565, he left behind a stronger empire
01:46:33.119 and a fractured one. His dream of
01:46:35.360 restoration had burned bright, but the
01:46:38.639 world had moved on. Rome was now memory,
01:46:41.679 but
01:46:42.679 Constantinople still stood. Justinian's
01:46:45.520 death left a vacuum. No one could truly
01:46:49.119 fill. His empire was still large from
01:46:52.159 the edge of Spain to the border of
01:46:53.840 Persia. But it was stretched, fragile,
01:46:57.520 held together more by memory than
01:46:59.520 muscle. The western conquests were
01:47:01.920 already slipping. Italy fell into chaos.
01:47:04.719 The Lombards, a new Germanic tribe,
01:47:07.920 swept in from the north, carving out
01:47:10.400 their own kingdom. Rome itself became a
01:47:12.960 ghost. Its glory whispered only in
01:47:15.520 churches and ruins. In the east, the
01:47:18.159 Persians pressed harder. Their empire
01:47:21.080 resurgent, sharper, more dangerous than
01:47:24.000 before. But Bzantium, as the Eastern
01:47:26.719 Roman Empire slowly began to be called,
01:47:29.520 adapted. It always adapted. The emperors
01:47:32.320 who followed Justinian weren't builders.
01:47:35.119 They were survivors, bureaucrats,
01:47:37.679 warriors. Some noble, some monstrous, a
01:47:40.800 few both. One of them,
01:47:43.400 Heraclus, would be remembered not for
01:47:46.159 what he built, but for what he endured.
01:47:49.360 When he took the throne in
01:47:51.480 610, the empire was under siege. The
01:47:54.719 Persians had taken Jerusalem, stolen the
01:47:57.840 true cross, and marched deep into
01:48:00.320 imperial lands. The Avars, Slavs, and
01:48:03.960 Bulgars were raiding from the north.
01:48:06.840 Constantinople was surrounded. The
01:48:09.280 treasury was empty. Heraclus sold church
01:48:12.639 treasures to pay his armies. He
01:48:15.360 reorganized the empire's military
01:48:17.639 districts. A system called themes,
01:48:20.639 turning provinces into semi-aututonomous
01:48:23.040 zones that could defend
01:48:25.320 themselves. It was desperate. It was
01:48:28.440 brilliant. He didn't wait for the enemy
01:48:30.800 to come. He marched east across Anatolia
01:48:34.880 into Persian heartlands. In
01:48:38.360 627 at the Battle of Nineveh, he won.
01:48:41.760 Not just a victory, the victory. The
01:48:44.880 Persians collapsed into civil war. The
01:48:47.679 stolen relics were returned. The Eastern
01:48:50.320 Empire for a brief moment breathed
01:48:53.440 again. And then the world changed. In
01:48:57.199 the Arabian desert, a prophet named
01:48:59.719 Muhammad had begun receiving revelations
01:49:02.880 within a few decades of his death. His
01:49:05.760 followers united, driven, fierce,
01:49:08.960 exploded outward. The Islamic caliphate
01:49:11.520 conquered Persia entirely. Then Syria,
01:49:14.960 then Egypt, then North Africa. Lands
01:49:18.400 that had been Roman for centuries were
01:49:20.800 lost in years. Cities that once echoed
01:49:23.199 Latin now called out prayers in Arabic.
01:49:26.239 The empire fought back. Sometimes it
01:49:28.560 won. But the tide had shifted. Bzantium
01:49:31.360 was no longer an empire of conquest. It
01:49:33.760 was a fortress. By the 700s, the empire
01:49:37.920 was smaller, poorer, but harder. The
01:49:41.199 emperors had traded marble for stone,
01:49:43.600 poetry for policy. They ruled from
01:49:46.520 Constantinople behind its triple walls
01:49:49.199 beneath the shadow of the Haga Sophia.
01:49:51.679 The city became more than a capital. It
01:49:54.320 became a symbol, a myth made real. It
01:49:57.119 had been besieged by Persians, Arabs,
01:50:00.480 Bulgars, even fellow Christians, and it
01:50:03.440 had survived. Once an Arab fleet
01:50:05.920 surrounded the city, the emperor
01:50:07.920 responded with a secret weapon, Greek
01:50:10.320 fire. A mysterious liquid flame that
01:50:12.960 burned on water, clinging to ships and
01:50:15.679 spreading panic. It turned the tide. The
01:50:18.480 Empire lived, but
01:50:20.679 inside, change was still coming. One
01:50:23.760 emperor, Leo III, launched the
01:50:27.000 iconoclasm, a movement to destroy
01:50:29.360 religious images. He claimed they were
01:50:32.760 idolatrous, that they brought defeat and
01:50:35.360 disorder, mosaics were smashed, fresco
01:50:39.320 whitewashed, monks beaten or exiled. It
01:50:44.000 split the church, east against west,
01:50:47.760 pope against patriarch. Even when icons
01:50:50.639 were restored years later, the scars
01:50:53.719 remained. And across the
01:50:56.280 Adriatic Inestern lands, something
01:51:00.320 strange was growing. A new emperor, not
01:51:03.600 Roman, not Eastern, but crowned by the
01:51:06.400 Pope in Rome itself. His name was
01:51:10.159 Charlemagne. In the year 800, on
01:51:14.080 Christmas Day, the Pope placed a crown
01:51:16.880 on the head of a tall, broadshouldered
01:51:19.760 Frankish king named Charlemagne and
01:51:22.560 declared him emperor of the Romans. The
01:51:25.360 ceremony took place in St. Peter's
01:51:27.560 Basilica in Rome, not Constantinople,
01:51:31.119 not by the will of a Roman Senate or a
01:51:33.280 Roman army, but by a pope seeking to
01:51:36.080 forge something new. The title was old.
01:51:38.800 The symbolism was heavy. But the message
01:51:41.119 was clear in the eyes of the Latin West.
01:51:44.159 The Roman Empire didn't just still
01:51:45.920 exist. It had been reborn in the body of
01:51:48.880 a Germanic king. The Byzantines were
01:51:51.280 outraged. To them, Charlemagne was a
01:51:54.000 barbarian with a fancy sword and no
01:51:56.719 claim to their legacy. They still ruled
01:51:59.040 from Constantinople. They still bore the
01:52:01.679 imperial seals. They were the true
01:52:03.679 Romans. But the West didn't see it that
01:52:05.920 way anymore. This moment, grand and
01:52:09.639 strange, marked the deepening of a split
01:52:12.480 that had been forming for centuries.
01:52:14.960 Language was different now. Latin in the
01:52:17.639 west, Greek in the east. Beliefs were
01:52:20.719 drifting. The papacy grew more powerful.
01:52:24.840 independent doctrinal disputes festered
01:52:28.639 about the nature of Christ, about icons,
01:52:32.000 about bread and words, and where the
01:52:34.560 true authority of the church lived. The
01:52:36.960 east had
01:52:38.040 patriarchs, the west had a pope. Each
01:52:40.880 side believed they were the heart of
01:52:43.480 Christianity. Neither was willing to
01:52:45.520 bow. In
01:52:47.239 1054, it broke. The great schism. The
01:52:50.960 Pope and the Patriarch excommunicated
01:52:54.080 each other. A thousand years of shared
01:52:56.599 faith split by a single word in a creed
01:53:00.480 and centuries of pride. Meanwhile,
01:53:04.040 Bzantium, still calling itself the Roman
01:53:06.920 Empire, pressed on. It had survived
01:53:10.280 invasions, fire, plague, civil wars, but
01:53:14.960 it had also lost much. Egypt gone, Syria
01:53:19.679 gone. The old heartlands of Roman power
01:53:22.639 now belong to new caliphates. But the
01:53:25.119 empire adapted again. Emperors like
01:53:27.440 Basil II, the Bulgar Slayer, pushed
01:53:30.719 back, carving new borders. The Byzantine
01:53:33.360 army became a blend of native troops and
01:53:36.480 foreign mercenaries. The treasury was
01:53:38.719 filled and emptied again. One moment
01:53:41.360 rich in silk, the next stretched thin by
01:53:44.080 corruption or invasion. Constantinople
01:53:46.560 remained the jewel. the largest, most
01:53:49.520 sophisticated city in Europe with public
01:53:52.480 baths, paved streets, and a skyline that
01:53:55.760 shimmerred in the sun. But power was
01:53:57.960 shifting. To the north, the Slavs had
01:54:01.040 formed new kingdoms. To the west, the
01:54:04.560 German emperors of the Holy Roman Empire
01:54:07.440 claimed a title, but not the legacy. And
01:54:10.320 in 1095, the Pope Urban II made a call,
01:54:15.440 a call that would change Bzantium
01:54:17.440 forever. He asked the knights of Europe
01:54:19.760 to take up the cross, to travel east,
01:54:22.719 and to reclaim the Holy Land from Muslim
01:54:24.880 control. The first crusade had begun.
01:54:28.159 The Byzantines watched it unfold with
01:54:31.480 unease. These weren't Roman legions.
01:54:34.159 These were armored nobles bound by oaths
01:54:37.599 and pride, speaking strange tongues and
01:54:41.840 praying in unfamiliar ways. When the
01:54:44.239 crusaders arrived in
01:54:45.960 Constantinople, they marveled at its
01:54:48.360 beauty and coveted it. Though they
01:54:51.040 passed through peacefully the first
01:54:52.800 time, the memory lingered. Two centuries
01:54:56.000 later in 1204, the fourth crusade,
01:55:00.639 originally aimed at Egypt, was diverted
01:55:04.000 through politics, betrayal, and greed.
01:55:07.920 The crusaders attacked Constantinople
01:55:10.560 itself. They sacked the city. They
01:55:13.520 burned libraries, desecrated churches,
01:55:16.400 melted down statues. They stole
01:55:18.560 everything not nailed down, and even
01:55:21.280 some things that were. It was the first
01:55:23.440 time
01:55:24.599 Constantinople had ever fallen. The
01:55:27.119 empire was shattered not by Huns, not by
01:55:30.440 Huns, not by Arabs, but by fellow
01:55:33.520 Christians, Latin knights. For 50 years,
01:55:37.040 Bzantium was a puppet ruled by Western
01:55:40.080 lords. But in
01:55:42.119 1261, a Byzantine prince, Michael VI
01:55:46.199 Pialos, reclaimed the city. He rode
01:55:49.040 through its battered gates and restored
01:55:51.360 the empire or tried to. The truth was it
01:55:54.960 was never the same again. The Rome of
01:55:57.199 the East had been mortally wounded. It
01:55:59.760 just didn't not know it yet. By the time
01:56:01.760 the Byzantines reclaimed
01:56:03.800 Constantinople in
01:56:05.800 1261, it was not the city Justinian had
01:56:08.639 ruled. The great markets were quiet, the
01:56:11.440 aqueducts dry in places, the churches
01:56:14.320 scarred, the once mighty empire now
01:56:17.199 stretched only across slivers of Greece.
01:56:20.239 Pockets of Anatolia and a coastline held
01:56:23.440 more by tradition than strength. The
01:56:25.599 treasury was empty, the army, a shadow.
01:56:29.440 Still, the emperors of the Paleolos
01:56:32.639 dynasty clung to their titles. They
01:56:35.360 spoke of Rome, of Caesar, of divine
01:56:38.719 right and ancient glories. But their
01:56:41.280 empire was a memory surviving on
01:56:43.920 borrowed time, and time was running out.
01:56:47.040 To the east, a new power was rising,
01:56:50.159 fierce, organized, patient, the Ottoman
01:56:53.760 Turks. They had swept across Anatolia,
01:56:56.880 absorbing weakened Seljuk states and
01:56:59.440 pushing against Byzantine fortresses.
01:57:02.000 One by one, cities fell. Lands lost for
01:57:05.520 centuries were now permanently gone. The
01:57:08.080 Byzantines begged the West for help. But
01:57:10.960 the West was tired. The Crusades were
01:57:13.520 over. The Pope was ignored. And in the
01:57:16.159 North, new wars had captured Europe's
01:57:18.840 attention. In
01:57:20.840 1347, plague returned. The Black Death
01:57:23.920 swept through the empire like a dark
01:57:26.320 wind, killing not thousands, but
01:57:28.800 millions. It reached
01:57:30.920 Constantinople and turned its streets to
01:57:33.440 silence. Corpses piled in alleys.
01:57:36.639 Priests collapsed midsmon. Even the
01:57:39.520 healthy gave up hope. The empire,
01:57:42.239 already weakened, was now coughing in
01:57:44.960 the dark, waiting for someone to blow
01:57:47.280 out the last candle. But it didn't fall.
01:57:50.000 Not yet. It endured through civil wars,
01:57:53.119 dynastic struggles, and impossible odds.
01:57:56.159 The emperors pawned relics to pay
01:57:58.800 soldiers. They married off daughters to
01:58:01.599 powerful neighbors. They wrote letters,
01:58:04.440 treaties, prayers. And in
01:58:07.320 1453, it happened. The Ottomans came.
01:58:11.360 Sultan
01:58:12.440 Mehmed II, young, brilliant, and
01:58:16.800 absolutely determined, brought an army
01:58:19.599 of tens of thousands. He surrounded
01:58:22.159 Constantinople with cannon the likes of
01:58:25.199 which the world had never seen. One
01:58:27.920 called the Basilica was so large it took
01:58:30.960 weeks to move and hours to reload. The
01:58:33.920 Byzantines had perhaps 7,000 men. Their
01:58:37.199 walls were strong but old. Their
01:58:39.520 defenders brave but few. For 53 days the
01:58:43.760 city held day and night. The cannons
01:58:46.960 roared. The ground shook. The walls
01:58:50.199 cracked. Still the defenders repaired.
01:58:53.679 They fought with Greek fire, with
01:58:55.840 arrows, with boiling oil. The emperor,
01:58:59.199 Constantine 11, fought among them, not
01:59:02.320 in gold, but in armor, sword in hand. He
01:59:06.000 refused to leave. "I will not abandon
01:59:08.880 the city," he said. "I will die with my
01:59:11.920 people." On May 29th,
01:59:15.480 1453, the walls finally fell. The
01:59:18.800 Ottomans surged in. The final emperor
01:59:21.440 was last seen fighting in the streets,
01:59:24.159 disappearing into legend. The city
01:59:26.480 burned and wept and changed forever.
01:59:29.440 Hagia Sophia, the crown of Christendom,
01:59:33.360 became a mosque. The gates were closed
01:59:36.400 and the Roman Empire born on the banks
01:59:39.440 of the Tyber raised in marble, crowned
01:59:42.639 in Constantinople, was no more. But
01:59:45.880 perhaps not entirely. Because empires
01:59:49.360 don't too who really die. Not like that.
01:59:52.400 They echo in law, in language, in the
01:59:56.080 shape of cities, in dreams. The Roman
01:59:59.760 eagle was lowered. Yes, but its wings
02:00:03.520 never fully folded. Rome was gone, but
02:00:06.800 Rome was everywhere. The fall of
02:00:09.400 Constantinople in
02:00:11.880 1453 marked the end of the Roman Empire
02:00:14.719 in name. But in truth, Rome had already
02:00:17.760 passed into something else. Not a
02:00:20.320 government, not a city, but an
02:00:22.920 inheritance. For centuries, rulers
02:00:25.199 across Europe would claim its mantle.
02:00:27.760 They called themselves Caesars,
02:00:30.239 defenders of Rome. The Holy Roman
02:00:32.560 Empire, a strange lumbering creation
02:00:35.760 born in the West, would survive for
02:00:38.159 another 350 years after Byzantium fell.
02:00:41.520 It was never truly Roman. It wasn't even
02:00:44.239 centered in Rome. But the name mattered.
02:00:46.800 It carried weight. Popes crowned
02:00:49.119 emperors. Emperors fought popes. And
02:00:51.840 through it all, the word Rome sat at the
02:00:54.320 center like a ghost, never fully seen,
02:00:57.360 but always there. In Russia, the SARS,
02:01:00.719 the word itself, a corruption of Caesar,
02:01:03.679 claimed to be the third Rome. After the
02:01:05.920 fall of the first and the second, Moscow
02:01:08.560 would inherit the crown, they said. And
02:01:11.040 for a while people believed it. Even the
02:01:13.599 Ottomans who had conquered
02:01:15.320 Constantinople saw themselves not just
02:01:17.599 as sultanss but as heirs. Mehmed II
02:01:21.280 declared himself Caesar of Rome,
02:01:23.360 protector of all the lands once ruled by
02:01:25.520 the empire. He rebuilt the city,
02:01:28.000 repopulated it, protected its churches.
02:01:30.960 He didn't erase its memory. He claimed
02:01:33.360 it. And what of the city itself? Rome,
02:01:36.719 the city by the Tyber, still stood older
02:01:40.480 than its ruins, quieter than its
02:01:43.320 legends. Its temples became churches,
02:01:47.040 its forums, open air museums. The
02:01:50.239 coliseum was stripped for stone, the
02:01:52.960 aqueducts dried and were reborn. But
02:01:56.000 even as the empire faded, the city
02:01:58.400 remained a pilgrimage for popes, for
02:02:01.560 artists, for dreamers. During the
02:02:04.599 Renaissance, Rome lived again, not as a
02:02:07.520 capital of conquest, but as the cradle
02:02:10.000 of memory. Michelangelo painted in its
02:02:13.159 chapels. Poets walked its broken roads.
02:02:16.719 Scholars studied Latin as if it still
02:02:19.199 breathed, and in their way it did. The
02:02:22.400 laws of Rome, codified by Justinian,
02:02:26.080 refined by centuries, became the
02:02:28.800 foundation for modern legal systems.
02:02:32.360 property, contracts,
02:02:35.239 citizenship, ideas born in Roman courts
02:02:38.719 now define nations. Latin once spoken in
02:02:42.320 the forum became the root of French,
02:02:45.239 Spanish, Italian, Romanian, and
02:02:48.480 Portuguese. You can still hear it if you
02:02:51.040 listen closely. In every courtroom, in
02:02:53.760 every university motto, even in the
02:02:56.080 stars, Mars, Jupiter, Venus, the gods of
02:03:00.480 old Rome now orbit the Earth, not as
02:03:03.440 deities, but as destinations. Rome had
02:03:06.639 once named the heavens. And now even in
02:03:09.920 space its language lingers. Even the
02:03:13.560 republic that fragile idea born
02:03:16.800 centuries before Caesar crossed the
02:03:19.639 rubicum found new voice in America in
02:03:24.760 constitutions, senates and civic virtue.
02:03:28.400 The founding fathers of the United
02:03:30.000 States read Roman histories like
02:03:32.199 scripture. Catatus became a model for
02:03:35.040 George Washington. The Roman eagle was
02:03:37.760 carved onto new flags. A republic
02:03:41.440 reborn, or so they hoped. But no
02:03:44.840 republic, no matter how noble, ever
02:03:48.159 truly escapes the questions Rome left
02:03:51.000 behind. How do you protect freedom and
02:03:54.639 keep order? How do you give power and
02:03:57.679 prevent abuse? How do you endure? Rome's
02:04:00.639 shadow stretched long across time, even
02:04:03.920 in places it never ruled. Its memory
02:04:06.800 shaped ambition. Napoleon crowned
02:04:09.040 himself emperor, not just of France, but
02:04:12.639 an imitation of Caesar. He stood beneath
02:04:15.199 arches that had once echoed with Latin
02:04:18.080 and claimed them as his own. He adopted
02:04:20.400 Roman symbols, Roman titles, Roman
02:04:24.280 pride. Even as he brought war to the
02:04:26.960 same lands Rome once claimed. And when
02:04:29.840 Napoleon fell, the memory remained.
02:04:32.480 Hitler's third Reich claimed to be the
02:04:34.719 third Rome after the first and the Holy
02:04:37.679 Roman Empire. He surrounded himself with
02:04:40.320 Roman architecture. Drew on the language
02:04:43.119 of legions wore eagles on his banners.
02:04:45.840 It was not admiration. It was
02:04:48.360 appropriation. A legacy misused. A myth
02:04:51.719 distorted. But that is what happens to
02:04:54.320 myths. They outlive the truth. They
02:04:57.040 become whatever those in power need them
02:04:59.040 to be. And still the real Rome, the one
02:05:03.280 that grew from seven hills and spread
02:05:05.440 like a wildfire, lingers in quieter
02:05:08.400 places, in road signs, in languages, in
02:05:12.080 coins and calendars and courthouse
02:05:15.040 steps, in the shape of government, the
02:05:18.000 structure of armies, the ring of a word
02:05:21.119 like senator. Rome became something more
02:05:23.760 than a place. It became a pattern, a
02:05:27.320 template, a warning.
02:05:29.760 a dream. And for those who lived through
02:05:32.159 it, the real Rome, it was never one
02:05:35.760 thing. It was a shifting tapestry of
02:05:38.840 contradictions. It gave the world law
02:05:41.040 and order and crucifixion and conquest.
02:05:44.560 It built roads to connect people and
02:05:47.520 legions to control them. It offered
02:05:49.880 citizenship, then slavery. It preached
02:05:52.800 tolerance, then burned books. It brought
02:05:56.080 civilization to the frontier and
02:05:58.719 destroyed entire cultures to do it. To
02:06:01.280 love Rome is to live in tension. To
02:06:04.159 understand it is to sit with the
02:06:06.280 complexity. To accept that greatness and
02:06:09.080 cruelty often share a skin. That marble
02:06:12.400 can shine even as blood pools beneath
02:06:15.040 it. And still people return. Tourists
02:06:18.320 walk through the forum not realizing
02:06:20.560 they stand where senators once plotted
02:06:23.040 against Caesar. School children toss
02:06:25.199 coins into the Trevy Fountain without
02:06:27.920 knowing how many emperors bled to
02:06:29.920 control the aqueducts that feed it.
02:06:32.079 Lovers photograph the coliseum, not
02:06:35.119 hearing the echoes of animals and
02:06:36.800 applause and men who died beneath the
02:06:38.960 sand. But that's the thing about Rome.
02:06:41.280 It doesn't need you to remember it
02:06:42.880 completely. It only needs you to feel
02:06:45.119 it. And somehow we all do. In every
02:06:48.320 republic that fears a tyrant. In every
02:06:50.800 builder who dreams in stone. In every
02:06:53.280 law passed. In every oath sworn. In
02:06:57.360 every civilization that hopes to last
02:06:59.840 longer than the century that bore it.
02:07:02.159 Because Rome more than anything was a
02:07:05.280 story told again and again,
02:07:08.599 revised, retold, reinvented, not just in
02:07:12.480 Latin, but in every language it touched.
02:07:15.280 And stories, as long as we speak them,
02:07:18.400 never truly end. Sometimes to understand
02:07:21.119 the empire, you have to forget the
02:07:24.119 statues, forget the gods, forget the
02:07:27.360 maps and battles and marble columns, you
02:07:30.560 have to remember the people, the ones
02:07:32.960 who never made it into books, who never
02:07:35.840 wore purple or plotted in the Senate,
02:07:39.280 the farmers who dug in dry earth just
02:07:42.000 outside the city. The mother who lost
02:07:44.480 her sons to the legions year after year.
02:07:48.000 The scribe who copied a law he couldn't
02:07:50.800 read. The slave who never saw his home
02:07:53.520 again but taught a Roman child to read.
02:07:57.119 They built the empire brick by brick,
02:08:00.400 word by word. Not for glory but for
02:08:03.760 survival, for bread, for family. We
02:08:06.960 remember the emperors. We speak their
02:08:09.360 names. But it was the nameless millions
02:08:12.000 who made Rome possible. And it was they
02:08:14.560 who suffered when it fell. We forget how
02:08:17.599 hard it was to live in Rome. How
02:08:20.360 dangerous, how uncertain. Plague came
02:08:23.280 often. Fires burned quickly. Leaders
02:08:26.320 changed in days. If you were born
02:08:29.159 poor, chances are you stayed poor. If
02:08:32.800 you were born free, you might not die
02:08:35.040 that way. And yet for all its
02:08:37.639 cruelty, people still believed in Rome.
02:08:40.719 They believed in its promise. Even if it
02:08:43.760 wasn't always delivered, they wore their
02:08:46.119 togas. They cheered at games. They
02:08:49.440 buried their dead with little
02:08:51.560 inscriptions. This manibus to the
02:08:54.480 spirits of the departed. A whisper of
02:08:57.040 hope that something somewhere would
02:09:00.079 remember them. Maybe we just did. And
02:09:02.880 what of the emperors? the ones whose
02:09:05.199 names endure.
02:09:07.400 Romulus, who killed his brother to found
02:09:10.079 a city. Augustus, who made that city the
02:09:13.920 center of the world. Nero, who sang
02:09:17.040 while it burned. Hadrien, who built
02:09:19.840 walls. Constantine, who bent the cross
02:09:22.800 and the crown into one. Julian, who
02:09:25.599 tried to pull the gods back into power.
02:09:28.040 Justinian, who dreamed of restoring it
02:09:30.560 all. and Constantine 11 who died on the
02:09:33.520 wall, sword in hand as the empire ended
02:09:36.719 around him. Were they tyrants,
02:09:39.400 visionaries, both? Rome had emperors who
02:09:42.960 murdered their wives, and emperors who
02:09:45.440 built aqueducts so clean water could
02:09:48.320 reach the slums. It had emperors who
02:09:50.560 ruled for a week, and emperors who ruled
02:09:53.040 for decades and left no trace behind.
02:09:56.400 They were not gods. They were people.
02:09:59.280 flawed, afraid, brilliant, arrogant,
02:10:03.440 tired. And somehow they kept it going,
02:10:07.199 kept the lights on, kept the grain
02:10:10.119 flowing, kept the idea alive even when
02:10:13.760 everything else cracked. Because more
02:10:15.760 than anything else, Rome was a balancing
02:10:18.880 act between chaos and control, between
02:10:22.040 glory and grief, between the crowd and
02:10:25.360 the crown. And that
02:10:27.480 balance, once broken, can't be repaired,
02:10:31.360 only remembered. Rome lasted longer than
02:10:33.920 most things we call old. It lived
02:10:36.159 through iron and fire, flood and famine.
02:10:39.360 It was ruled by kings, by consils, by
02:10:42.560 emperors, by generals, by children. It
02:10:45.679 changed languages, religions, laws. It
02:10:49.440 ruled continents. And still, for a
02:10:51.840 while, it stayed Rome. Empires don't
02:10:54.639 usually last that long. Most burn hot
02:10:57.040 and fall fast. But Rome learned how to
02:10:59.760 survive. It learned how to adapt. It
02:11:02.719 borrowed gods from the Greeks, clothes
02:11:04.960 from the Atruscans, military tactics
02:11:07.599 from the Carthaginians, architecture
02:11:10.159 from the Egyptians, and it made them
02:11:12.239 Roman. It didn't invent everything, but
02:11:14.960 it refined, organized, and claimed. It
02:11:18.560 didn't need to be first. It just needed
02:11:20.719 to be final. The key to Rome's survival
02:11:24.079 wasn't just force. It was absorption. A
02:11:27.360 Roman general could conquer your city
02:11:29.280 one day and offer you citizenship the
02:11:31.960 next. Fight us and we destroy you. Join
02:11:36.079 us and you can wear the toga. The roads
02:11:39.360 we build will lead to your town. Your
02:11:42.480 sons can join our legions. Your gods can
02:11:45.360 sit in our
02:11:46.440 temples. And little by little, your
02:11:49.199 world becomes ours. You stop calling it
02:11:52.280 Rome and start calling it home. It was
02:11:55.840 clever. It was cold, but it worked.
02:11:59.119 That's how an empire lasts. And when it
02:12:01.840 couldn't conquer, it compromised. When
02:12:05.280 it couldn't grow, it defended. When it
02:12:08.079 couldn't dominate, it delayed. Rome
02:12:10.400 didn't always win. But it never gave up
02:12:13.040 easily. It learned from failure. After
02:12:15.760 Cana, it raised another army. After
02:12:18.440 disasters, it buried the dead and
02:12:20.960 marched again. There was something
02:12:22.800 relentless about Rome. Something that
02:12:25.119 refused to vanish. Even as cities
02:12:27.440 burned, even as emperors fell. Even as
02:12:30.719 borders collapsed, it still called
02:12:33.040 itself eternal. Maybe that was madness.
02:12:36.239 Maybe that was faith. But either way, it
02:12:39.119 left a mark. And not just on stone, but
02:12:41.840 on thought. Roman ideas still live in
02:12:44.560 courtrooms and classrooms. In how we
02:12:47.119 build cities, in how we argue laws, in
02:12:50.320 how we count days, the calendar you use.
02:12:53.520 Roman, the names of the months. Roman,
02:12:56.960 the concept of citizenship. Roman, the
02:12:59.840 word senate, the dream of a republic,
02:13:03.199 the fear of dictatorship, all of it.
02:13:06.560 Roman, we don't realize it because it's
02:13:09.040 become so normal, so foundational, like
02:13:12.320 water, like breath. And yes, Rome had
02:13:16.159 horrors, slavery, brutality, executions
02:13:20.159 as entertainment, entire peoples erased
02:13:23.119 because they resisted. It is not a
02:13:25.280 legacy to worship blindly, but it is one
02:13:28.079 to study carefully because in the bones
02:13:30.639 of Rome, we see what we are capable of.
02:13:34.320 both the heights and the depths, the
02:13:37.440 power to organize millions, and the
02:13:40.000 power to destroy with efficiency, the
02:13:42.639 ability to write law and to use that law
02:13:45.920 to silence. That's what makes Rome
02:13:48.800 eternal, not its survival, but its
02:13:51.520 lesson. It tells us everything built can
02:13:54.000 be broken. And everything broken was
02:13:57.199 once believed unbreakable. Long after
02:14:00.079 the last emperor fell, people still
02:14:02.719 called themselves Roman in the east. The
02:14:05.920 Byzantines didn't even use the word
02:14:07.760 Byzantine. They were Romans.
02:14:10.679 Romero, subjects of the emperor,
02:14:13.440 guardians of the flame, a merchant in
02:14:16.679 Constantinople, a farmer in the
02:14:18.560 Anatolian hills, a monk on a rocky
02:14:21.440 island, all Roman. Even as their
02:14:24.320 language shifted to Greek, even as their
02:14:27.199 theology split from the west, the name
02:14:30.079 held on. Rome wasn't just a city. It was
02:14:33.360 a civilization you could belong to. Even
02:14:36.400 if you'd never seen the Tyber, it was a
02:14:39.119 badge, a dream, a compass. In the West,
02:14:44.159 the name carried even more weight. To be
02:14:46.560 Roman was to be legitimate. That's why
02:14:49.119 the Pope crowned emperors. That's why
02:14:52.000 kings hired scribes to fake Roman
02:14:54.840 genealogies. That's why men who had
02:14:57.040 never seen a legion, never heard Latin
02:14:59.760 spoken aloud, still claimed Roman blood.
02:15:03.360 Even Charlemagne, born in a Frankish
02:15:05.920 palace far from Italy, ruled with a seal
02:15:09.280 that bore the eagle, just like Augustus.
02:15:12.800 Even Napoleon crowned himself on Roman
02:15:15.440 style thrones. Even today when we call
02:15:18.560 something imperial, when we imagine
02:15:21.199 roads stretching to the horizon or
02:15:24.000 marble columns rising into blue sky, we
02:15:27.360 are thinking in Roman terms. But what
02:15:29.920 did it actually mean to be Roman? It
02:15:32.880 depended on the time. In the early
02:15:34.800 republic, it meant loyalty to the
02:15:37.320 Senate, discipline in battle, sacrifice
02:15:40.639 for the state. In the imperial era, it
02:15:43.760 meant order,
02:15:45.639 citizenship, law. Under Constantine, it
02:15:49.360 meant Christianity. Under Justinian, it
02:15:52.719 meant legacy. And near the end, when
02:15:55.760 borders were gone and emperors ruled
02:15:58.560 from shadowed palaces, it meant clinging
02:16:01.679 to a memory. To be Roman was to believe
02:16:04.719 in something larger than your village,
02:16:07.360 your tribe, even your god. It meant
02:16:10.000 believing in an idea. And ideas are hard
02:16:12.560 to kill. They survive
02:16:15.000 conquest. They survive ruin. They
02:16:17.840 survive being
02:16:19.239 misused, distorted, forgotten. The Roman
02:16:22.800 Empire died in pieces. A slow falling,
02:16:26.960 not a single day, but the Roman
02:16:29.719 identity that endured. It became part of
02:16:33.120 the DNA of the West. Even today when we
02:16:36.398 debate republics or empires, power or
02:16:40.318 liberty, justice or order, we are
02:16:43.679 speaking in a language Rome helped
02:16:46.240 shape. Our debates are their
02:16:48.679 debates. Our fears, their fears when we
02:16:52.478 ask whether one man should hold too much
02:16:54.679 power. We're hearing echoes of the
02:16:57.040 Senate before Caesar crossed the
02:16:59.200 Rubicum. When we worry about borders,
02:17:02.439 citizenship, rights, we are replaying
02:17:05.359 questions they wrote into law over 2,000
02:17:08.398 years ago. Rome is a net just history.
02:17:12.080 It's architecture, philosophy, language,
02:17:16.040 bureaucracy, faith, pride, regret. It's
02:17:20.000 what happens when people believe they
02:17:22.000 can outlast time. And in a way, they do.
02:17:26.160 Every empire believes it is different,
02:17:28.398 that it will last forever, that it has
02:17:30.558 learned from those that fell before it.
02:17:32.718 But Rome reminds us that even the
02:17:35.000 greatest can slip. Not all at once, not
02:17:38.718 with fireworks, but slowly, quietly.
02:17:42.318 Like a tide pulling back from the shore,
02:17:44.879 it didn't fall because of one battle or
02:17:47.679 one emperor or one plague. It fell
02:17:50.478 because time wears things down. Because
02:17:53.200 power breeds fragility. Because
02:17:55.359 complexity becomes too heavy to carry.
02:17:58.318 The roads crack, the borders stretch,
02:18:01.679 the ideals fade. And then one day, a
02:18:05.679 city that once ruled the known world
02:18:07.840 wakes up to find it is simply a city
02:18:11.200 proud, beautiful, but no longer central.
02:18:14.959 And yet there is a kind of peace in that
02:18:18.160 because Rome teaches us something most
02:18:20.478 history doesn't. That everything ends.
02:18:23.760 But endings aren't always failures. That
02:18:27.599 legacy doesn't live in control, but in
02:18:30.519 influence. The Roman Republic ended, but
02:18:34.160 gave us laws and language. The Roman
02:18:36.638 Empire fell, but gave us
02:18:39.318 architecture, calendars, and cathedrals.
02:18:42.318 Even the worst emperors, even the
02:18:44.879 darkest days, they were still chapters.
02:18:48.080 And every chapter, even the painful
02:18:50.638 ones, builds something. You can still
02:18:53.519 see the outlines of Rome in the design
02:18:56.160 of Washington DC or in the floor plans
02:18:59.200 of Paris and London. You can still hear
02:19:01.679 Rome in the words we speak. Even the
02:19:04.638 idea of empire, of one power ruling over
02:19:07.599 many, is impossible to describe without
02:19:10.160 using Rome as the reference point. We
02:19:13.120 call things pre- Roman or post Roman. We
02:19:16.478 define time by its shadow. We say the
02:19:19.359 fall of Rome like it was the fall of the
02:19:22.318 sky. And in some ways it was. But the
02:19:25.920 truth is Rome never had a clean ending.
02:19:30.000 It faded. It
02:19:32.200 shifted. It fractured and reformed. It
02:19:35.359 lives in the books we read, the
02:19:37.200 buildings we enter, the governments we
02:19:39.519 question, the churches we kneel in, the
02:19:42.398 universities we graduate from. Even our
02:19:44.959 stories, our fiction carry its trace.
02:19:48.640 Every empire in a fantasy novel, every
02:19:51.680 Senate in a sci-fi movie, every Caesar
02:19:54.399 in disguise, Rome taught the world how
02:19:57.040 to imagine power and how to fear it.
02:19:59.840 Because Rome was not just a place or a
02:20:02.680 government or even a culture. Rome was a
02:20:06.080 habit, a pattern we return to when we
02:20:08.640 want to organize the world or control
02:20:11.200 it. For most people who lived after the
02:20:13.800 fall, Rome wasn't history. It was
02:20:16.800 legend. A golden age just out of
02:20:19.960 reach. A dream passed down in song and
02:20:22.880 sermon. In half remembered names, in
02:20:25.680 ruins covered by grass and silence.
02:20:28.240 Peasants plowed fields where legions
02:20:30.560 once marched. Monks copied fragments of
02:20:33.280 Latin texts. Not always knowing what
02:20:35.840 they meant. Children played in
02:20:37.680 amphitheaters.
02:20:39.200 Unaware, their footsteps echoed beneath
02:20:41.280 the ghosts of gladiators. The Roman
02:20:43.520 Empire became a memory handed down, like
02:20:46.880 a story too good to let go. And so it
02:20:49.600 lingered. In medieval minds, Rome was a
02:20:52.720 place of order in a world gone chaotic.
02:20:55.520 In the Renaissance, it became a symbol
02:20:58.000 of beauty, of harmony, of human
02:21:00.720 possibility. When they built cathedrals,
02:21:03.520 they copied Roman arches. When they
02:21:05.760 imagined justice, they quoted Cicero.
02:21:08.800 When they studied anatomy, astronomy,
02:21:11.800 philosophy, they were chasing knowledge
02:21:14.319 that had once been stored in scrolls in
02:21:16.720 Roman libraries, now lost to fire. But
02:21:19.600 even in
02:21:20.600 imagination, Rome wasn't just admired.
02:21:23.280 It was feared. Because the fall of Rome
02:21:25.680 became the great cautionary tale.
02:21:27.920 Historians debated it for centuries. Why
02:21:30.880 did it fall? Was it decadence,
02:21:33.280 corruption, invasion, Christianity,
02:21:36.399 climate, the wrong emperors, the wrong
02:21:38.960 gods? Everyone had a theory, and every
02:21:41.520 theory said more about the present than
02:21:43.520 the past. When people feared their own
02:21:45.680 nations would decline, they saw Rome in
02:21:48.240 the mirror. When the British Empire
02:21:50.240 spread across the globe, its leaders
02:21:52.560 invoked Rome as a warning and a guide.
02:21:55.120 When America rose, Rome was both its
02:21:57.920 model and its anxiety. It was the
02:22:00.399 republic to be imitated and the empire
02:22:02.880 to be avoided. The founding fathers
02:22:05.200 named cities after Roman ideals. They
02:22:07.840 debated tyranny with Caesar in the back
02:22:10.000 of their minds. They called their senate
02:22:12.640 a senate. They imagined their enemies as
02:22:15.120 emperors. And still today, the fall of
02:22:18.080 Rome gets referenced in news articles,
02:22:20.880 in classrooms, in books that try to make
02:22:23.760 sense of modern decline. But maybe the
02:22:26.479 wrong question is why Rome fell. Maybe
02:22:30.080 the better one is how it lasted so long.
02:22:32.800 No empire before or since has held so
02:22:35.439 much land, so many people for so many
02:22:38.200 centuries, and kept the illusion of
02:22:40.399 unity for that long. It wasn't luck. It
02:22:44.160 wasn't just violence. It was
02:22:45.880 adaptability. Rome changed with every
02:22:48.439 century. It absorbed ideas from every
02:22:51.240 direction. Africa, Asia, Europe. It
02:22:54.960 absorbed gods, languages, technologies.
02:22:58.800 It rewrote itself constantly. And that's
02:23:01.280 why even now pieces of it still survive.
02:23:04.960 Because Rome was never just a thing. It
02:23:07.680 was a rhythm. And that rhythm still
02:23:10.000 plays. Most of what we remember about
02:23:12.240 Rome comes from the center. The palaces,
02:23:15.760 the speeches, the senators draped in
02:23:18.880 white, the emperors posing on coins. But
02:23:22.479 the truth of Rome, the heartbeat of it,
02:23:25.040 often lived at the edge. Along the Rine,
02:23:27.760 where fog rolled in over pine forests,
02:23:30.960 Roman forts stood watch beside
02:23:32.960 riverbanks thick with mud and stories.
02:23:36.399 Soldiers posted there came from every
02:23:39.120 part of the empire. Syrians, Africans,
02:23:42.640 Gauls, Yrians, all speaking different
02:23:45.680 tongues, eating different food,
02:23:48.000 worshiping different gods, all wearing
02:23:50.319 Roman armor. They carved graffiti into
02:23:52.880 stone walls, complained about the
02:23:54.880 weather, wrote letters home. They fought
02:23:57.520 tribes whose names would one day become
02:24:00.000 the names of kingdoms, Franks, Saxons,
02:24:04.080 Goths. Some of those tribes feared Rome,
02:24:07.040 others traded with it, and some joined
02:24:09.200 it. To the north in Britain, Roman roads
02:24:12.640 still cut across green hills. Farmers
02:24:15.680 still plow fields where Roman coins are
02:24:19.000 found. Worn smooth by centuries
02:24:21.800 underground. Hadrien's wall snakes
02:24:24.240 across the landscape like a sleeping
02:24:27.040 thought dividing what was Roman from
02:24:29.200 what was not. But it was never a perfect
02:24:32.000 line. Beyond the wall, Roman goods have
02:24:35.280 been found. Roman words borrowed. Rome
02:24:39.359 leaked into the world. Sometimes through
02:24:42.600 force, sometimes through trade, and
02:24:45.920 sometimes through love. A Roman merchant
02:24:49.040 might fall for a local girl. A soldier
02:24:51.920 might settle down, raise children who no
02:24:54.880 longer spoke Latin, but still lit
02:24:57.280 candles to Jupiter. The empire moved in
02:25:00.080 both directions. To the east, the desert
02:25:03.600 shimmerred. Roman banners flew beside
02:25:05.840 the Euphrates. Cities like Palmira stood
02:25:09.520 at the crossroads between worlds. In
02:25:12.000 some homes, you could find Roman mosaics
02:25:14.479 on the floor and Persian carpets on the
02:25:17.359 wall. The blend was natural. Rome never
02:25:20.160 truly erased what came before. It
02:25:22.640 layered a Greek god beside a Roman one
02:25:26.240 beside a local spirit, a Latin
02:25:28.640 inscription next to one in Aramaic. In
02:25:31.760 Egypt, the temples of old gods were
02:25:34.240 converted, but their shape remained.
02:25:37.120 Rome didn't demand purity. It demanded
02:25:40.439 loyalty. Pay taxes. Don't rebel. Swear
02:25:44.160 by the eagle, everything else was
02:25:46.359 negotiable. And in Africa, Rome thrived.
02:25:50.479 The province of Africa, what is now
02:25:53.359 Tunisia and parts of Algeria and Libya,
02:25:56.479 was rich in grain, olives, and
02:25:59.439 intellect.
02:26:00.680 Carthage, once Rome's enemy, became one
02:26:03.280 of its jewels. Its amphitheaters rivaled
02:26:06.479 anything in Italy. Its scholars helped
02:26:09.200 shape Christianity, and its fields fed
02:26:11.600 the empire for centuries. Roman Africa
02:26:14.479 wasn't a dusty edge. It was a beating
02:26:17.439 heart until it wasn't, until it faded
02:26:20.240 beneath invasions and forgetfulness,
02:26:22.560 beneath sand and sea and time. But it
02:26:25.600 was there, part of Rome, fully, quietly,
02:26:29.720 gloriously. Because at its edges, Rome
02:26:33.120 was something different. Not eternal,
02:26:35.920 but human. To most
02:26:37.960 people, Rome wasn't battles and
02:26:41.080 politics. It was
02:26:43.160 breakfast. It was work. It was surviving
02:26:46.080 the summer heat, finding water when the
02:26:49.120 aqueduct ran dry, getting through the
02:26:51.600 day. A Roman day began with light. Not
02:26:54.640 alarm clocks or emails. Just the sun
02:26:57.680 sliding across rooftops. People rose
02:27:00.640 early. Fires were lit in courtyards.
02:27:03.840 Bread baked. Traders open their stalls
02:27:06.800 in a tenement in Sabura. A crowded
02:27:09.680 neighborhood of Rome. The smell of
02:27:11.600 garlic and ash clung to the air. 10,
02:27:15.040 maybe 15 people shared a single floor.
02:27:18.000 Some were born there. Others arrived
02:27:20.479 yesterday.
02:27:21.920 All of them Roman. The rich had
02:27:24.760 villas. The poor had hope. Children
02:27:28.000 played in alleys, tossing nuts, chasing
02:27:31.600 dogs, mimicking chariot races they'd
02:27:34.080 never see. Teachers walked the streets
02:27:36.080 with wooden rods, shouting for students
02:27:38.880 to recite their Latin declenions. In the
02:27:41.800 bathous, everyone was equal. naked,
02:27:45.640 sweating, arguing about theater,
02:27:48.520 politics, gladiators, bathing was
02:27:51.560 ritual. It was gossip. It was escape. In
02:27:55.600 the forum, lawyers shouted and merchants
02:27:58.920 haggled. Above them, statues watched.
02:28:02.640 Emperors carved in stone, staring into
02:28:05.240 forever. By noon, the sun was harsh.
02:28:08.960 Shade became currency. The city buzzed
02:28:11.359 and quieted and buzzed again. Lunch was
02:28:14.520 simple. Bread dipped in oil. Figs if you
02:28:17.760 were lucky. Maybe cheese. Maybe nothing.
02:28:21.120 For most, life wasn't luxurious. It was
02:28:24.439 repetition. Laborers worked until they
02:28:26.880 couldn't. Slaves moved silently.
02:28:29.439 Housewives lit lamps in kitchens made of
02:28:31.840 clay and soot. The empire promised
02:28:34.240 peace, but peace didn't mean comfort. It
02:28:37.520 meant no one was invading. It didn't
02:28:39.680 mean you'd eat tomorrow or survive
02:28:41.880 childbirth or keep your stall on the
02:28:44.479 corner. But there was joy too, in
02:28:47.640 festivals, in theater, in laughter
02:28:50.880 around wine poured too freely. Romans
02:28:54.280 danced, sang, made jokes about their
02:28:57.800 leaders, prayed to gods they didn't
02:29:00.080 fear, just hoped would listen. They
02:29:02.800 celebrated Satinalia by turning the
02:29:05.600 world upside down. Masters serve slaves.
02:29:09.359 Gifts were exchanged. Rules forgotten.
02:29:12.640 The city would glow in candlelight and
02:29:15.640 drunkenness. And when the day ended,
02:29:18.479 people returned to their rooms, their
02:29:21.160 gardens, their rented floors. They
02:29:23.920 whispered prayers to household spirits.
02:29:26.399 They slept with doors bolted. They
02:29:29.359 dreamed not of empire, but of tomorrow,
02:29:32.720 of rain, of grain prices, of a child's
02:29:36.399 cough disappearing by morning. Because
02:29:39.120 empire is made, not of marble, but of
02:29:42.399 people trying to get by. Rome's gods
02:29:44.800 were everywhere, on
02:29:46.920 coins, in doorways carved into public
02:29:51.080 fountains, and painted across bedroom
02:29:53.600 walls. They weren't distant or
02:29:56.319 unknowable. They were companions,
02:30:00.439 patrons, watchers. You didn't have to
02:30:03.520 love them, just respect them. You made
02:30:06.240 offerings not out of adoration, but
02:30:08.479 because it was tradition, it was
02:30:10.680 structure. Before a trip, before a
02:30:13.520 business deal, before planting a field,
02:30:16.319 you lit a candle or poured wine or left
02:30:19.120 a pinch of grain. It wasn't mystical. It
02:30:22.080 was habit. Part of the rhythm of being
02:30:24.960 Roman. Jupiter ruled the sky. Juno
02:30:28.960 watched over marriage. Mars walked with
02:30:32.120 soldiers. Vesta guarded the hearth. And
02:30:35.040 in every home there were the lars.
02:30:37.680 Little household spirits who protected
02:30:39.840 the family. Their tiny shrines stood in
02:30:42.439 kitchens. Beside clay cups and burnt
02:30:45.359 offerings. People spoke to them
02:30:47.280 casually, like a grandfather you
02:30:49.280 couldn't see, but trusted to keep watch.
02:30:52.960 The gods weren't perfect.
02:30:55.359 They were emotional, petty, prone to
02:30:58.000 jealousy. But they were present. You
02:31:00.880 could feel them in the thunder, the
02:31:03.160 harvest, the luck of a good day. Temples
02:31:06.479 rose like stone prayers. In Rome, they
02:31:09.840 were everywhere. The Pantheon with its
02:31:12.880 great dome open to the sky, letting in
02:31:15.760 sun and rain and wonder. Priests tended
02:31:18.319 rituals with careful hands. Festivals
02:31:21.680 filled the calendar. Some were solemn,
02:31:24.399 others chaotic. Crowds gathered, animals
02:31:28.080 were
02:31:28.920 sacrificed. Oracles muttered, drums
02:31:32.359 pounded. Faith was performance, public
02:31:36.960 and alive. And then it changed. Slowly,
02:31:41.520 quietly, then suddenly, the old gods
02:31:44.800 began to fade. At first, no one noticed.
02:31:49.120 Christians were a small sect, strange,
02:31:52.120 stubborn, refusing to bow to Caesar or
02:31:55.520 sacrifice to Jupiter. They met in
02:31:57.920 private homes, buried their dead with
02:32:00.720 quiet hope, then martyed. But they
02:32:03.680 endured the more Rome tried to crush
02:32:06.000 them, the more they spread until at last
02:32:09.600 one of Rome's own emperors, Constantine,
02:32:12.560 embraced their cross. Christianity went
02:32:15.640 from underground faith to imperial
02:32:19.120 banner. Churches replaced temples.
02:32:22.240 Bishops replaced orars. Processions
02:32:24.640 carried saints instead of sacred
02:32:26.479 chickens. The empire became Christian
02:32:29.200 and so did the people. Slowly with
02:32:31.840 tension, some mourned the old gods. Some
02:32:35.200 mixed the two. A statue of Venus beside
02:32:38.080 a cross. A festival renamed but not
02:32:41.439 forgotten. But for many, the essence of
02:32:45.359 belief stayed the same. Pray for health.
02:32:49.120 Pray for the harvest. Pray that the
02:32:51.439 empire holds another year. Whether to
02:32:53.840 Jupiter or Jesus, the fear was the same.
02:32:57.680 The hope was the same. Because faith in
02:33:01.120 Rome was never just about gods. It was
02:33:04.399 about
02:33:05.319 continuity, something older than
02:33:07.479 emperors, something to whisper to. when
02:33:10.880 the lamps were low. If Rome had a heart
02:33:13.439 that beat for more than conquest or law,
02:33:16.479 it beat for spectacle. The Romans didn't
02:33:19.280 just rule, they performed. And nowhere
02:33:22.240 was that clearer than in the coliseum.
02:33:24.479 The Flavian amphitheater, as it was
02:33:26.880 originally known, could hold more than
02:33:29.120 50,000 people. Teared seating wrapped
02:33:32.640 around a sandcovered floor stained red
02:33:35.520 by history. On festival days, it filled
02:33:38.880 before sunrise. Senators in marble
02:33:41.920 seats, merchants higher up, the poor
02:33:45.120 squeezed into the top rows under canvas
02:33:47.359 awnings. All united by the promise of
02:33:50.680 distraction. Gladiators waited beneath
02:33:53.359 the arena. Some slaves, some volunteers,
02:33:56.479 some legends. They oiled their arms,
02:33:59.680 tied leather straps, kissed tokens from
02:34:03.040 wives or gods, and the doors opened. and
02:34:06.560 the roar swallowed them. Fights weren't
02:34:08.880 always to the death. Sometimes it was
02:34:11.680 skill, theater, pauses for mercy. But
02:34:14.800 when the crowd demanded blood, few dared
02:34:17.760 to disappoint them. Emperors watched
02:34:19.920 too. Some participated, Comeodus
02:34:22.880 famously entered the arena himself.
02:34:25.680 Dressed as Hercules, striking down
02:34:28.240 beasts with golden arrows. It wasn't
02:34:30.800 about danger. It was about dominance.
02:34:33.760 Rome didn't just survive. It
02:34:36.439 entertained. And it wasn't only blood.
02:34:39.120 There were mock naval battles. The
02:34:41.760 coliseum flooded with water. Enactments
02:34:44.800 of great victories, exotic animals.
02:34:48.479 Lions, crocodiles, giraffes brought from
02:34:51.439 across the empire. A peacock might draw
02:34:54.479 more than a sword. The people came not
02:34:57.120 to learn, but to forget. to forget grain
02:34:59.960 shortages, rising rents, dull jobs,
02:35:04.000 their own mortality. The Circus Maximus,
02:35:08.120 meanwhile, offered speed. Chariots
02:35:11.040 thundered in loops, dust curling into
02:35:13.920 the air as crowds screamed for red,
02:35:16.960 green, blue, or white. The four main
02:35:20.080 racing
02:35:21.240 factions. People gambled, prayed, swore
02:35:24.960 loyalty to teams like Modern Fans. Riots
02:35:28.240 broke out over races. Alliances formed
02:35:31.359 around them. Even emperors picked
02:35:33.800 favorites. It wasn't just sport. It was
02:35:37.640 identity. Belonging. Emotion shared
02:35:40.479 across a 100,000 voices at once. For the
02:35:45.319 Romans, entertainment wasn't a luxury.
02:35:48.560 It was a right. Bread and
02:35:51.160 circuses. The poet said, "Feed the
02:35:54.120 people and give them something to watch.
02:35:57.359 and they will follow. It was cynical,
02:35:59.840 but it wasn't wrong. In a world where
02:36:02.000 life was short, war was constant, and
02:36:04.720 change was inevitable. These moments of
02:36:07.600 escape mattered. And behind the noise
02:36:11.080 always, was control. The coliseum was
02:36:15.040 built beside the ruins of Nero's palace,
02:36:18.319 a reminder the emperors fall, but empire
02:36:21.319 continues. That power can be replaced by
02:36:24.160 stone. that the people can cheer for
02:36:26.240 your downfall one day and the next cheer
02:36:29.840 for someone else because crowds forget.
02:36:33.600 But Rome never did. Before Rome was
02:36:36.120 marble, it was stone. Before it ruled
02:36:39.040 the world, it built roads. Not
02:36:42.600 glamorous, not glorious, but essential.
02:36:46.080 The Roman road system stretched over
02:36:49.319 250,000 m, enough to circle the earth 10
02:36:53.280 times. They were built by soldiers layer
02:36:56.399 by layer, dirt, gravel, stone, wall
02:37:00.160 bound by sweat and precision. They cut
02:37:02.560 straight through hills, bridged over
02:37:04.640 rivers, ignored the curve of the land
02:37:07.359 because Rome believed in lines, in
02:37:09.680 clarity, impermanence. And along those
02:37:12.720 roads moved everything, legions,
02:37:16.040 merchants, messengers, emperors. They
02:37:19.600 connected fortresses to ports, towns to
02:37:22.640 temples, capitals to the edge of the
02:37:24.960 known world. There's a reason we still
02:37:27.359 say all roads lead to Rome. Because once
02:37:30.640 they did. But Rome didn't just conquer
02:37:33.359 with weapons. It conquered with water.
02:37:36.160 The aqueducts were miracles in stone.
02:37:39.520 Carrying clean water across valleys,
02:37:42.080 under hills, into cities teeming with
02:37:44.880 people. The aqua claudia. The aqua aria
02:37:49.120 arches marching across the land like
02:37:51.680 frozen processions. Some aqueducts
02:37:54.880 stretched for over 50 m powered only by
02:37:57.840 gravity. Designed so precisely that
02:38:00.720 water flowed in silence. They fed
02:38:03.399 fountains, bathous, private homes. Even
02:38:07.359 the poorest Roman might fill a jug from
02:38:09.680 a spout carved with lion heads and
02:38:11.760 marble gods. Sewers, too, were part of
02:38:15.200 the empire's quiet genius. The cloak of
02:38:18.000 Maxima, the great drain, carried waste
02:38:21.040 out of the city, beneath temples and
02:38:23.520 markets and senators feet. Rome believed
02:38:26.240 in motion, not just of armies and trade,
02:38:29.200 but of water, waste, heat, light. The
02:38:33.359 city pulsed like an organism, alive with
02:38:36.240 systems most never saw, but all relied
02:38:38.640 on. Bridges cross rivers once feared.
02:38:41.600 Harbors were dug from reluctant coasts.
02:38:44.800 Dams tamed floods, heating systems,
02:38:48.439 hypercosts, pushed warm air beneath
02:38:50.760 floors, letting rich Romans bathe in
02:38:53.600 comfort as snow fell outside. Engineers
02:38:56.399 were as prized as poets. A well-built
02:38:59.680 arch could outlast an emperor, and many
02:39:02.319 did. These weren't isolated marvels.
02:39:05.600 They were part of a vision. A Roman
02:39:08.000 could travel from Londinium to Antioch.
02:39:11.359 and know what mile marker they'd pass
02:39:13.520 next, what coin they'd use, what law
02:39:16.800 would protect them. Standardization
02:39:19.439 wasn't just efficiency. It was control.
02:39:22.880 It was civilization extended across time
02:39:25.920 zones and
02:39:27.000 languages. It made everything feel
02:39:29.680 Roman. And centuries later, when the
02:39:33.280 empire fell, the roads remained, the
02:39:37.319 aqueducts still stood. The stones
02:39:40.160 outlasted the men who carved them, and
02:39:42.640 travelers would walk those same paths,
02:39:45.439 brush their fingers along ancient walls,
02:39:48.080 and wonder who had come before. Rome
02:39:50.800 built not just for itself, but for the
02:39:53.600 future. Rome didn't invent philosophy.
02:39:56.240 That was Greece's gift. But Rome carried
02:39:58.640 it forward, sharpened it, softened it,
02:40:01.600 translated it into a world of soldiers,
02:40:04.680 merchants, senators, and slaves. Roman
02:40:07.920 thinkers weren't just dreamers. They
02:40:10.479 were survivors. Their questions weren't
02:40:13.120 about the stars. They were about how to
02:40:15.600 live, how to endure pain, how to remain
02:40:18.640 calm in chaos, how to be good in a world
02:40:22.240 that rarely rewarded it. Stoicism, born
02:40:25.200 in Greece, became the soul of Roman
02:40:27.600 thought. It lived in Epictitus, a former
02:40:30.399 slave who taught that we must control
02:40:33.200 only what we can, our actions, our
02:40:36.080 responses, our minds. It lived in
02:40:38.560 Senica, adviser to Nero, who preached
02:40:41.720 self-control, even as the empire
02:40:43.760 crumbled around him. And it lived most
02:40:45.920 powerfully in Marcus Aurelius, the
02:40:48.479 philosopher emperor, who wrote
02:40:50.439 meditations not for fame, but for
02:40:52.960 clarity. notes to himself. Words
02:40:55.439 scratched on the edge of battlefields.
02:40:57.680 You have power over your mind, he wrote.
02:41:00.399 Not outside events, but Roman knowledge
02:41:04.000 stretched beyond ethics. In medicine,
02:41:07.520 Galen dissected pigs and monkeys,
02:41:10.640 seeking to understand anatomy,
02:41:13.240 circulation, the brain. He was wrong
02:41:15.760 about many things, but his books were
02:41:18.399 gospel for
02:41:19.800 1,500 years. In law, jurists like Ulpion
02:41:24.640 and gas wrote commentaries that still
02:41:27.760 echo in today's legal systems, the right
02:41:30.800 to a trial, the structure of contracts,
02:41:34.080 the protection of property. In
02:41:36.520 architecture, Vituvius wrote about
02:41:39.040 symmetry and proportion. His work
02:41:41.479 inspired Leonardo da Vinci centuries
02:41:44.399 later. In history, Tacitus told dark
02:41:48.640 truths. Libby painted noble myths.
02:41:52.240 Satonius whispered gossip into eternity.
02:41:55.680 And then there was Cicero, statesman,
02:41:59.200 orator, philosopher. His speeches could
02:42:02.160 sway a crowd or doom an enemy. His
02:42:04.800 letters give us glimpses into everyday
02:42:06.880 Roman life. The boredom, the ambition,
02:42:10.640 the friendships fraying under politics.
02:42:13.280 He believed in the republic, in reason,
02:42:16.160 in a world governed by laws, not men.
02:42:19.280 And when Caesar took power,
02:42:21.200 Cicero's voice became resistance.
02:42:23.680 Too loud, too sharp. He was eventually
02:42:26.720 hunted down, killed. His hands and head
02:42:30.560 nailed to the speaker's platform, the
02:42:32.960 very place where he once stood. But the
02:42:35.600 words lived on even when Rome burned.
02:42:39.200 Its libraries smoldered with memory.
02:42:41.840 Scrolls hidden in monasteries. Ideas
02:42:44.640 preserved by Arab scholars in Baghdad
02:42:48.319 passed to Florence. Then to Paris, then
02:42:51.520 to London, then to the world. Rome
02:42:54.640 didn't survive because it conquered. It
02:42:57.680 survived because it taught. And those
02:42:59.920 lessons still speak. Rome didn't just
02:43:02.319 conquer space. It conquered time. The
02:43:05.280 calendar you use right now, this week,
02:43:08.640 this month was born in the empire. The
02:43:11.680 7-day week, the 12 months, the leap
02:43:15.120 year, the names you say without
02:43:17.120 thinking. January, March, July, August,
02:43:21.359 they come from gods and emperors.
02:43:23.439 Janice, the two-faced deity of
02:43:26.479 beginnings. Mars, the god of war. Julius
02:43:30.000 Caesar who reformed the calendar in 46
02:43:33.600 B.CE. Augustus who added his name beside
02:43:37.200 his great uncles. Before Caesar's
02:43:39.439 reforms, the Roman calendar was chaos.
02:43:42.960 Lunar months misaligned with harvests,
02:43:46.240 days added or subtracted by priests
02:43:49.760 playing politics. Caesar, ever the
02:43:52.359 organizer, consulted astronomers and
02:43:55.279 straightened the whole system. It became
02:43:57.439 the Julian calendar. Centuries later, it
02:44:00.479 would be tweaked into the Gregorian
02:44:02.560 calendar we follow today. But the bones
02:44:04.880 are still Roman. And Rome didn't just
02:44:07.279 mark time. It remembered it. It built
02:44:10.080 monuments not to show off. Though they
02:44:12.560 certainly did that, but to remind Arches
02:44:15.439 recorded
02:44:16.520 victories. Columns told stories in stone
02:44:19.520 spirals. Inscriptions listed names,
02:44:22.720 dates, achievements. Even the coins in
02:44:25.920 your pocket carried messages of power,
02:44:29.120 of peace, of past glories. A Roman coin
02:44:33.040 was part money, part billboard. It told
02:44:36.000 you who ruled, what battle was won, what
02:44:39.200 year you were living in. They recorded
02:44:41.359 time like it mattered. Because to the
02:44:44.279 Romans, memory was survival. Every
02:44:47.200 family kept ancestral
02:44:49.240 masks. Imagines wax likenesses of the
02:44:52.720 dead. On special occasions they were
02:44:54.880 brought out, displayed, paraded, not as
02:44:58.399 ghosts to fear, but as reminders of
02:45:02.040 duty. You were never just yourself. You
02:45:04.960 carried the weight of those who came
02:45:06.800 before you and the hope of those who had
02:45:09.120 come after. Even tombstones spoke this
02:45:11.680 language, carved with names, ranks,
02:45:15.359 stories. A freed woman who ran a bakery.
02:45:18.479 A soldier who served 20 years on the
02:45:20.720 rine. A child who died before their
02:45:23.200 first winter. Time marked in marble. The
02:45:26.880 empire taught its people to look back.
02:45:29.520 Even as it expanded forward. Romulus and
02:45:32.720 Remis, the seven kings, the founding of
02:45:35.840 the republic, the rise of Augustus.
02:45:39.040 Everything had a date, a place, a name.
02:45:43.439 Even the years were numbered to bear.
02:45:46.120 Burbandita from the founding of the
02:45:48.160 city. Not from the birth of a god or the
02:45:51.040 reign of a king. But from the myth of
02:45:53.359 Rome itself, the city was the center.
02:45:56.560 Time orbited it. And now that same
02:45:59.600 calendar rules your phone, your
02:46:01.880 holidays, your sense of when and where
02:46:04.160 you are. You count time like a Roman.
02:46:07.040 Even if you have never thought about it,
02:46:10.160 what made someone Roman? Was it where
02:46:12.319 they were born? What language they
02:46:14.240 spoke? What gods they worshiped? In the
02:46:16.960 early days of the
02:46:18.439 republic, it was simple. You were Roman
02:46:22.240 if you came from the city of Rome. But
02:46:24.399 as the empire grew, the definition
02:46:26.960 stretched in the provinces. People began
02:46:30.080 to take Roman names, wear Roman clothes,
02:46:33.120 speak Latin alongside their native
02:46:35.040 tongue. They built forums beside temples
02:46:37.680 to local gods. They made offerings to
02:46:40.000 the emperor and to the old spirits of
02:46:42.640 their land. Roman identity was flexible,
02:46:45.520 strategic. It absorbed rather than
02:46:48.000 erased. And in doing so, it became
02:46:50.640 something new, a shared language of
02:46:53.279 power, law, and belonging.
02:46:56.840 Citizenship, once reserved for an elite
02:46:59.560 few, gradually expanded. You could earn
02:47:02.640 it through military
02:47:04.120 service, through loyalty, through buying
02:47:07.160 it, through surviving long enough for
02:47:09.680 the emperor to grant it to your people.
02:47:11.600 In 212 CE, Emperor Caracala made it
02:47:15.960 official, granting citizenship to nearly
02:47:18.720 every free man in the empire. It wasn't
02:47:21.160 kindness, it was
02:47:23.160 politics. More citizens meant more
02:47:25.640 taxes, more soldiers, more control, but
02:47:29.760 it also meant the Roman world wasn't
02:47:31.840 limited to Rome. A trader in Alexandria,
02:47:35.680 a farmer in Gaul, a sailor in Espania, a
02:47:39.520 blacksmith in Yria. All Roman, all under
02:47:43.439 one law, one coin, one myth. And for
02:47:47.120 many, it
02:47:48.600 mattered. Being Roman meant protection,
02:47:53.080 prestige, a passport to move through a
02:47:55.840 world of walls and gates and
02:47:57.600 checkpoints. A Roman citizen could
02:48:00.080 appeal to higher courts, could marry
02:48:02.720 under Roman law, could speak Latin, and
02:48:05.760 be understood in places they'd never
02:48:07.600 seen. Rome became less a nationality and
02:48:10.399 more a network, a web of shared
02:48:13.240 expectation, contract, and culture. But
02:48:16.240 not everyone wanted to be Roman. Some
02:48:18.960 resisted, fought, clung to older ways.
02:48:22.640 The Druids in Britain, the Zillots in
02:48:25.359 Judea, the Berber tribes in North
02:48:27.680 Africa. Some were crushed, others
02:48:30.319 negotiated
02:48:31.720 space. Rome made room for difference
02:48:35.120 until difference threatened control.
02:48:37.520 Rebellions were met with fire. Cities
02:48:40.680 erased. Survivors sold. But over time,
02:48:44.479 even these places changed. A century
02:48:47.399 later, the grandsons of rebels might
02:48:51.040 wear to gaze, serve in legions, toast
02:48:54.479 the emperor's health in wine poured from
02:48:57.359 Roman clay. Because identity is fluid,
02:49:00.640 and Rome understood that better than
02:49:02.840 most. It wasn't st about erasing the
02:49:05.960 past. It was about folding it into
02:49:08.560 something larger. In the histories of
02:49:10.640 Rome, women are often quiet, tucked into
02:49:13.800 margins, named only when they married
02:49:16.240 power or died violently. But they were
02:49:19.120 there always in every alley, palace,
02:49:23.040 villa, and tenement. They were the
02:49:25.439 heartbeat of the empire, constant,
02:49:28.399 unseen, shaping things from the inside.
02:49:31.279 Roman law placed them under male
02:49:33.439 authority. First their father, then
02:49:36.000 their husband. If both died,
02:49:38.160 guardianship passed to a male relative.
02:49:40.960 They couldn't vote, couldn't hold
02:49:43.160 office. But within their homes, many
02:49:46.000 ruled without title, managed businesses,
02:49:49.279 negotiated deals, raised citizens,
02:49:52.240 trained daughters, smoothed or sharpened
02:49:54.800 the edges of empire. In the early
02:49:57.319 republic, Roman women were expected to
02:50:00.080 be quiet, modest, dutiful. Their role
02:50:03.359 was to bear sons, keep the house, honor
02:50:06.479 the gods, but even then some pushed
02:50:09.600 against the boundaries. Cornelia, mother
02:50:12.160 of the Grucki brothers, was revered not
02:50:15.120 just for her virtue, but for her mind.
02:50:17.680 She hosted salons, spoke with authority,
02:50:21.120 called her sons her jewels, not in
02:50:24.000 flattery, but in ambition. As Rome grew,
02:50:27.760 so did opportunity. Wealthy women owned
02:50:31.040 property, ran farms, funded temples.
02:50:34.800 Some even built their own tombs, carved
02:50:37.680 their lives into stone so they wouldn't
02:50:39.680 be forgotten. Lowerass women sold goods
02:50:42.560 in markets, baked bread for entire
02:50:45.960 neighborhoods, served as midwives,
02:50:48.479 healers, teachers. Enslaved women bore
02:50:51.520 the weight of the city, laboring in
02:50:54.000 kitchens, fields, and bedrooms. Their
02:50:56.399 names are lost, but their fingerprints
02:50:58.880 are everywhere. And in the imperial
02:51:01.319 court, women held power behind veils.
02:51:05.120 Livia, wife of Augustus, was more than a
02:51:08.800 consort, she advised,
02:51:11.720 whispered. Chose, her portraits were
02:51:14.479 modeled after goddesses. Her image
02:51:17.120 carefully curated to represent Roman
02:51:19.640 virtue, serene, strong, silent. But
02:51:23.600 silence can be strategy. An influence
02:51:26.399 doesn't always need a title. A Grapina,
02:51:29.359 mother of Nero, went further. She
02:51:31.840 arranged marriages, orchestrated
02:51:34.200 murders, ruled through her son until he
02:51:37.120 turned on her. She died as many powerful
02:51:39.760 Roman women did by decree, but not
02:51:42.720 before shaping a generation. Priestesses
02:51:45.840 of Vesta, the Vestal virgins held a rare
02:51:49.760 position of reverence. Chosen young,
02:51:52.319 they served for 30 years. Keeping Rome's
02:51:55.840 sacred flame burning. Their word could
02:51:58.319 pardon a condemned man. But breaking
02:52:01.040 their vow of chastity meant death,
02:52:03.920 buried alive, not for sin, but for
02:52:06.920 instability. If the flame went out, so
02:52:09.760 did Rome's luck. Even in
02:52:12.279 Christianity, Roman women shaped the
02:52:15.040 early church. Wealthy widows hosted
02:52:19.160 congregations, wrote letters hid
02:52:22.359 fugitives. Some became saints, others
02:52:26.520 martyrs, or risked their lives for a new
02:52:29.359 kind of truth. They rarely led armies,
02:52:32.720 but they endured everything else. A
02:52:34.800 Roman child didn't choose Rome. They
02:52:37.359 were born into it, into its rhythms, its
02:52:40.319 rules, its dreams. In the early days of
02:52:42.960 life, survival itself was uncertain.
02:52:46.160 Nearly a third of Roman children didn't
02:52:48.399 live past their fifth birthday. Illness,
02:52:51.760 hunger, poor water, accidents. Even in
02:52:55.120 wealthier homes, death waited just
02:52:57.520 beyond the threshold. Parents mourned,
02:53:00.160 but quietly. Grief was expected, not
02:53:03.200 indulged. Small tombstones with carved
02:53:05.920 names. Ages counted in months. Some just
02:53:09.359 read carimma dearest. But if you lived,
02:53:14.240 childhood had structure. The day you
02:53:16.720 were named, usually on the eighth or
02:53:18.880 ninth day after birth, was your true
02:53:21.680 welcome into the world. A ceremony was
02:53:24.160 held. Offerings made. You were given a
02:53:26.720 buller, a small charm worn around the
02:53:29.359 neck to protect you from evil. Boys
02:53:32.080 would wear theirs until
02:53:34.279 manhood. Girls until marriage. For
02:53:38.160 girls, childhood was short. Many married
02:53:41.760 by 12 or 13, sometimes older, sometimes
02:53:44.960 younger. They learned domestic tasks
02:53:47.399 early. Spinning wool, preparing food,
02:53:50.880 tending shrines. Daughters of the elite
02:53:54.000 learned poetry, letters, sometimes
02:53:56.880 Greek, but most were taught to be
02:53:58.880 invisible, obedient, silent. A Roman
02:54:02.720 daughter's honor was the families. Boys,
02:54:06.560 especially those of status, were
02:54:09.200 expected to carry Rome forward. Their
02:54:11.840 education began at home. A tutor, often
02:54:15.520 a Greek slave, would teach them to read
02:54:17.600 and write, to recite speeches, to
02:54:20.240 analyze history. Memorization was
02:54:22.920 prized. Discipline demanded. Mistakes
02:54:26.479 met the rod. They learned not just
02:54:29.200 facts, but presence. how to speak in
02:54:32.520 public, how to command a room because
02:54:35.520 one day they might lead. And Rome
02:54:38.479 required leaders. Games were constant.
02:54:41.840 Children rolled hoops, played
02:54:44.680 knucklebones, flew kites, raced through
02:54:47.880 streets, wooden swords clashed, mock
02:54:51.279 battles rehearsed on dusty rooftops. The
02:54:54.240 rich had dolls with jointed limbs. The
02:54:57.120 poor toys carved from scraps.
02:55:00.880 Laughter filled
02:55:02.439 courtyards. So did chores. Boys became
02:55:05.840 men with the toga verilis. The toga of
02:55:09.560 manhood. Usually around age 15 or 16. A
02:55:13.840 public ceremony marked the shift. The
02:55:16.880 boy set aside his child's buller. Put on
02:55:19.680 the plain white toga and walked into the
02:55:22.800 forum as a citizen. He could now vote be
02:55:26.479 tried in court. He belonged to Rome now.
02:55:30.240 Not just in name, but in duty. For most
02:55:33.439 children, though, there was no grand
02:55:36.000 ceremony, just
02:55:37.800 work. Then more work and maybe a little
02:55:41.760 sleep. Slaves began labor early. Farm
02:55:44.800 children learned to sew and reap before
02:55:46.880 they could read. Life moved fast.
02:55:50.000 Childhood for many, was not a protected
02:55:52.800 space. It was a hallway, short, narrow,
02:55:57.120 full of echoes between birth and
02:55:59.800 responsibility. But still they
02:56:02.760 played. They dreamed. They whispered to
02:56:06.080 the stars, wondering what waited beyond
02:56:08.560 the next sunrise. And in that they were
02:56:11.359 no different than children anywhere
02:56:13.840 else. When night fell in Rome, it did
02:56:16.880 not fall quietly. The city did not sleep
02:56:19.359 as we know it. He shifted, changed,
02:56:22.800 transformed from marble to shadow. Fires
02:56:25.520 flickered in brazers. Lanterns swayed on
02:56:28.640 crooked poles. The air smelled of smoke,
02:56:31.760 wine, and tired feet. Sounds softened.
02:56:36.000 The clatter of sandals, the mutter of
02:56:38.760 neighbors, the scrape of shutters being
02:56:41.439 drawn. Rome at night was no less alive,
02:56:45.200 just slower, more honest. In darkness,
02:56:48.319 the masks slip. The poor stayed close to
02:56:51.680 home. Streets were dangerous, not just
02:56:54.479 from crime, but from uneven stones,
02:56:57.200 wandering animals, sudden violence.
02:56:59.840 There were no police. Not really. Only
02:57:03.200 watchmen, and they were few. Most
02:57:05.560 neighborhoods protected their own. A
02:57:07.840 locked door, a loyal dog, a good
02:57:10.760 neighbor. These were better than laws.
02:57:13.439 Some fires were deliberate, some
02:57:15.520 accidental. Entire blocks might vanish
02:57:18.880 before sunrise, but life continued.
02:57:22.080 Inside tenementss, families gathered
02:57:24.800 around dim light. Meals were simple.
02:57:28.840 Lentils, bread, maybe cheese, maybe
02:57:33.279 wine. Conversations were quiet. A
02:57:36.080 child's day retold. A whispered prayer
02:57:38.880 to the Lis. Lamps burned olive oil, and
02:57:42.319 their glow turned walls gold. Sleep came
02:57:45.520 early, or not at all. In the richer
02:57:48.399 districts, parties lasted deep into the
02:57:51.279 night. Laughter spilled from courtyards.
02:57:54.479 Music echoed behind moaked walls. Slaves
02:57:58.160 carried trays, wiped floors, prepared
02:58:01.439 beds their backs would never rest in.
02:58:03.680 The elite rose late, slept late, drifted
02:58:06.960 through their world like gods in silk.
02:58:09.760 For others, the night was work. Bakers
02:58:13.279 began kneading before the first bird
02:58:15.200 sang. Corers prepared scrolls for early
02:58:18.160 delivery. Soldiers patrolled the gates.
02:58:21.359 Prostitutes waited beneath archways.
02:58:24.319 Thieves stalked rooftops. Owls blinked
02:58:27.279 from ruined columns. The forum so loud
02:58:30.479 by day turned ghostlike. Statues looked
02:58:34.399 older in the dark. The wind moved
02:58:36.560 through columns like memory. And then
02:58:39.840 slowly Rome would hush. Not with
02:58:42.680 silence, but with stillness. A kind of
02:58:45.800 peace, not from safety, but from
02:58:49.040 exhaustion, from repetition, from the
02:58:51.600 steady promise that tomorrow would come.
02:58:54.000 The same streets, the same routines, the
02:58:57.359 same empire creaking but still standing.
02:59:00.880 People curled on straw mats. Some marble
02:59:04.520 couches, on packed earth floors. Some
02:59:07.840 prayed, some wept, some stared into
02:59:11.319 nothing, remembering faces they'd never
02:59:14.000 see again. And across every class, every
02:59:17.520 home, every life, someone whispered,
02:59:21.399 "Romer, eternal Rome." Just words. But
02:59:25.439 what powerful ones to say in the dark?
02:59:28.319 So what was Rome really? After all this,
02:59:31.120 the kings, the republic, the emperors,
02:59:35.120 the borders that moved like breath, what
02:59:38.319 remains? Was it the architecture, the
02:59:41.040 laws, the endless names carved in stone?
02:59:44.319 Maybe. But if you strip away the
02:59:46.200 buildings, the battles, the monuments
02:59:49.120 and myths, what you're left with is a
02:59:52.319 story told and retold, changed in each
02:59:55.760 telling. Sometimes to inspire, sometimes
02:59:58.479 to warn, always to remember. That's what
03:00:00.960 Rome became. Not just a place that once
03:00:03.600 was, but an idea that still is. It was
03:00:06.560 never
03:00:07.399 perfect. Not even close. It enslaved
03:00:11.240 millions, burned
03:00:13.240 villages, silence, descent. It cracked
03:00:16.319 under its own weight more than once. But
03:00:19.040 it also built roads that still guide
03:00:21.120 feet, shaped languages that still form
03:00:24.479 thought, gave structure to dreams that
03:00:26.800 would one day call themselves countries.
03:00:29.840 Even now, thousands of years later, we
03:00:33.359 still build governments that echo the
03:00:35.200 Senate, still debate law with Latin
03:00:37.920 roots, still tell stories with emperors
03:00:40.560 at the center, whether in books, in
03:00:43.200 films, in the quiet corners of our
03:00:45.720 imagination. Rome became a mirror. Every
03:00:48.640 age since has looked into it, searching
03:00:51.680 for reflections of greatness, of
03:00:54.840 warning, of possibility. We admire it.
03:00:58.640 We criticize it. We try to explain it,
03:01:01.439 but we never forget it. And that is its
03:01:04.160 strangest victory. That after the
03:01:06.399 columns crumbled, after the libraries
03:01:09.319 burned, after the temples fell quiet,
03:01:12.080 the memory survived. Not by force, not
03:01:16.080 by decree, but because people kept
03:01:18.319 whispering it to each other. Father to
03:01:21.040 son, teacher to student, page to eye,
03:01:25.120 century after century, that is what Rome
03:01:28.160 left behind. Not just aqueducts and
03:01:30.960 roads, but the instinct to remember
03:01:33.920 because we all want to be part of
03:01:37.240 something lasting, something larger,
03:01:41.120 something that echoes after we're gone.
03:01:44.000 Rome understood that it wrapped itself
03:01:46.800 in eternity. Not because it was eternal,
03:01:50.399 but because it wanted to be, because it
03:01:52.960 needed to be. And maybe in some quiet
03:01:56.359 way it was. Because here we are still
03:02:00.399 talking about it. And now at the end of
03:02:03.279 this long road, we return to where we
03:02:05.640 began. To a city beside a river, watched
03:02:09.439 over by seven hills, born in legend,
03:02:12.880 carved in stone, whispered into history.
03:02:16.399 Rome, not as it was, but as it became, a
03:02:20.359 story, a memory, a shadow cast across
03:02:24.600 centuries. The shewolf nursing twins.
03:02:28.080 The Senate arguing beneath painted
03:02:30.760 ceilings. Legionaries stamping through
03:02:33.279 mud and glory. Emperors pacing marble
03:02:36.640 floors in golden sandals. Children
03:02:39.279 chasing hoops across tiled
03:02:41.800 courtyards. Fires burning, bells
03:02:44.479 ringing, bread baking, statues rising,
03:02:48.319 statues falling. The empire is gone but
03:02:51.840 not forgotten. It lives in
03:02:55.000 fragments, in the arches of train
03:02:57.399 stations, in the columns of capital
03:03:00.040 buildings, in the language of contracts,
03:03:03.200 in the silence of ruined theaters, where
03:03:06.240 tourists walk where citizens once sat.
03:03:09.600 And for a moment, just a breath, the
03:03:12.800 dust stirs like it remembers. Somewhere
03:03:16.240 beneath your feet, right now, there's a
03:03:19.439 stone that once lined a Roman road.
03:03:21.920 Somewhere beneath a vineyard lie the
03:03:24.880 bones of a soldier whose name no one
03:03:27.160 speaks, but whose armor still gleams in
03:03:30.160 the earth's dreams. And maybe, just
03:03:33.319 maybe, Rome still breathes in you every
03:03:36.720 time you tell a story to outlast the
03:03:39.680 night. Every time you walk a straight
03:03:41.680 line through chaos. Every time you
03:03:44.080 imagine something greater than yourself
03:03:46.800 and try, however briefly, to build it.
03:03:49.760 Rome isn't coming back, but it never
03:03:52.160 really left. Its laws became our laws.
03:03:55.359 Its failures became our warnings. Its
03:03:58.760 pride, our mirror, its
03:04:01.800 dust, part of our sky. And so we end not
03:04:06.160 with a monument or a crown, but with a
03:04:09.359 question. What will they remember of us?
03:04:12.399 What roads will we leave behind? You've
03:04:14.800 traveled far tonight. Through centuries
03:04:16.880 of marble and myth, through emperors and
03:04:20.200 exiles, through triumphs and collapse.
03:04:23.520 Let it all rest now. Let it settle like
03:04:26.080 ash from the last torch carried through
03:04:28.160 the forum. Let it sleep as Rome
03:04:31.720 sleeps. Deep in the earth, deep in
03:04:34.640 memory. Tomorrow will come. But for now,
03:04:38.160 close your eyes and let the Empire fade.
