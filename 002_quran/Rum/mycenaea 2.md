* Storage rooms surrounded the core, with upper terraces for workshops, armories, and granaries.
* Grave stelae depicted:

  * Chariot warfare
  * Lion hunts (matched by inlaid dagger from Grave 4: gold/niello lion on silver)

### **Aftermath (1100–800 BCE) – Dark Age and Cultural Memory**

* No more Linear B after 1180 BCE; script disappears
* Hilltop hamlets and local chiefs replace palatial centers
* Survivals:

  * Burial at Leuctra includes Mycenaean-style gold ring (c. 1050 BCE)
  * Field divisions at Nichoria mirror palace layouts
  * Terms like *wanax* and *basileus* evolve in dialect
* Oral Tradition:

  * Aoidoi (bards) replace scribes

* Pottery:

  * Geometric designs replicate palace frescoes
  * Reused tholos stones for new village architecture
* Hero cults:

  * Offerings at ancient tombs (e.g., Ajax at Salamis)
* Memory Persistence:

  * Meander motifs
  * Burial styles
  * Furnace orientation

### **Modern Rediscovery (19th–20th Century)**

* 1876: Heinrich Schliemann excavates Mycenae

  * Finds gold mask (misidentified as Agamemnon)
* 1939: Carl Blegen uncovers Pylos archive (burnt tablets)
* 1952: Michael Ventris deciphers Linear B

  * Confirms it as an early form of Greek
* Tablets reveal:

  * Scribes tracked tribute, weapons, livestock
  * Linear B names: *wanax*, *laoagetes*, *cleos*
  * Evidence of organized administration and military logistics
