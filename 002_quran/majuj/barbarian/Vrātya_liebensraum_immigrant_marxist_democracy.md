# marx nietzsche democracy
was marx an immigrant laborer?

The model of democracy was pushed by immigrant laborers. So it is fitting that to this day democratic rulers use immigrants to rally for them.

Marxist may deride conservatives as deriving their political ideologies from nietzsche. But they are one of its proponents. At least nietzsche's liebensraum.

Marxists blame the capitalist class for the problem of the laborers. But they do not blame the pushers of potentialist liebensraumers.
