Moment is the maximum amount of experience we can process at once

The ability to process the entire universe in one moment or flash of experience is expected of a god who claims to be potentate over everything 

God's yawm is our 1000 years

Does it mean God can at most perceive 1000 years at his one moment?

Or even less?
