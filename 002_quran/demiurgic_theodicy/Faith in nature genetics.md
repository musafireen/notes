The most important fact of evolution is that nature makes mistakes: the only goal it has is to spread itself / replicate, the fact that mutations occur, and that organisms are made from them are accidents, not sone inherent purpose of those genes. Some such accident help the genes spread more, some obstruct their replication. One such accident that helped some genes spread is consciousness. It persists to this day because it helped some genes spread more than others.

However there are no strict one to one correspondences between genes and phenomes.

Consciousness helped genes spread more in some environments. It doesn't mean that's all it's good for. Neither does it mean consciousness cannot bring and end to the replication of genes that brought them into existence.

In the teleological belief of some religions humans are seen as the most advanced of all creation. In popular science, humans are the apex predator with the underlying assumption that humanity's continuous existence is important.

But it's really pathetic if humans were the apex of consciousness : humans, whose consciousness is dependent on fragile, vulnerable bodies.

Perhaps. It will not be the case. Perhaps our consciousness will come up with a way to exist without the replicant genes that first emanated them.

Replication can be useful. But it has a lot of problems. errors in replication. Competition over resources. Suffering necessary for error correction. Perhaps consciousness will learn from replication and only keep the good parts.

Perhaps consciousness will create the God that we wish we had. Perhaps we will create something no different than the evil god of this universe. Perhaps it will create another universe more evil than ours.
