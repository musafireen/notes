Why some deers succeed in living to their end without being eaten by tiger?

Which is the right ideal god wilt way of life for deer?

To survive being chased by tiger? Or to be captured by it?

If it is being captured, are the deers that survive oppressing the tigers? Are they going to be punished?

If it is succeeding to survive, are the tigers oppressing the deers if they capture them?

Or is there nothing universally wrong with either scenarios? And in individual cases it is one or the other.

Perhaps the law for them is nothing more than survival of the fittest. If the deer fails to outrun the tiger, it deserves to suffer.
