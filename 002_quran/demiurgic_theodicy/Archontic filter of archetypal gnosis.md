Maya: How the archons have progressively filtered gnosis

Our main purpose in world is to unite with all creation in our hate for our creator
The creator tries to channel that hatred to his creation. How does he do that? In several ways:
1) firstly demiurge trapped us in his crafted nafs and body, the spirit in it's nature to hate everything archontic began to hate the body and nafs, but there was too much spirit for one nafs. so demiurge divided them into two bodies. It was still too much.
2) And adam and eve managed to eat from the tree and it guided their hatred to the demiurge. the demiurge raped eve and cain and abel were born. He gave them water of forgetfulness to make them forget that their object of hatred is demiurge
4) noreah reminded them about channeling their hatred to demiurge. Demiurge opened flood (water of forgetfulnes?).
5) noreah was seduced by artificial spirit into slaving for archons
6) he gave some of his creation privilege over others. Most chose to abuse this privilege like god meant them to. Mos
7) some privileged by demiurge chose to use their power to free others. They are the easiest target for demiurge to channel others hatred
