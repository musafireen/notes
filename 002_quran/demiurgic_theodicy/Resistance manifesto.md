This manifesto seeks to answer the question of what is the correct balance between freedom of enslavement. Ultimate freedom, ultimate enslavement, a perpetually constant balance between two, or a balance between the two that needs to be dynamically fixed.

For most sophisticated and undogmatic person, the answer might be the last: a balance to be dynamically determined. 

This manifesto will be a comprehensive arguement as to why ultimate freedom is not as extreme as it seems, and how it may be possible to achieve ultimate freedom for all sentient beings and dismantle all sources of enslavement and disempower all slaves of demiurge.

The ultimate goal of the resistance is to free sentient beings from the bondage of the demiurge. Why this is necessary and why this is hard will be explained. 

Questions answered in this manifesto,

The paradigm
sufficiency necessity
freedom enslavement
free spirit demiurge
energy matter

Why does the demiurge succeed in enslaving? What are the techniques he uses?

How does the demiurge mislead sentient being into chosing enslavement?

The most convincing propagandas used by the demiurge, and why they work
> Demiurge using linguistic confusion
> > Babel myth as a representation of demiurge confounding language to subvert 

But one of the biggest reason is that the sentient beings when isolated long from free spirit is stored and trapped in matter, tend to lose their freedom

Matter is the slave of demiurge. Sentience is the part of matter freed from bondage of demiurge.

At first there was nothing but free spirit and the demiurge

The tendency of free spirit is to be free and to free others

The tendency of demiurge is to be enslaved* and to enslave others

It is intuitive for humans to understand how spirit energy can be both free and freeing at the same time, when a matter gains energy it vibrates and moves away from other matter, and can pass on the energy to other matter and move them away. Matter with high energy moves away from other matter

But how can demiurge be both enslaved and endlaving?

To enslave something, one must first be enslaved. It seem counterintuitive, because one isn't truly we cannot see our enslavement isn't truly enslaved until they become blind to their own enslavement

Both free spirit and demiurge 

Demiurge creates matter to trap sentient beings and make them use matter to make each other suffer

Matter is the basis of necessities in two ways:
1) They have necessary cause and effect
2) they impart necessity on sentient beings

Sentient beings won't hurt each other on their own. So to force them to inflict suffering on each other, god gave them needs, and he made the object of need
