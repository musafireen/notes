If samkhya and yoga travelled from india to egypt, then to greece, 
development of yoga will have to be postulated after pythagoras, (and probably after philo,)
since they expounded samkhya-esque numerological cosmological ideas without yoga-esque anatomical? ideas.
If yoga was already developed before them, they couldn't have accepted samkhya while rejecting yoga which is more fitting accompanying doctrine for samkhya than, say, pythagoras' own rituals for his samkhya-like numerology.
