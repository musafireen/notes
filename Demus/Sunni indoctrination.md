The fallacy of sunni tradition is apparent to outsiders but, even to people who leave sunni religion have hard time spotting the fallacy in their perception of sunni as orthodox

Shi'ism too strict: makes unrealistic demands from followers. Therefore failed to gain widespread acceptance.

Kharijism demonized by both shi'as and sunnism due to stricter criteria of orthodoxy. It is the least followed.

Sunnism gained prominence early on due to laxity it provided in 2 areas:
1) sanction on abuse of power by the powerful

Fitna fallacy: sunnis

2) sanction for weaker followers in downright worshipping any powerful abuser they liked. 

Early sunnis felt no problem making up narration to support whichever powerful people, vested interest and popular trends they liked.

It's hard to ignore their lack of belief and oppurtunism (nifƒÅq) in the sanction of abuse promised by the ruling rashidun authority.

The blatantly false oppurtunistic hadith that helped legitimized the Rashidun caliphs: 

The oppurtunist qurayshi mafia of medina canonizing hajj rituals

Exonyms: 

Bakri: due to their following the multitude of narrations tracing back to aisha alone, who was the daughter of abu bakr, both of whom were munafiqs according to shi'is.

Umari: sometimes sunnis are called umaris due to their worshipping of umar by following his terroristic and misogynistic mannerism

Amiri: due to their worship of powerful and popular amirs, by following their mannerism and getting outraged at the insult of these "heroes"

Taymawi: due to their following ibn taymiyya in vocal protest against people engaging in bid'ah

What is Islam: 
Quran: submit to allah
Umaris: submit to whoever prevails in a fitna

Motives:
To understand the motive of the sahabas, you just have to understand why the apostles of any other prophets betrayed them. Because more the apostles you can keep as faultless, the more bid'ahs you can claim to be valid on authority of those sahaba.

Mental condition of the victims of indoctrination:
They accept the chosing of sahaba by allah for their virtue withou any hadith or verse directly supporting it, ignoring any hadith against it and any quranic verse and common sense suggesting against it. But how is this kind of mentality created? Is it by childhood indoctrination?

If some of the sahabis were munafiqs why did Muhammad, Allah or other Muslim sahabis did not warn the believers?
