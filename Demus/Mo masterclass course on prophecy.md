make prophecies that makes even degenerate atheists believe

i am waraqa 7th century prophet. you might ask if i am a 7th century prophet, what am i doing here? well, i prophecied that i will be here, in 2023, making a master class, and then do this fart *farts*. and i wouldn't be the great prophet that i am if my failed to realize the prophecies that i made when i was delerious from desert exhaustion.

if you are such a great prophet, how come we don't know you? you might ask.

to which i can only say, 
that there is a small chance,
a 1.6 billion in 8 billion chance 
that you ALREADY believe my prophecy. 

well technically you believe in the prophecies of a prophet that i prophesized will become a prophet. 

so, you could say i am a prophet's prophet. 
kind of big deal if you understand these things, 
which you will if you follow this video till the end.

what kind of prophecies should you make, not the kind that doesn't benefit you if people believe in it.

first of all if you want to make prophecies that will benefit you without hurting someone, then this course isn't for you. if you want to be like one of those people like climate scientists that make prophecies to protect what people already have then go ahead. but i promise you, people will not respond to it as much as they will if they can take something from someone.

the oldest rule in the book is fearmongering, spread fear that someone will do something bad if something does not happen. for example you might need some land. you spread fear that the people who own it will do something bad if their land is not taken from them. but you can't tell directly that their land needs to be taken, you can say something needs to happen that will by chance lead to you getting what you want.
