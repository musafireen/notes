No it rejects tawallud of god
But uses anthropomorphism of god
Yada, fawh (face) of god

Were the poets  (in Q ?:?), and zƒÅnn speculators (in ?:?), attacked for anthropomorphists?

Why this hybrid stance on anthropologism?

Why anthropomorphism is attractive
Even if we lose all our memory, even our developped neural functions like sight and hearing, we will still retain a sense of our body

This sense of our body and its functions, the anthropomorphy is fundamental to the way we perceive the universe. This body sense probably existed since the womb even before our touch, smell, taste & vision developed.

The more a concept is different from our own scale and form, the harder it is for us to understand it, the more brain resources are required to store and process its functions.

So it makes sense to encode every new concept as a patch, a variation of the the unforgettably primal prototype, our own body. Like the way computer codes are minimized by reusing common variables, instead of creating new objects from scratch, instantiating from common prototype by reassigning only the differing parts, Like the way encoding a computer file reduces the size of a file and reduces the processing power and time required by encoding all the available bits as variations of the most common combination of bits in the entire file. Thus the human form and function is like the common combination of bits. 

When you are contemplating an object like nothing other, you have to create a new object from scratch. Even this unique object is based on a primal prototype. For javascript it is the object. For human subjective thought it is the body. Is machine language then objective thought?

This theory of the evolution of anthropologism is compatible with the religious rituals of most ancient and even modern societies. Most religious rituals promotes minimizing brain function, fasting, meditation in caves and high places, drug rituals, all promote brain atrophy, forcing the brain to function on lower resources, preserving more useful information by connecting it back to the central unforgettable concept: one's own body.

Encoding feels less necessary now with the prevalence of more hard drive resources. But it certainly doesn't harm to be prepared for the worst case scenario, if there is a shortage
