Kid you has just learnt that no matter what you do you can never be considered the best person in the world and that the closest thing you can do is to immitate the bearer of this message straight from your designer and creator, who has already won that title before the show is even over. You say okay, you are not created to be the best, you can at least immitate him. That's cool. You fifth sixth hand accounts of how he acted, but you wonder if you would have done a better job of noticing and passing on the wisdom of the actions and words of this messenger in a much more unfiltered way if you could have directly seen him, and have more oppurtunity to imitate the best man ever. But that can never happen. Because the best man only came to the world for a brief period of the entirity of human history and you missed it by 1400 years. Why couldn't you just been born at the right time? Where did you go wrong? Did you have a hand in this misfortune?
