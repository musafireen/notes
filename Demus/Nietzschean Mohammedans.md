*Poem of Nazrul praising Omar*

This was one of the poems that was great entertainment for children who had to read poems introduced by Islamist Nationalist lobby into National curriculum. One cannot help but appreciate the satirical value of a military commander who was so hated outside his victorious sycophant circle that until his death by assassination by his bodyguard, that he had to live in so much paranoia as to take so ingenious a form of precaution by placing someone else on his horse to see if any of the conquered people try to assassinate him. Of course the conquered people were smarter than he was plotting. 

But as the poem shows he killed two birds with one stone as lot of Amir-worshippers throughout the ages see this as a sincere act of altruism.

One movement that was full or such Amir-worshippers was the Nietzchean Mohammedans of early 20th century.

They proudly accepted the exonym Mohammedans, because they liked to be accepted as Mohammed was by the orientalists of the german military institutions they studied in.

Why the orientalists chose figures from outside their civilization to act as the mouthpiece for their own preferred ideologies and morals was an old story.

The beneficiaries of conquest viewed the conquered culture through the narrow lense of the luxury they enjoyed from the comquered culture. If there was a superior ideology, it would have to be the ideology of the people that could produce these luxuries. Nobody wants to believe that any sane ideology can come from their fellow men that they see everyday. It has to come from a mystified other.
