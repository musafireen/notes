There are several books that compile the works of critics of Islam from the Islamic Golden Age, including Al-Rawandi, Al-Razi, and others. Here are a few examples:

1. "The History of Islamic Theology: From Muhammad to the Present" by Jonathan A.C. Brown. This book offers a comprehensive overview of the development of Islamic theology, including critical voices from the past.

2. "The Venture of Islam: Conscience and History in a World Civilization" by Marshall G.S. Hodgson. This three-volume series explores the history and intellectual traditions of Islam, including critical voices from the Islamic Golden Age.

3. "The Islamic Enlightenment: The Modern Struggle Between Faith and Reason" by Christopher de Bellaigue. This book explores the intellectual and cultural awakening that took place in the Muslim world during the 18th and 19th centuries, including critical perspectives on Islam from the past.

4. "The Cambridge Companion to Arabic Philosophy" edited by Peter Adamson and Richard C. Taylor. This collection of essays offers a comprehensive overview of the development of Arabic philosophy, including critical voices from the Islamic Golden Age.

It's worth noting that many of the works of critics of Islam from the Islamic Golden Age have been lost or destroyed over time, so it may not be possible to compile a truly comprehensive collection of their writings. Nonetheless, the books mentioned above are good resources for exploring this important aspect of Islamic intellectual history.



There are several modern books that contain collections of remnants of criticism of Islam from the so-called Islamic golden age. Here are a few examples:

2. "Islam Without Extremes: A Muslim Case for Liberty" by Mustafa Akyol. This book argues for a more liberal and tolerant interpretation of Islam, and includes a discussion of dissenting voices from Islamic history.

3. "What Went Wrong?: The Clash Between Islam and Modernity in the Middle East" by Bernard Lewis. This book examines the historical reasons for the Islamic world's failure to keep pace with the West in terms of political, economic, and cultural development, and includes a discussion of critical voices from the Islamic golden age.

4. "The First Muslim: The Story of Muhammad" by Lesley Hazleton. This book provides a historical account of the life of the Prophet Muhammad, and includes a discussion of the challenges he faced from critics and skeptics during his lifetime.

These books, among others, provide valuable insights into the history of Islamic thought and the challenges faced by critical voices in the Islamic world.
