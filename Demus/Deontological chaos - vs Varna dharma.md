Doing something with the view what if everyone did it.

What if everyone avoided being doctor, engineer.

Varna system avoids this thought. It turns the question to what if everyone left the profession of their father.

You find the valuable role that is easier for you than for anyone else.

In varna inheriting the profession becomes easy because of inheriting tools and education from father.

This is different from capitalism, because of acquisition of the knowledge of means results in the society getting better service than if someone else inherited the means.
