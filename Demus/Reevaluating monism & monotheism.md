Historically, the beginning of empires started the move from polytheism to henotheism. It also started the move to monism of the chaos. Later interaction between philosophical monism and theological henotheism produced monism.

Plato

Plotinus

Spinoza

Kant believed multiplicity cannot exist only in time and space.

But why? We have no knowledge of what exists beyond time and space. How can we know whether multiplicity is possible beyond space-time or not

If one thing can exist withou being created, why can't other things also exist as swayambhuva?

Lack of chaos is not a good arguement.

Because:
1) they haven't really demonstrated that chaos does not exist
2) they haven't shown that existence of more than one self-existing being must necessarily lead to chaos
2b) it's more likely that more than one self-existing beings would not only be able to exist without chaos, rather it is more likey they cannot even know about each other by default, let alone enter into conflict.

To understand this, first we have to see why and how conflict occurs. Conflict not only needs motives but also, sufficient will and method by which to carry out the will for conflict.

We enter into conflict because we want something to be more favorable to us than others.

Can self-existing beings have motives to enter into conflict?

To have a motive for conflict, the two must first know each other. But how can two self-existing beings know each other. We only know and take action on each other by relaying energy through space-time.

We have a common space-time in which we are both agents. Deistically, our actions of knowledge, and conflict are mediated by the god which is common between us. we borrow our properties from the same god. Our actions are mediated through our creator, the consequences are determined by this creator.

Two beings that are self-existent, don't have such mediating principle. They cannot make each other the object of their actions, even when the action is knowing.

Master-slave vs. father son

Doesn't master slave relation imply god having necessity of slaves? All masters need slaves for something.
