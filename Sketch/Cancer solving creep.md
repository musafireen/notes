Girl annoyed by stalker creep
Gets cancer
Some mysterious man offers to pay for treatment
She accepts
After she is cured
She is visited by stalker
Stalker asks her to marry him
Stalker brings judge
Proves he gave the money
Claims she owes him her life
Wants to make her suffer
Judge agrees
"If you say he is evil for wanting to punish you for refusing to obeying him after finding out he gave you cancer that he paid to get treated, you are saying god is evil for wanting to punish you for refusing to obey him because he gave you the needs and responsibilities for which he gave you the means to fulfil.

He could have given you cancer and then not pay for the treatment, you ungrateful bitch.

God could have created you with needs and responsibilites and not give you the means to fulfil them, you ungrateful bitch
