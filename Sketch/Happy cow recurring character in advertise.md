Happy cow recurring character in advertise cow products in the middle of other skits, 

Until one episode when happy cow 2 comes into a skit instead o happy cow 1.

A skit character asks if it changed anything.

Hc2: well i hope nothing changed, except my body and my soul.


Next episode starts with:

happy cows advertizing their own products

Child: mom, i don't wanna eat meat, if it comes from another sentient being.

HC1: nothing makes me more happy than when you eat my meat

Not animation, but actual happy cow actor

Happy cow 1 smiling on top of a tall building

Cows are genetically modified to be always happy, even when they are being sacrificed

HC1 smiling broken at the street.

Cleaner: too bad we can't eat it now.
