Adult workers: *in beautiful streamlined process, working quietly*

Massive baby character: *enters and starts working loud*

Mbc: you think you have more rights than me?

Cancer cell: you have more rights than me? I am a cancer cell yet to be born. My opinion matters more than yours.

Cancer cell supporter: yeah, if you don't like cancer, you should have thought about it before you got cancer. Prevention, not cure.

MbC: oy, i don't like being compared to you folks. unlike you i have massive potentials. Let's see I can grow up to buy 10 cars, force all homeless people to work from the government or my private jobs, and buy homes. And i am naturally cute to humans.

CC: if you have more rights, i want to be transpla ted onto you, not this adult rightless woman.

Mbc: oy, stay away from me.

Babyslayer: *enters*

MCC: oy, did you just pass by me without helping me from this cancer? you think you can refuse a chance to gather audience sympathy by showing random acts of kindness towards babies and still remain uncancelled?

BS: *slays*
