SUMMARY: Fragment 61 states that Orpheus calls Phanes the “son of the God,” and that Dionysus is addressed as Phanes and "son of God," and, directly quoting the Fourth Rhapsody, he urges Mousaios to remember these things as they are ancient and from Phanes.

 

61. Θεοσοφία Αριστόκριτου  61 p. 116, 15 Buresch (cf. supra p. 141):

 

ὅτι ἐν πολλοῖς Φάνητα φερωνύμως ὁ Ὀρφεὺς προσαγορεύει τὸν μονογενῆ, τὸν υἱὸν τοῦ θεοῦ. 

“In many places Orphéfs (Ὀρφεύς) addresses well-named Phánîs (Φάνης) as the only-begotten, the son of the God. 

οἴεται γὰρ αὐτῶι πρέπειν τὸ ὄνομα ὡς ἀϊδίως καὶ ἀοράτως πανταχοῦ φαίνοντι καὶ ὡς πᾶσι τὸ ἐκ μὴ ὄντων φανῆναι παρασχομένῳ. 

For he thinks the name is fitting: “everlasting” and “invisible” in making all appear everywhere; and thus, he produced all this from non-existing things, making (all) appear. 

### p117
μεμνημένος οὖν πολλαχῇ τοῦ μυθευομένου Διός |117 Bur. καὶ τοῦ Διονύσου, ὃν Φάνητα προσαγορεύει, δημιουργὸν πάντων αὐτὸν εἰσάγει τὸν Φάνητα ὡσανεὶ τὸν τοῦ θεοῦ υἱόν, δὶ’ οὗ τὰ πάντα ἐφάνη, διὸ καὶ ἐν τῆι τετάρτηι ῥαψωιδίαι πρὸς Μουσαῖον οὕτω λέγει·

In fact, this calls to mind in many ways Zefs (Ζεὺς), of whom so much is said, and of Diónysos, whom he calls Phánîs, who he introduces as the Dimiourgós (Demiurge) of all, as Phánîs, as it were, the son of God, he who makes all appear, wherefore he (Ὀρφεύς) says to Mousaios in the Fourth Rhapsody:

ταῦτα νόωι πεφύλαξο, φίλον τέκος, ἐν πραπίδεσσιν,

εἰδός περ μάλα παλαίφατα κἀπὸ Φάνητος

“These things keep watch in your mind, beloved child, and in your heart, knowing very well they are ancient and from Phánîs.” (trans. by the author)
