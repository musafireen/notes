λέγεται δέ τι καὶ ἕτερον ἐπὶ τῆς Ταρκυνίου δυναστείας πάνυ θαυμαστὸν εὐτύχημα τῇ Ῥωμαίων ὑπάρξαι πόλει εἴτε θεῶν τινος εἴτε δαιμόνων εὐνοίᾳ δωρηθέν: ὅπερ οὐ πρὸς ὀλίγον καιρόν, ἀλλ᾽ εἰς ἅπαντα τὸν βίον πολλάκις αὐτὴν ἔσωσεν ἐκ μεγάλων κακῶν.

It is also said that during the reign of Tarquinius, a very wondrous fortune befell the city of the Romans, whether through the favor of some god or divine being: this fortune, not only for a short time but throughout its entire existence, often saved the city from great calamities.

[2] γυνή τις ἀφίκετο πρὸς τὸν τύραννον οὐκ ἐπιχωρία βύβλους ἐννέα μεστὰς Σιβυλλείων χρησμῶν ἀπεμπολῆσαι θέλουσα. οὐκ ἀξιοῦντος δὲ τοῦ Ταρκυνίου τῆς αἰτηθείσης τιμῆς πρίασθαι τὰς βύβλους ἀπελθοῦσα τρεῖς ἐξ αὐτῶν κατέκαυσε: καὶ μετ᾽ οὐ πολὺν χρόνον τὰς λοιπὰς ἓξ ἐνέγκασα τῆς αὐτῆς ἐπώλει τιμῆς. δόξασα δ᾽ ἄφρων τις εἶναι καὶ γελασθεῖσα ἐπὶ τῷ τὴν αὐτὴν τιμὴν αἰτεῖν περὶ τῶν ἐλαττόνων, ἣν οὐδὲ περὶ τῶν πλειόνων ἐδυνήθη λαβεῖν, ἀπελθοῦσα πάλιν τὰς ἡμισείας τῶν ἀπολειπομένων κατέκαυσε καὶ τὰς λοιπὰς [p. 104]

A woman, not a native of the region, came to the tyrant [Tarquinius], desiring to sell nine books filled with Sibylline oracles. When Tarquinius refused to purchase them at the price she demanded, the woman departed and burned three of the books. Not long afterward, she returned with the remaining six and offered them at the same price as before. Thinking her to be mad and mocking her for asking the same price for fewer books than she originally offered, the king again refused. The woman left again and burned three more books. She then returned with the remaining three, demanding the same amount of gold as before.

[3] τρεῖς ἐνέγκασα τὸ ἴσον ᾔτει χρυσίον. θαυμάσας δὴ τὸ βούλημα τῆς γυναικὸς ὁ Ταρκύνιος τοὺς οἰωνοσκόπους μετεπέμψατο καὶ διηγησάμενος αὐτοῖς τὸ πρᾶγμα, τί χρὴ πράττειν, ἤρετο. κἀκεῖνοι διὰ σημείων τινῶν μαθόντες, ὅτι θεόπεμπτον ἀγαθὸν ἀπεστράφη, καὶ μεγάλην συμφορὰν ἀποφαίνοντες τὸ μὴ πάσας αὐτὸν τὰς βύβλους πρίασθαι, ἐκέλευσαν ἀπαριθμῆσαι τῇ γυναικὶ τὸ χρυσίον, ὅσον ᾔτει καὶ τοὺς περιόντας τῶν χρησμῶν λαβεῖν.

Tarquinius, astonished at the woman’s behavior, summoned the augurs and, after recounting the matter to them, asked what he should do. The augurs, having determined through certain signs that the offering was a divinely sent gift and warning of a great calamity if the remaining books were not purchased, advised him to pay the woman the gold she requested and take possession of the remaining oracles.

[4] ἡ μὲν οὖν γυνὴ τὰς βύβλους δοῦσα καὶ φράσασα τηρεῖν ἐπιμελῶς ἐξ ἀνθρώπων ἠφανίσθη, Ταρκύνιος δὲ τῶν ἀστῶν ἄνδρας ἐπιφανεῖς δύο προχειρισάμενος καὶ δημοσίους αὐτοῖς θεράποντας δύο παραζεύξας ἐκείνοις ἀπέδωκε τὴν τῶν βιβλίων φυλακήν, ὧν τὸν ἕτερον Μάρκον Ἀτίλιον ἀδικεῖν τι δόξαντα περὶ τὴν πύστιν καταμηνυθέντα ὑφ᾽ ἑνὸς τῶν δημοσίων, ὡς πατροκτόνον εἰς ἀσκὸν ἐνράψας βόειον ἔρριψεν εἰς τὸ πέλαγος.

The woman, after delivering the books and advising that they be carefully guarded, vanished from human sight. Tarquinius then appointed two prominent men from among the citizens as their custodians, assigning two public servants to assist them in their duties. Of these custodians, one, Marcus Atilius, was accused of wrongdoing in his custodianship, denounced by one of the public servants as a parricide, and was sewn into an ox-hide sack and cast into the sea.

[5] μετὰ δὲ τὴν ἐκβολὴν τῶν βασιλέων ἡ πόλις ἀναλαβοῦσα τὴν τῶν χρησμῶν προστασίαν ἄνδρας τε τοὺς ἐπιφανεστάτους ἀποδείκνυσιν αὐτῶν φύλακας, οἳ διὰ βίου ταύτην ἔχουσι τὴν ἐπιμέλειαν στρατειῶν ἀφειμένοι καὶ τῶν ἄλλων τῶν κατὰ πόλιν πραγματειῶν, καὶ δημοσίους αὐτοῖς παρακαθίστησιν, ὧν χωρὶς οὐκ ἐπιτρέπει τὰς ἐπισκέψεις τῶν χρησμῶν τοῖς ἀνδράσι ποιεῖσθαι. συνελόντι δ᾽ εἰπεῖν οὐδὲν οὕτω Ῥωμαῖοι φυλάττουσιν οὔθ᾽ ὅσιον κτῆμα οὔθ᾽ ἱερὸν ὡς τὰ Σιβύλλεια θέσφατα. χρῶνται δ᾽ αὐτοῖς, [p. 105] ὅταν ἡ βουλὴ ψηφίσηται, στάσεως καταλαβούσης τὴν πόλιν ἢ δυστυχίας τινὸς μεγάλης συμπεσούσης κατὰ πόλεμον ἢ τεράτων τινῶν καὶ φαντασμάτων μεγάλων καὶ δυσευρέτων αὐτοῖς φανέντων, οἷα πολλάκις συνέβη. οὗτοι διέμειναν οἱ χρησμοὶ μέχρι τοῦ Μαρσικοῦ κληθέντος πολέμου κείμενοι κατὰ γῆς ἐν τῷ ναῷ τοῦ Καπιτωλίνου Διὸς ἐν λιθίνῃ λάρνακι, ὑπ᾽ ἀνδρῶν δέκα φυλαττόμενοι.

After the expulsion of the kings, the city took over the guardianship of the oracles, appointing the most distinguished men as their custodians. These men held this responsibility for life, exempt from military service and other civic duties, and were provided public assistants. These assistants were not allowed to inspect the oracles without the custodians' presence. To summarize, the Romans guarded nothing—neither sacred possession nor holy treasure—as carefully as the Sibylline oracles. They consulted them only when the Senate decreed it, whether due to civil strife, a great misfortune in war, or the appearance of unusual and difficult-to-interpret omens, as often happened. These oracles remained preserved until the so-called Marsic War, stored underground in the temple of Capitoline Jupiter in a stone chest, guarded by ten men."

[6] μετὰ δὲ τὴν τρίτην ἐπὶ ταῖς ἑβδομήκοντα καὶ ἑκατὸν ὀλυμπιάσιν ἐμπρησθέντος τοῦ ναοῦ, εἴτ᾽ ἐξ ἐπιβουλῆς, ὡς οἴονταί τινες, εἴτ᾽ ἀπὸ ταὐτομάτου, σὺν τοῖς ἄλλοις ἀναθήμασι τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ οὗτοι διεφθάρησαν ὑπὸ τοῦ πυρός. οἱ δὲ νῦν ὄντες ἐκ πολλῶν εἰσι συμφορητοὶ τόπων, οἱ μὲν ἐκ τῶν ἐν Ἰταλίᾳ πόλεων κομισθέντες, οἱ δ᾽ ἐξ Ἐρυθρῶν τῶν ἐν Ἀσίᾳ, κατὰ δόγμα βουλῆς τριῶν ἀποσταλέντων πρεσβευτῶν ἐπὶ τὴν ἀντιγραφήν: οἱ δ᾽ ἐξ ἄλλων πόλεων καὶ παρ᾽ ἀνδρῶν ἰδιωτῶν μεταγραφέντες: ἐν οἷς εὑρίσκονταί τινες ἐμπεποιημένοι τοῖς Σιβυλλείοις, ἐλέγχονται δὲ ταῖς καλουμέναις ἀκροστιχίσι: λέγω δ᾽ ἃ Τερέντιος Οὐάρρων ἱστόρηκεν ἐν τῇ θεολογικῇ πραγματείᾳ.

After the temple burned down in the 3rd year of the 187th Olympiad (83 BCE), whether through conspiracy, as some believe, or by accident, the oracles, along with the other offerings to the god, were destroyed by fire. The current ones were gathered from many places, some brought from cities in Italy, others from Erythrae in Asia, collected by three envoys sent by the Senate to make copies, and others transcribed from various cities and individuals. Among these were some forged Sibylline writings, which were detected through what are called acrostics. I recount this as Terentius Varro recorded it in his theological treatise.
