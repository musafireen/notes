“ [109] Assumit autem Cratippus hoc modo: 'Sunt autem innumerabiles praesensiones non fortuitae.' At ego dico nullam. vide, quanta sit controversia. iam assumptione non concessa nulla conclusio est. 'At impudentes sumus qui, cum tam perspicuum sit, non concedamus.' Quid est 'perspicuum '? 'Multa vera,' inquit, 'evadere.' Quid, quod multo [p. 494] plura falsa? nonne ipsa varietas, quae est propria fortunae, fortunam esse causam, non naturam esse docet? deinde, si tua ista conclusio, Cratippe, vera est—tecum enim mihi res est—non intellegis eadem uti posse et haruspices et fulguratores et interpretes ostentorum et augures et sortilegos et Chaldaeos? quorum generum nullum est ex quo non aliquid sicut praedictum sit evaserit. ergo aut ea quoque genera divinandi sunt, quae tu rectissime improbas, aut, si ea non sunt, non intellego cur haec duo sint quae relinquis. qua ergo ratione haec inducis, eadem illa possunt esse, quae tollis.

”

[109] "Cratippus states his minor premise thus: 'But there are countless instances of prophecies being fulfilled without the intervention of luck.' On the contrary, I say there isn't even one. Observe how keen the controversy grows! Now that the minor premise is denied the conclusion fails. But he retorts: ' You are unreasonable not to grant it, it is so evident.' Why 'evident'? 'Because many prophecies come true.' And what of the fact that many more don't [p. 495] come true? Does not this very uncertainty, which is characteristic of luck, demonstrate that their fulfilment is accounted for by luck and not by any law of nature? Furthermore, my dear Cratippus—for my controversy is with you—if that argument of yours is sound, don't you see that it is equally available in behalf of the means of divination practised by soothsayers, augurs, Chaldeans and by interpreters of lightnings, portents, and lots? For each of these classes will furnish you with at least one instance of a prophecy that came to pass. Therefore either they too are all means of divining—and this you very properly deny—or, if they are not, then, so far as I can see, the two classes which you permit to remain are not means of divining. Hence the same reasoning employed by you to establish the two kinds which you accept may be used to establish the others which you reject.

“ [110] 54. Quid vero habet auctoritatis furor iste, quem 'divinum' vocatis ut, quae sapiens non videat, ea videat insanus, et is qui humanos sensus amiserit divinos adsecutus sit? Sibyllae versus observamus, quos illa furens fudisse dicitur. quorum interpres nuper falsa quadam hominum fama dicturus in senatu putabatur eum, quem re vera regem habebamus, appellandum quoque esse regem, si salvi esse vellemus. hoc si est in libris, in quem hominem et in quod tempus est? callide enim, qui illa composuit, perfecit, ut, quodcumque accidisset, praedictum videretur hominum et temporum definitione sublata. [p. 496]
”

[110] 54. "But what weight is to be given to that frenzy of yours, which you term ' divine' and which enables the crazy man to see what the wise man does not see, and invests the man who has lost human intelligence with the intelligence of gods? We Romans venerate the verses of the Sibyl who is said to have uttered them while in a frenzy. Recently there was a rumour, which was believed at the time, but turned out to be false, that one of the interpreters1 of those verses was going to declare in the Senate that, for our safety, the man whom we had as king in fact should be made king also in name. If this is in the books, to what man and to what time does it refer? For it was clever in the author to take care that whatever happened should appear foretold because all reference to persons or time had been [p. 497] omitted.

1 Lucius Cotta, one of the quindecimviri who had charge of the verses. This story is told by Suetonius in his lul. Caesar, ch. 79. It was said that according to the Sibylline verses the Parthians could only be conquered by a king and therefore that Caesar should be called king. Plutarch, Caesar, ch. 60 and 64.

Sed ut ad Graecos referam orationem, quibus carere hoc quidem in sermonis genere non possumus —

But to direct my remarks to the Greeks, (whom we cannot omit in a dissertation of this nature; 

nam ut virtutis a nostris, sic doctrinae sunt ab illis exempla petenda—septem fuisse dicuntur uno tempore, qui sapientes et haberentur et vocarentur: 

for as examples of virtue are to be sought among our own countrymen, so examples of learning are to be derived from them;) seven are said to have lived at one time, who were esteemed and called wise men. 

hi omnes praeter Milesium Thalen civitatibus suis praefuerunt. 

All these men, except Thales of Miletus, governed their respective cities. 

Quis doctior eisdem temporibus illis aut cuius eloquentia litteris instructior fuisse traditur quam Pisistrati? 

Whose learning is reported, at the same period, to have been greater, or whose eloquence to have received more ornament from literature, than that of Pisistratus? - 

qui primus Homeri libros confusos antea sic disposuisse dicitur, ut nunc habemus. 

who is said to have been the first that arranged the books of Homer as we now have them, when they were previously confused. 

Non fuit ille quidem civibus suis utilis, sed ita eloquentia floruit, ut litteris doctrinaque praestaret.

He was not indeed of any great service to the community, but was eminent for eloquence, and at the same time he excelled in erudition and liberal knowledge.

Videte quanta religio fuerit apud Segestanos. 

See how great the reverence was among the Segestans. 

Repertum esse, iudices, scitote neminem, neque liberum neque servum, neque civem neque peregrinum, qui illud signum auderet attingere; 

Know, judges, that no one was found—neither free nor slave, neither citizen nor foreigner—who dared to touch that statue.

barbaros quosdam Lilybaeo scitote adductos esse operarios; ii denique illud ignari totius negoti ac religionis mercede accepta sustulerunt. 

Know that some foreign laborers were brought in from Lilybaeum; these men, entirely ignorant of the whole matter and of its sacred nature, removed it for pay.

Quod cum ex oppido exportabatur, quem conventum mulierum factum esse arbitramini, quem fletum maiorum natu? 

When it was being carried out of the town, what sort of gathering of women do you think took place? What weeping among the elders? 

quorum non nulli etiam illum diem memoria tenebant cum illa eadem Diana Segestam Carthagine revecta victoriam populi Romani reditu suo nuntiasset. 

Some of them even remembered the day when that very statue of Diana, having been brought back from Carthage to Segesta, had announced the victory of the Roman people by her return.

Quam dissimilis hic dies illi tempori videbatur! 

How different that day seemed from the present! 

Tum imperator populi Romani, vir clarissimus, deos patrios reportabat Segestanis ex urbe hostium recuperatos: 

Then, a Roman general, a man of great distinction, was returning to the Segestans their ancestral gods, recovered from an enemy city; 

nunc ex urbe sociorum praetor eiusdem populi turpissimus atque impurissimus eosdem illos deos nefario scelere auferebat. 

now, from an allied city, a most vile and corrupt praetor of that same Roman people was stealing those same gods through a criminal act.

Quid hoc tota Sicilia est clarius, quam omnis Segestae matronas et virgines convenisse cum Diana exportaretur ex oppido, unxisse unguentis, complesse coronis et floribus, ture, odoribus incensis usque ad agri finis prosecutas esse?

What is more well-known in all of Sicily than that all the matrons and maidens of Segesta gathered together when Diana was being taken from the town, anointed her with perfumes, adorned her with garlands and flowers, and accompanied her with incense and fragrant offerings all the way to the borders of their land?

#### 4.103
 Insula est Melita, iudices, satis lato a Sicilia1 mari periculosoque diiuncta2; in qua est eodem nomine oppidum, quo iste numquam accessit, quod tamen3 isti textrinum per triennium ad muliebrem vestem conficiendam fuit. ab eo oppido non longe in promunturio fanum est Iunonis antiquum, quod tanta religione semper fuit ut non modo illis Punicis bellis quae in his fere locis navali copia gesta atque versata sunt, sed etiam hac4 praedonum multitudine semper inviolatum sanctumque fuerit. quin etiam hoc memoriae proditum est, classe quondam Masinissae regis ad eum locum adpulsa praefectum regium dentis eburneos incredibili magnitudine e fano sustulisse et eos in Africam portasse Masinissaeque donasse. Regem primo delectatum esse munere; post, ubi audisset unde essent, statim certos homines in quinqueremi misisse ui eos dentis reponerent5. itaque in iis scriptum6 litteris Punicis fuit regem Masinissam imprudentem accepisse, re cognita reportandos reponendosque7 curasse. erat praeterea magna vis eboris, multa ornamenta, in quibus eburneae victoriae antiquo opere ac summa arte perfectae.

There is an island called Melita, O judges, separated from Sicily by a sufficiently wide and perilous navigation, in which there is a town of the same name, to which Verres never went, though it was for three years a manufactory to him for weaving women's garments. Not far from that town, on a promontory, is an ancient temple of Juno, which was always considered so holy, that it was not only always kept inviolate and sacred in those Punic wars, which in those regions were carried on almost wholly by the naval forces, but even by the bands of pirates which ravage those seas. Moreover, it has been handed down to us by tradition, that once, when the fleet of King Masinissa was forced to put into these ports, the king's lieutenant took away some ivory teeth of an incredible size out of the temple, and carried them into Africa, and gave them to Masinissa; that at first the king was delighted with the present, but afterwards, when he heard where they had come from, he immediately sent trustworthy men in a quinquereme to take those teeth back; and that there was engraved on them in Punic characters, “that Masinissa the king had accepted them ignorantly; but that, when he knew the truth, he had taken care that they should be replaced and restored.” There was besides an immense quantity of ivory, and many ornaments, among which were some ivory victories of ancient workmanship, and wrought with exquisite skill.

Iam istuc quidem nihil negotii est, sed ego maiora molior.1

Now, indeed, there is no business, but I am thinking of greater things. 1 

Quo modo hoc nihil negotii est? aut quae sunt tandem ista maiora?

How does this not matter? or what are finally these greater things?

Quia, quoniam post mortem mali nihil est,2 ne mors quidem3 est malum, cui proxumum4 tempus est post mortem, in quo mali nihil esse concedis: ita ne moriendum quidem5 esse malum est; id67 est enim perveniendum esse ad id, quod non esse malum confitemur. [p. 226]

Because, since there is nothing evil after death, 2 not even death 3 is evil, to which the next 4 time is after death, in which you grant that there is nothing evil: thus it is not even evil to die. for that is to arrive at that which we confess not to be evil. [p. 226] 

Uberius ista, quaeso. haec enim spinosiora, prius ut confitear me cogunt quam ut adsentiar. sed quae sunt ea, quae dicis te maiora moliri?

More of that, please. for these things are more thorny, and force me to confess rather than to consent. but what are the things that you say you are trying to achieve? 

Ut doceam, si possim, non modo malum non esse, sed bonum etiam esse mortem.

To teach, if I may, not only that death is not evil, but also that death is good. 

Non postulo id quidem,8 aveo9 tamen audire. ut enim non efficias quod vis, tamen, mors ut malum non sit, efficies. sed nihil te interpellabo; continentem orationem audire malo.

I don't really need to hear that, 8 but I'd like to hear it. for you may not accomplish what you will, yet you will accomplish that death may not be evil. but I will not interrupt you in any way; I prefer to hear a continuous speech. 

Quid, si te rogavero10 aliquid?

What if I ask you something?

Magni autem est ingenii sevocare1 mentem a sensibus et cogitationem ab consuetudine2 abducere.34 itaque credo equidem etiam alios tot saeculis, sed quod5 litteris exstet,6 Pherecydes Syrius7 primus8 dixit animos esse hominum sempiternos, antiquus9 sane; fuit enim meo regnante gentili. hanc opinionem discipulus eius Pythagoras maxime confirmavit, qui cum Superbo regnante in Italiam venisset, tenuit Magnam illam Graeciam cum honore10 disciplina, tum etiam auctoritate, multaque saecula postea sic viguit Pythagoreorum nomen, ut nulli alii docti viderentur.11 sed redeo ad antiquos. rationem illi sententiae suae non fere reddebant, nisi quid erat numeris aut descriptionibus12 explicandum:

But it is a great skill to withdraw1 the mind from the senses and to divert the thought from habit2. 34 Therefore, I believe that others have also been doing it for so many centuries, but what5 exists in literature,6 Pherecydes Syrius7 was the first8 to say that the minds of men are eternal, an ancient9 of course; for it was in my reign of the Gentiles. this opinion was especially confirmed by his disciple Pythagoras, who came to Italy with the reigning Proud, held that Great Greece with honor10 discipline, and also with authority, and many centuries later the name of the Pythagoreans flourished in such a way that no other scholars were seen.11 But I return to the ancients. They generally did not give him the reason for their decision, except what had to be explained by numbers or descriptions:

Let us see what Æschylus says, who was not only a poet but a Pythagorean philosopher also, for that is the account which you have received of him; how doth he make Prometheus bear the pain he suffered for the Lemnian theft, when he clandestinely stole away the celestial fire, and bestowed it on men, and was severely punished by Jupiter for the theft. Fastened to Mount Caucasus, he speaks thus:

Thou heav’n-born race of Titans here fast bound,

Behold thy brother! As the sailors sound

With care the bottom, and their ships confine

To some safe shore, with anchor and with line;

So, by Jove’s dread decree, the God of fire

Confines me here the victim of Jove’s ire.

With baneful art his dire machine he shapes;

From such a God what mortal e’er escapes?

When each third day shall triumph o’er the night,

Then doth the vulture, with his talons light,

Seize on my entrails; which, in rav’nous guise,

He preys on! then with wing extended flies

Aloft, and brushes with his plumes the gore:

But when dire Jove my liver doth restore,

Back he returns impetuous to his prey,

Clapping his wings, he cuts th’ ethereal way.

Thus do I nourish with my blood this pest,

Confined my arms, unable to contest;

Entreating only that in pity Jove

Would take my life, and this cursed plague remove.

But endless ages past unheard my moan,

Sooner shall drops dissolve this very stone.32

And therefore it scarcely seems possible to avoid calling a man who is suffering, miserable; and if he is miserable, then pain is an evil.

Quae cum intuerer stupens, ut me recepi, Quid? hic, inquam, quis est, qui conplet aures meas tantus et tam dulcis sonus? 

After recovering from the astonishment with which I viewed these wonders, I said : "What is this loud and agreeable sound that fills my ears ? " **    

Hic est, inquit, ille, qui intervallis disiunctus inparibus, sed tamen pro rata parte ratione distinctis inpulsu et motu ipsorum orbium efficitur et acuta cum gravibus temperans varios aequabiliter concentus efficit; 

"That is produced," he replied, "by the onward rush and motion of the spheres themselves; the intervals between them, though unequal, being exactly arranged in a fixed proportion, by an agreeable blending of high and low tones various harmonies are produced; 

nec enim silentio tanti motus incitari possunt, et natura fert, ut extrema ex altera parte graviter, ex altera autem acute sonent. 

for such mighty motions cannot be carried on so swiftly in silence; and Nature has provided that one extreme shall produce low tones while the other gives forth high. 

Quam ob causam summus ille caeli stellifer cursus, cuius conversio est concitatior, acuto et excitato movetur sono, gravissimo autem hic lunaris atque infimus; 

Therefore this uppermost sphere of heaven, which bears the stars, as it revolves more rapidly, produces a high, shrill tone, whereas the lowest revolving sphere, that of the Moon, gives forth the lowest tone ; 

nam terra nona inmobilis manens una sede semper haeret complexa medium mundi locum. 

for the earthly sphere, the ninth, remains ever motionless and stationary in its position in the centre of the universe. 

Illi autem octo cursus, in quibus eadem vis est duorum, septem efficiunt distinctos intervallis sonos, qui numerus rerum omnium fere nodus est; 

But the other eight spheres, two of which move with the same velocity, produce seven different sounds, - a number which is the key of almost everything.

quod docti homines nervis imitati atque cantibus aperuerunt sibi reditum in hunc locum, sicut alii, qui praestantibus ingeniis in vita humana divina studia coluerunt.

Learned men, by imitating this harmony on stringed instruments and in song, have gained for themselves a return to this region, as others have obtained the same reward by devoting their brilliant intellects to divine pursuits during their earthly lives.
