 Insula est Melita, iudices, satis lato a Sicilia1 mari periculosoque diiuncta2; in qua est eodem nomine oppidum, quo iste numquam accessit, quod tamen3 isti textrinum per triennium ad muliebrem vestem conficiendam fuit. ab eo oppido non longe in promunturio fanum est Iunonis antiquum, quod tanta religione semper fuit ut non modo illis Punicis bellis quae in his fere locis navali copia gesta atque versata sunt, sed etiam hac4 praedonum multitudine semper inviolatum sanctumque fuerit. quin etiam hoc memoriae proditum est, classe quondam Masinissae regis ad eum locum adpulsa praefectum regium dentis eburneos incredibili magnitudine e fano sustulisse et eos in Africam portasse Masinissaeque donasse. Regem primo delectatum esse munere; post, ubi audisset unde essent, statim certos homines in quinqueremi misisse ui eos dentis reponerent5. itaque in iis scriptum6 litteris Punicis fuit regem Masinissam imprudentem accepisse, re cognita reportandos reponendosque7 curasse. erat praeterea magna vis eboris, multa ornamenta, in quibus eburneae victoriae antiquo opere ac summa arte perfectae.

There is an island called Melita, O judges, separated from Sicily by a sufficiently wide and perilous navigation, in which there is a town of the same name, to which Verres never went, though it was for three years a manufactory to him for weaving women's garments. Not far from that town, on a promontory, is an ancient temple of Juno, which was always considered so holy, that it was not only always kept inviolate and sacred in those Punic wars, which in those regions were carried on almost wholly by the naval forces, but even by the bands of pirates which ravage those seas. Moreover, it has been handed down to us by tradition, that once, when the fleet of King Masinissa was forced to put into these ports, the king's lieutenant took away some ivory teeth of an incredible size out of the temple, and carried them into Africa, and gave them to Masinissa; that at first the king was delighted with the present, but afterwards, when he heard where they had come from, he immediately sent trustworthy men in a quinquereme to take those teeth back; and that there was engraved on them in Punic characters, “that Masinissa the king had accepted them ignorantly; but that, when he knew the truth, he had taken care that they should be replaced and restored.” There was besides an immense quantity of ivory, and many ornaments, among which were some ivory victories of ancient workmanship, and wrought with exquisite skill.

Iam istuc quidem nihil negotii est, sed ego maiora molior.1

Now, indeed, there is no business, but I am thinking of greater things. 1 

Quo modo hoc nihil negotii est? aut quae sunt tandem ista maiora?

How does this not matter? or what are finally these greater things?

Quia, quoniam post mortem mali nihil est,2 ne mors quidem3 est malum, cui proxumum4 tempus est post mortem, in quo mali nihil esse concedis: ita ne moriendum quidem5 esse malum est; id67 est enim perveniendum esse ad id, quod non esse malum confitemur. [p. 226]

Because, since there is nothing evil after death, 2 not even death 3 is evil, to which the next 4 time is after death, in which you grant that there is nothing evil: thus it is not even evil to die. for that is to arrive at that which we confess not to be evil. [p. 226] 

Uberius ista, quaeso. haec enim spinosiora, prius ut confitear me cogunt quam ut adsentiar. sed quae sunt ea, quae dicis te maiora moliri?

More of that, please. for these things are more thorny, and force me to confess rather than to consent. but what are the things that you say you are trying to achieve? 

Ut doceam, si possim, non modo malum non esse, sed bonum etiam esse mortem.

To teach, if I may, not only that death is not evil, but also that death is good. 

Non postulo id quidem,8 aveo9 tamen audire. ut enim non efficias quod vis, tamen, mors ut malum non sit, efficies. sed nihil te interpellabo; continentem orationem audire malo.

I don't really need to hear that, 8 but I'd like to hear it. for you may not accomplish what you will, yet you will accomplish that death may not be evil. but I will not interrupt you in any way; I prefer to hear a continuous speech. 

Quid, si te rogavero10 aliquid?

What if I ask you something?

Magni autem est ingenii sevocare1 mentem a sensibus et cogitationem ab consuetudine2 abducere.34 itaque credo equidem etiam alios tot saeculis, sed quod5 litteris exstet,6 Pherecydes Syrius7 primus8 dixit animos esse hominum sempiternos, antiquus9 sane; fuit enim meo regnante gentili. hanc opinionem discipulus eius Pythagoras maxime confirmavit, qui cum Superbo regnante in Italiam venisset, tenuit Magnam illam Graeciam cum honore10 disciplina, tum etiam auctoritate, multaque saecula postea sic viguit Pythagoreorum nomen, ut nulli alii docti viderentur.11 sed redeo ad antiquos. rationem illi sententiae suae non fere reddebant, nisi quid erat numeris aut descriptionibus12 explicandum:

But it is a great skill to withdraw1 the mind from the senses and to divert the thought from habit2. 34 Therefore, I believe that others have also been doing it for so many centuries, but what5 exists in literature,6 Pherecydes Syrius7 was the first8 to say that the minds of men are eternal, an ancient9 of course; for it was in my reign of the Gentiles. this opinion was especially confirmed by his disciple Pythagoras, who came to Italy with the reigning Proud, held that Great Greece with honor10 discipline, and also with authority, and many centuries later the name of the Pythagoreans flourished in such a way that no other scholars were seen.11 But I return to the ancients. They generally did not give him the reason for their decision, except what had to be explained by numbers or descriptions:

Let us see what Æschylus says, who was not only a poet but a Pythagorean philosopher also, for that is the account which you have received of him; how doth he make Prometheus bear the pain he suffered for the Lemnian theft, when he clandestinely stole away the celestial fire, and bestowed it on men, and was severely punished by Jupiter for the theft. Fastened to Mount Caucasus, he speaks thus:

Thou heav’n-born race of Titans here fast bound,

Behold thy brother! As the sailors sound

With care the bottom, and their ships confine

To some safe shore, with anchor and with line;

So, by Jove’s dread decree, the God of fire

Confines me here the victim of Jove’s ire.

With baneful art his dire machine he shapes;

From such a God what mortal e’er escapes?

When each third day shall triumph o’er the night,

Then doth the vulture, with his talons light,

Seize on my entrails; which, in rav’nous guise,

He preys on! then with wing extended flies

Aloft, and brushes with his plumes the gore:

But when dire Jove my liver doth restore,

Back he returns impetuous to his prey,

Clapping his wings, he cuts th’ ethereal way.

Thus do I nourish with my blood this pest,

Confined my arms, unable to contest;

Entreating only that in pity Jove

Would take my life, and this cursed plague remove.

But endless ages past unheard my moan,

Sooner shall drops dissolve this very stone.32

And therefore it scarcely seems possible to avoid calling a man who is suffering, miserable; and if he is miserable, then pain is an evil.
