तणफासे सीयफासे य, तेउफासे य दंस-मसगे य । अहियासए सया समिए, फासाइं विरूवरूवाइं ॥

Always well guarded, he bore the pains (caused by) grass, cold, fire, flies, and gnats; manifold pains. (1)

अह दुच्चर-लाढमचारी, वज्जभूमिं च सुब्भ भूमिं च । पंतं सेज्जं सेविंसु, आसणगाणि चेव पंताइं ॥

He travelled in the pathless country of the Lāḍhas, in Vajjabhūmi and Subbhabhūmi[1]; he used there miserable beds and miserable seats. (2)

लोढेहिं तस्सुवसग्गा, बहवे जाणवया लूसिंसु । अह लूहदेसिए भत्ते, कुक्कुरा तत्थ हिंसिंसु णिवतिंसु ॥

In Lāḍha (happened) to him many dangers. Many natives attacked him. Even in the faithful part of the rough country[2] the dogs bit him, ran at him. (3)

अप्पे जणे णिवारेइ, लूसणए सुणए दसमाणे । छुछुकारंति आहंसु, समणं कुक्कुरा डसंतुत्ति ॥

Few people kept off the attacking, biting dogs. Striking the monk, they cried ‘Chucchū,’ and made the dogs bite him. (4)

एलिक्खए जणे भुज्जो, बहवे वज्जभूमि फरुसासी । लट्ठिं गहाय णालीयं, समणा तत्थ एव विहरिंसु ॥

Such were the inhabitants. Many other mendicants, eating rough food in Vajjabhūmi, and carrying about a strong pole or a stalk (to keep off the dogs), lived there. (5)

एवं पि तत्थ विहरंता, पुट्ठपुव्वा अहेसि सुणएहिं । संलुंचमाणा सुणएहिं, दुच्चरगाणि तत्थ लाढेहिं ॥

Even thus armed they were bitten by the dogs, torn by the dogs. It is difficult to travel in Lāḍha. (6) Ceasing to use the stick (i.e. cruelty) against living beings, abandoning the care of the body, the houseless (Mahāvīra), the Venerable One, endures the thorns of the villages (i.e. the abusive language of the peasants), (being) perfectly enlightened. (7)

निधाय दंडं पाणेहिं, तं कायं वोसज्जमणगारे । अह गामकंटए भगवं, ते अहियासए अभिसमेच्चा ॥

नाओ संगामसीसे वा, पारए तत्थ से महावीरे । एवं पि तत्थ लाढेहिं, अलद्धपुव्वो वि एगया गामो ॥

As an elephant at the head of the battle, so was Mahāvīra there victorious. Sometimes he did not reach a village there in Lāḍha. (8)

उवसंकमंतमपडिण्णं, गामंतियं पि अप्पत्तं । पडिणिक्खमित्तु लूसिंसु, एत्तो परं पलेहित्ति ॥

When he who is free from desires approached the village, the inhabitants met him on the outside, and attacked him, saying, ‘Get away from here.’ (9)

हयपुव्वो तत्थ दंडेण, अदुवा मुट्ठिणा अदु कुंताइ-फलेणं । अदु लेलुणा कवालेणं, हंता हंता बहवे कंदिंसु ॥

He was struck with a stick, the fist, a lance, hit with a fruit, a clod, a potsherd. Beating him again and again, many cried. (10)

मंसाणि छिन्नपुव्वाइं, उट्ठुभंति एगया कायं । परीसहाइं लुंचिंसु, अहवा पसुणा अवकिरिंसु ॥

When he once (sat) without moving his body, they cut his flesh[3], tore his hair under pains, or covered him with dust. (11)

उच्चालइय णिहणिंसु, अदुवा आसणाओ खलइंसु । वोसट्ठकाए पणयासी, दुक्खसहे भगवं अपडिण्णे ॥

Throwing him up, they let him fall, or disturbed him in his religious postures; abandoning the care of his body, the Venerable One humbled himself and bore pain, free from desire. (1 2)

सूरो संगामसीसे वा, संवुडे तत्थ से महावीरे । पडिसेवमाणे फरुसाइं, अचले भगवं रीइत्था ॥

As a hero at the head of the battle is surrounded on all sides[4], so was there Mahāvīra. Bearing all hardships, the Venerable One, undisturbed, proceeded (on the road to Nirvāṇa). (13)

This is the rule which has often been followed, &c.
