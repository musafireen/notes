Prajāpatir vai svāṃ duhitaram abʰyadʰyāyad,
divam ity anya āhur Uṣasam ity anye.
tām r̥śyo bʰūtvā rohitam bʰūtām abʰyait.
taṃ devā apaśyann: ākr̥taṃ vai Prajāpatiḥ karotīti.
te tam aicʰan ya enam āriṣyaty, etam anyonyasmin nāvindaṃs.
teṣāṃ yā eva gʰoratamās tanva āsaṃs, tā ekadʰā samabʰaraṃs.
tāḥ sambʰr̥tā eṣa devo 'bʰavat, tad asyaitad bʰūtavan nāma

Prajāpati his went over to his own daughter. Some say she was Dyau others Uṣā. Becoming a stag henwent to the red being. The gods saw it (crying), "Prajapati commits an act never done (before)." (In order to avert the evil consequences of this incestuous act) the gods inquired for some one who might destroy the evil consequences (of it). Among themselves they did not find any one who might do that (atone for Prajapati's crime). They then put the most fearful bodies (for the gods have many bodies) of theirs in one. This aggregate of the most fearful bodies of the gods became a god, Bhutavan, by name. 

bʰavati vai sa yo 'syaitad evaṃ nāma veda

For he who knows this name only, is born.

taṃ devā abrūvann:
ayaṃ vai Prajāpatir akr̥tam akar, imaṃ vidʰyeti.
sa tatʰety abravīt, sa vai vo varaṃ vr̥ṇā iti. vr̥ṇīṣveti.
sa etam eva varam avr̥ṇīta: paśūnām ādʰipatyaṃ.
tad asyaitat paśuman nāma

The gods said to him, "Prajapati has committed an act which he ought not to have committed. Pierce this (the incarnation of his evil deed)." So he did. He then said, "I will choose a boon from you." — They said, "Choose." He then chose as his boon sovereignty over cattle (32). That is the reason that his name is pasuman), i.e., having cattle. 

paśumān bʰavati yo 'syaitad evaṃ nāma veda

He who knows on this earth only this name (pasuman), becomes rich in cattle.

tam abʰyāyatyāvidʰyat, sa viddʰa ūrdʰva ՚0 udapravata,
tam etam Mr̥ga ity ācakṣate.
ya u eva mr̥gavyādʰaḥ sa u eva sa, yā rohit sā Rohiṇī,
yo eveṣus trikāṇḍā so eveṣus trikāṇḍā

tad vā idam Prajāpate retaḥ siktam adʰāvat, tat saro 'bʰavat.
te devā abruvan: medam Prajāpate reto duṣad iti.
yad abruvan: medam Prajāpate reto duṣad iti, tan māduṣam abʰavat,
tan māduṣasya māduṣatvam.
māduṣaṃ ha vai nāmaitad yan mānuṣaṃ,
tan māduṣaṃ san mānuṣam ity ācakṣate parokṣeṇa,
parokṣapriyā iva hi devāḥ
