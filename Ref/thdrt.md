Αλκμαίων τῆς μὲν ὑγιείας εἶναι συνεκτικὴν τὴν ἰσονομίαν τῶν δυνάμεων, ὑγροῦ, ξηροῦ, ψυχροῦ, θερμοῦ, πικροῦ, γλυκέος καὶ τῶν λοιπῶν, τὴν δ᾿ ἐν αὐτοῖς μοναρχίαν νόσου ποιητικήν· φθοροποιὸν γὰρ ἑκατέρου μοναρχίαν. Καὶ νόσον συμπίπτειν ὡς μὲν ὑφ᾿ οὗ ὑπερβολῆι θερμότητος ἢ ψυχρότητος, ὡς δὲ ἐξ οὗ διὰ πλῆθος τροφῆς ἢ ἔνδειαν, ὡς δ᾿ ἐν οἷς ἢ αἷμα ἢ μυελὸν ἢ ἐγκέφαλον. Ἐγγίνεσθαι δὲ τούτοις ποτὲ κἀκ τῶν ἔξωθεν αἰτιῶν, ὑδάτων ποιῶν (?) ἢ χώρας ἢ κόπων ἢ ἀνάγκης ἢ τῶν τούτοις παραπλησίων. Τὴν δὲ ὑγείαν τὴν σύμμετρον τῶν ποιῶν κρᾶσιν. Vgl.  Hipp. d. prisc. med. 14. I, 16, 2 Kühlew. Plato Symp. 186 CD.

Alkmaion of health is coherently the balance of the forces, wet, dry, cold, hot, bitter, sweet and the rest, the poetic monarchy in them, because it is a corrupting monarchy. And disease occurs as from excess of heat or cold, as from where there is too much food, as from where there is blood or marrow or brain. But these things sometimes become evil from external causes, whose waters (?) or country or labor or necessity or these neighbors. And the health of the symmetry of who they hold. Vgl.  Hip. d. prisc. med. 14. I, 16, 2 Kühlew. Plato Symp. 186 CDs.
