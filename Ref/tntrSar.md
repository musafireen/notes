"Abhinavagupta describes the process of the projection of pure consciousness into apparent manifestation as objects of knowledge and its contraction back into itself. The expansion ( vikāsa) of the cosmos in manifestation is the contraction ( saṃkoca) of consciousness, while conversely the contraction of manifestation becomes the expansion of consciousness (TS 29–30; see also Silburn 1975, 134–190, 193– 194)" (.)
