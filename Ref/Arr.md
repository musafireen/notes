 Δαρεῖος δὲ τέως μὲν ξὺν τῇ στρατιᾷ διέτριβεν, [p. 64] ἐπιλεξάμενος τῆς Ἀσσυρίας γῆς πεδίον πάντῃ ἀναπεπταμένον καὶ τῷ τε πλήθει τῆς στρατιᾶς ἐπιτήδειον καὶ ἐνιππάσασθαι τῇ ἵππῳ ξύμφορον. 
 
 Darius, on the other hand, had been spending a long time with his army, having chosen a plain in the land of Assyria which stretches out in every direction, suitable for the immense size of his army and convenient for the evolutions of cavalry. 
 
 καὶ τοῦτο τὸ χωρίον ξυνεβούλευεν αὐτῷ μὴ ἀπολείπειν Ἀμύντας ὁ Ἀντιόχου, ὁ παρὰ Ἀλεξάνδρου αὐτόμολος: εἶναι γὰρ τὴν εὐρυχωρίαν πρὸς τοῦ πλήθους τε καὶ τῆς σκευῆς τῶν Περσῶν. καὶ ἔμενε Δαρεῖος.

Amyntas, son of Antiochus, the deserter from Alexander, advised him not to abandon this position, because there was plenty of room for the great multitude of the Persians and for the vast quantity of their baggage. So Darius remained.

ὡς δὲ ἀλεξάνδρῳ πολλὴ μὲν [ἡ] ἐν Ταρσῷ τριβὴ ἐπὶ τῇ νόσῳ ἐγίνετο, οὐκ ὀλίγη δὲ ἐν Σόλοις, ἵνα ἔθυέ τε καὶ ἐπόμπευε, καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς ὀρεινοὺς Κίλικας διέτριψεν ἐξελάσας, τοῦτο ἔσφηλεν Δαρεῖον τῆς γνώμης: 

But as Alexander made a long stay at Tarsus on account of his illness, and not a short one at Soli, where he offered sacrifice and conducted his army in procession, and moreover spent some time in marching against the Cilician mountaineers, Darius was induced to swerve from his resolution. 

καὶ αὐτός τε, ὅ τί περ ἥδιστον ἦν δοξασθέν, ἐς τοῦτο οὐκ ἀκουσίως ὑπήχθη καὶ ὑπὸ τῶν καθ᾽ ἡδονὴν ξυνόντων τε καὶ ξυνεσομένων ἐπὶ κακῷ τοῖς ἀεὶ βασιλεύουσιν ἐπαιρόμενος ἔγνω μηκέτι Ἀλέξανδρον ἐθέλειν προϊέναι τοῦ πρόσω, ἀλλ᾽ ὀκνεῖν γὰρ πυνθανόμενον ὅτι αὐτὸς προσάγοι:

He was also not unwilling to be led to form whatever decision was most agreeable to his own wishes; and being influenced by those who gave him the advice which they thought would be pleasant to him, without consideration of its utility (for kings will always have associates to give them bad advice),237 he came to the conclusion that Alexander was no longer desirous of advancing further, but was shrinking from an encounter on learning that Darius himself was marching against him.

καὶ πίπτουσι μὲν αὐτῶν ἐς χιλίους καὶ εἷς τῶν ἡγεμόνων, Σατράκης, ἑάλωσαν δὲ ἐς ἑκατὸν καὶ πεντήκοντα. ὡς δὲ ἡ δίωξις ὀξεῖά τε καὶ διὰ καύματος πολλοῦ ταλαιπώρως ἐγίνετο, δίψει τε ἡ στρατιὰ πᾶσα εἴχετο καὶ αὐτὸς Ἀλέξανδρος ἐλαύνων πίνει ὁποῖον ἦν ὕδωρ ἐν τῇ γῇ ἐκείνῃ.

1,000 of them fell, including Satraces, one of their chiefs; and 150 were captured. But as the pursuit was keen and fatiguing on account of the excessive heat, the entire army was seized with thirst; and Alexander himself while riding drank of such water as was procurable in that country.

ἄρξαι δὲ τοῦ λόγου Ἀνάξαρχον, ὡς πολὺ δικαιότερον ἂν θεὸν νομιζόμενον Ἀλέξανδρον Διονύσου τε καὶ Ἡρακλέους, μὴ ὅτι τῶν ἔργων ἕνεκα ὅσα καὶ ἡλίκα καταπέπρακται [p. 165] Ἀλεξάνδρῳ, ἀλλὰ καὶ ὅτι Διόνυσος μὲν Θηβαῖος ἦν, οὐδέν τι προσήκων Μακεδόσι, καὶ Ἡρακλῆς Ἀργεῖος, οὐδὲ οὗτος προσήκων ὅτι μὴ κατὰ γένος τὸ Ἀλεξάνδρου: Ἡρακλείδην γὰρ εἶναι Ἀλέξανδρον: 

Anaxarchus commenced the discussion[554](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/46976/46976-h/46976-h.htm#Footnote_554) by saying that he considered Alexander much more worthy of being deemed a god than either Dionysus or Heracles, not only on account of the very numerous and mighty exploits 225which he had performed, but also because Dionysus was only a Theban, in no way related to Macedonians; and Heracles was an Argive, not at all related to them, except that Alexander deduced his descent from him. 

[7] Μακεδόνας δὲ ἂν τὸν σφῶν βασιλέα δικαιότερον θείαις τιμαῖς κοσμοῦντας. καὶ γὰρ οὐδὲ ἐκεῖνο εἶναι ἀμφίλογον ὅτι ἀπελθόντα γε ἐξ ἀνθρώπων ὡς θεὸν τιμήσουσι: 

He added that the Macedonians might with greater justice gratify their king with divine honours, for there was no doubt about this, that when he departed from men they would honour him as a god. 

πόσῳ δὴ δικαιότερον ζῶντα γεραίρειν ἤπερ τελευτήσαντα ἐς οὐδὲν ὄφελος τῷ τιμωμένῳ. 

How much more just then would it be to worship him while alive, than after his death, when it would be no advantage to him to be honoured.

λεχθέντων δὲ τούτων τε καὶ τοιούτων λόγων

When Anaxarchus had uttered these remarks and others of a similar kind, 
### c11

πρὸς Ἀναξάρχου τοὺς μὲν μετεσχηκότας τῆς βουλῆς ἐπαινεῖν τὸν λόγον καὶ δὴ ἐθέλειν ἄρχεσθαι τῆς προσκυνήσεως, τοὺς Μακεδόνας δὲ τοὺς πολλοὺς ἀχθομένους τῷ λόγῳ σιγῇ ἔχειν. 

those who were privy to the plan applauded his speech, and wished at once to begin the ceremony of prostration. Most of the Macedonians, however, were vexed[555](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/46976/46976-h/46976-h.htm#Footnote_555) at the speech and kept silence.
#### 2
Καλλισθένην δὲ ὑπολαβόντα, Ἀλέξανδρον μὲν, εἰπεῖν, ὦ Ἀνάξαρχε, οὐδεμιᾶς ἀνάξιον ἀποφαίνω τιμῆς ὅσαι ξύμμετροι ἀνθρώπῳ: ἀλλὰ διακεκρίσθαι γὰρ τοῖς ἀνθρώποις ὅσαι τε ἀνθρώπιναι τιμαὶ καὶ ὅσαι θεῖαι πολλοῖς μὲν καὶ ἄλλοις, καθάπερ ναῶν τε οἰκοδομήσει καὶ ἀγαλμάτων ἀναστάσει καὶ τεμένη ὅτι τοῖς θεοῖς ἐξαιρεῖται καὶ θύεται ἐκείνοις καὶ σπένδεται, καὶ ὕμνοι μὲν ἐς τοὺς θεοὺς ποιοῦνται, ἔπαινοι δὲ ἐς ἀνθρώπους, — ἀτὰρ οὐχ ἥκιστα τῷ τῆς προσκυνήσεως νόμῳ. 

But Callisthenes interposed and said:—“O Anaxarchus, I openly declare that there is no honour which Alexander is unworthy to receive, provided that it is consistent with his being human; but men have made distinctions between those honours which are due to men, and those due to gods, in many different ways, as for instance by the building of temples and by the erection of statues. Moreover for the gods sacred enclosures are selected, to them sacrifice is offered, and to them libations are made. Hymns also are composed in honour of the gods, and eulogies for men. But the greatest distinction is made by the custom of prostration.
#### 3 
τοὺς μὲν γὰρ ἀνθρώπους φιλεῖσθαι πρὸς τῶν ἀσπαζομένων, τὸ θεῖον δέ, ὅτι ἄνω που ἱδρυμένον καὶ οὐδὲ ψαῦσαι αὐτοῦ θέμις, ἐπὶ τῷδε ἄρα τῇ προσκυνήσει γεραίρεται, καὶ χοροὶ τοῖς θεοῖς ἵστανται καὶ παιᾶνες ἐπὶ τοῖς θεοῖς ᾄδονται. καὶ οὐδὲν θαυμαστόν, ὁπότε γε καὶ αὐτῶν τῶν θεῶν ἄλλοις ἄλλαι τιμαὶ πρόσκεινται, καὶ ναὶ μὰ Δία ἥρωσιν ἄλλαι, καὶ αὗται ἀποκεκριμέναι τοῦ θείου. 

For it is the practice that men should be kissed by those who salute them556; but 226because the deity is located somewhere above, it is not lawful even to touch him, and this is the reason no doubt why he is honoured by prostration. Bands of choral dancers are also appointed for the gods, and paeans are sung in their honour. And this is not at all wonderful, seeing that certain honours are specially assigned to some of the gods and certain others to other gods, and, by Zeus, quite different ones again are assigned to heroes, which are very distinct from those paid to the deities.557
#### 4 
οὔκουν εἰκὸς ξύμπαντα ταῦτα ἀναταράσσοντας τοὺς μὲν ἀνθρώπους [p. 166] ἐς σχῆμα ὑπέρογκον καθιστάναι τῶν τιμῶν ταῖς ὑπερβολαῖς, τοὺς θεοὺς δὲ τό γε ἐπὶ σφίσιν ἐς ταπεινότητα οὐ πρέπουσαν καταβάλλειν τὰ ἴσα ἀνθρώποις τιμῶντας. 

It is not therefore reasonable to confound all these distinctions without discrimination, exalting men to a rank above their condition by extravagant accumulation of honours, and debasing the gods, as far as lies in human power, to an unseemly level, by paying them honours only equal to those paid to men.” 

οὔκουν οὐδὲ Ἀλέξανδρον ἀνασχέσθαι ἄν, εἰ τῶν ἰδιωτῶν τις εἰσποιοῖτο ταῖς βασιλικαῖς τιμαῖς χειροτονίᾳ ἢ ψήφῳ οὐ δικαίᾳ. 

He said that Alexander would not endure the affront, if some private individual were to be thrust into his royal honours by an unjust vote, either by show of hand or by ballot. 
#### 5
πολὺ ἂν οὖν δικαιότερον τοὺς θεοὺς δυσχεραίνειν ὅσοι ἄνθρωποι ἐς τὰς θείας τιμὰς σφᾶς εἰσποιοῦσιν ἢ πρὸς ἄλλων εἰσποιούμενοι ἀνἐχονται. 

Much more justly then would the gods be indignant at those mortals who usurp divine honours or suffer themselves to be thrust into them by others. 

Ἀλέξανδρον δὲ πόρρω τοῦ ἱκανοῦ ἀνδρῶν ἀγαθῶν τὸν ἄριστον εἶναί τε καὶ δοκεῖν, καὶ βασιλέων τὸν βασιλικώτατον καὶ στρατηγῶν τὸν ἀξιοστρατηγότατον. 

“Alexander not only seems to be, but is in reality beyond any competition the bravest of brave men, of kings the most kingly, and of generals the most worthy to command an army.
#### 6
καὶ σέ, εἴπερ τινὰ ἄλλον, ὦ Ἀνάξαρχε, εἰσηγητήν τε τούτων τῶν λόγων ἐχρῆν γίγνεσθαι καὶ κωλυτὴν τῶν ἐναντίων, ἐπὶ σοφίᾳ τε καὶ παιδεύσει Ἀλεξάνδρῳ ξυνόντα. 

O Anaxarchus, it was thy duty, rather than any other man’s, to become the special advocate of these arguments now adduced by me, and the opponent of those contrary to them, seeing that thou associatest with him for the purpose of imparting philosophy and instruction. 

οὔκουν ἄρχειν γε τοῦδε τοῦ λόγου πρέπον ἦν, ἀλλὰ μεμνῆσθαι γὰρ οὐ Καμβύσῃ οὐδὲ Ξέρξῃ ξυνόντα ἢ ξυμβουλεύοντα, ἀλλὰ Φιλίππου μὲν παιδί, Ἡρακλείδῃ δὲ ἀπὸ γένους καὶ Αἰακίδῃ, ὅτου οἱ πρόγονοι ἐξ Ἄργους ἐς Μακεδονίαν ἦλθον, οὐδὲ βίᾳ, ἀλλὰ νόμῳ Μακεδόνων ἄρχοντες διετέλεσαν.

Therefore it was unseemly to begin this discussion, when thou oughtest to have remembered that thou art not associating with and giving advice to Cambyses or Xerxes, but to the son of Philip, who derives his origin from Heracles and Aeacus,558 whose 227ancestors came into Macedonia from Argos, and have continued to rule the Macedonians, not by force, but by law. 
#### 7
οὔκουν οὐδὲ αὐτῷ τῷ Ἡρακλεῖ ζῶντι ἔτι θεῖαι τιμαὶ παρ᾽ Ἑλλήνων ἐγένοντο, ἀλλ᾽ οὐδὲ τελευτήσαντι πρόσθεν ἤ πρὸς τοῦ θεοῦ τοῦ ἐν Δελφοῖς ἐπιθεσπισθῆναι ὡς θεὸν τιμᾶν Ἡρακλέα.

Not even to Heracles himself while still alive were divine honours paid by the Greeks; and even after his death they were withheld until a decree had been published by the oracle of the god at Delphi that men should honour Heracles as a god. 

εἰ δέ, ὅτι ἐν τῇ βαρβάρῳ γῇ οἱ λόγοι γίγνονται, βαρβαρικὰ χρὴ ἔχειν τὰ φρονήματα, καὶ ἐγὼ τῆς Ἑλλάδος μεμνῆσθαί σε ἀξιῶ, ὦ Αλέξανδρε, ἧς ἕνεκα ὁ πᾶς στόλος σοι ἐγένετο, προσθεῖναι τὴν Ἀσίαν τῇ Ἑλλάδι. 

But if, because the discussion is held559 in the land of foreigners, we ought to adopt the sentiments of foreigners, I demand, O Alexander, that thou shouldst bethink thyself of Greece, for whose sake the whole of this expedition was undertaken by thee, that thou mightest join Asia to Greece.

τὰ σφέτερα πράγματα ἀμφὶ μέσας νύκτας τὴν πόλιν ἐκλείπουσιν, ἔφυγον δὲ ἐς τὴν πέτραν. ὣς δὲ καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι βάρβαροι ἔπραττον: ἀπολιπόντες τὰς πόλεις ξύμπαντες ἔφευγον ἐς τὴν πέτραν τὴν ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ τὴν Ἄορνον καλουμένην. μέγα γάρ τι τοῦτο χρῆμα πέτρας ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ ταύτῃ ἐστί, καὶ λόγος ὑπὲρ αὐτῆς κατέχει οὐδὲ Ἡρακλεῖ τῷ Διὸς ἁλωτὸν γενέσθαι τὴν πέτραν. 

When the men in Bazira heard this news, despairing of 258their own affairs, they abandoned the city about the middle of the night, and fled to the rock as the other barbarians were doing. For all the inhabitants deserted the cities and began to flee to the rock which is in their land, and is called Aornus.613 For stupendous is this rock in this land, about which the current report is, that it was found impregnable even by Heracles, the son of Zeus. 
#### 2
εἰ μὲν δὴ καὶ ἐς Ἰνδοὺς ἀφίκετο ὁ Ἡρακλῆς ὁ Θηβαῖος ἢ ὁ Τύριος ἢ ὁ Αἰγύπτιος ἐς οὐδέτερα ἔχω ἰσχυρίσασθαι: μᾶλλον δὲ δοκῶ ὅτι οὐκ ἀφίκετο, ἀλλὰ πάντα γὰρ ὅσα χαλεπὰ οἱ ἄνθρωποι ἐς τοσόνδε ἄρα αὔξουσιν αὐτῶν τὴν χαλεπότητα, ὡς καὶ τῷ Ἡρακλεῖ ἂν ἄπορα γενέσθαι μυθεύειν. 

I cannot affirm with confidence either way, whether the Theban, Tyrian, or Egyptian Heracles614 penetrated into India or not; but I am rather inclined to think that he did not penetrate so far; for men are wont to magnify the difficulty of difficult enterprises to such a degree as to assert that they would have been impracticable even to Heracles. 

κἀγὼ ὑπὲρ τῆς πέτρας ταύτης οὕτω γιγνώσκω, τὸν Ἡρακλέα ἐς κόμπον τοῦ λόγου ἐπιφημίζεσθαι. 

Therefore, I am inclined to think, that in regard to this rock the name of Heracles was mentioned simply to add to the marvellousness of the tale.

#### 3
τὸν μὲν δὴ κύκλον τῆς πέτρας λέγουσιν ἐς διακοσίους σταδίους μάλιστα εἶναι, ὕψος δὲ αὐτῆς, ἵναπερ χθαμαλώτατον, σταδίων ἕνδεκα, καὶ ἀνάβασιν χειροποίητον μίαν χαλεπήν: 

The circuit of the rock is said to be about 200 stades (_i.e._ about twenty-three miles), and its height where it is lowest, eleven stades (_i.e._, about a mile and a quarter). There was only one ascent, which was artificial and difficult; 

εἶναι δὲ καὶ ὕδωρ ἐν ἄκρᾳ τῇ πέτρᾳ πολὺ καὶ καθαρόν, πηγὴν ἀνίσχουσαν, ὡς καὶ ἀπορρεῖν ἀπὸ τῆς πηγῆς ὕδωρ, καὶ ὕλην καὶ γῆν ἀγαθὴν ἐργάσιμον [p. 194] ὅσην καὶ χιλίοις ἀνθρώποις ἀποχρῶσαν ἂν εἶναι ἐργάζεσθαι. 

on the summit of the rock there was abundance of pure water, a spring issuing from the ground, from which the water flowed; and there was also timber, and sufficient good arable land for 1,000 men to till.
#### 4
καὶ ταῦτα ἀκούοντα Ἀλέξανδρον πόθος λαμβάνει ἐξελεῖν καὶ τοῦτο τὸ ὄρος, οὐχ ἥκιστα ἐπὶ τῷ ἀμφὶ τὸν Ἡρακλέα μύθῳ πεφημισμένῳ. 

When Alexander heard this, he was seized with a vehement desire to capture this mountain also, especially on account of the legend which was current 259about Heracles. 

τὰ μὲν δὴ Ὦρα καὶ τὰ Μάσσαγα φρούρια ἐποίησεν ἐπὶ τῇ χώρᾳ, τὰ Βάζιρα δὲ τὴν πόλιν ἐξετείχισε. 

He then made Ora and Massaga fortresses to keep the land in subjection, and fortified the city of Bazira.

τῇ μὲν δὴ πρώτῃ ἡμέρᾳ ὡς ἐπὶ στάδιον ἔχωσεν αὐτῷ ὁ στρατός. ἐς δὲ τὴν ὑστεραίαν οἵ τε σφενδονῆται σφενδονῶντες ἐς τοὺς Ἰνδοὺς ἐκ τοῦ ἤδη κεχωσμένου καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν μηχανῶν βέλη ἀφιέμενα ἀνέστελλε τῶν Ἰνδῶν τὰς ἐκδρομὰς τὰς ἐπὶ τοὺς χωννύοντας. καὶ ἐχώννυτο αὐτῷ ἐς τρεῖς ἡμέρας ξυνεχῶς τὸ χωρίον. τῇ τετάρτῃ δὲ βιασάμενοι τῶν Μακεδόνων οὐ πολλοὶ κατέσχον ὀλίγον γήλοφον ἰσόπεδον τῇ πέτρᾳ. καὶ Ἀλέξανδρος οὐδέν τι ἐλινύων ἐπῆγε τὸ χῶμα ξυνάψαι ἐθέλων τὸ χωννύμενον τῷ γηλόφῳ, ὅντινα οἱ ὀλίγοι αὐτῷ ἤδη κατεῖχον. 

On the first day his army constructed the mound the length of a stade; and on the following day the slingers shooting at the Indians from the part already finished, assisted by the missiles which were hurled from the military engines, repulsed the sallies which they made against the men who were constructing the mound. He went on with the work for three days without intermission, and on the fourth day a few of the Macedonians forcing their way occupied a small eminence which was on a level with the rock. Without taking any rest, Alexander went on with the mound, being desirous of connecting his artificial rampart with the eminence which the few men were now occupying for him.
#### 2
οἱ δὲ Ἰνδοὶ πρός τε τὴν ἀδιήγητον τόλμαν τῶν ἐς τὸν γήλοφον βιασαμένων Μακεδόνων ἐκπλαγέντες καὶ τὸ χῶμα ξυνάπτον ἤδη ὁρῶντες, τοῦ μὲν ἀπομάχεσθαι ἔτι ἀπείχοντο, πέμψαντες δὲ κήρυκας σφῶν παρὰ Ἀλέξανδρον ἐθέλειν ἔφασκον ἐνδοῦναι τὴν πέτραν, εἴ σφισι σπένδοιτο. γνώμην δὲ ἐπεποίηντο ἐν τῷ ἔτι διαμέλλοντι τῶν σπονδῶν διαγαγόντες τὴν ἡμέραν νυκτὸς ὡς ἕκαστοι διασκεδάννυσθαι ἐπὶ τὰ σφέτερα ἤθη.  

But then the Indians, being alarmed at the indescribable audacity of the Macedonians, who had forced their way to the eminence, and seeing that the mound was already united with it, desisted from attempting any longer to resist. They sent their herald to Alexander, saying that they were willing to surrender the rock, if he would grant them a truce. But they had formed the design of wasting the day by continually delaying the ratification of the truce, and of scattering themselves in the night with the view of escaping one by one to their own abodes.
#### 3
καὶ τοῦτο ὡς ἐπύθετο Ἀλέξανδρος, ἐνδίδωσιν αὐτοῖς χρόνον τε ἐς τὴν ἀποχώρησιν καὶ τῆς φυλακῆς τὴν κύκλωσιν τὴν πάντῃ ἀφελεῖν. καὶ αὐτὸς ἔμενεν ἔστε ἤρξαντο τῆς ἀποχωρήσεως: καὶ ἐν τούτῳ ἀναλαβὼν τῶν σωματοφυλάκων καὶ τῶν ὑπασπιστῶν ἐς ἑπτακοσίους κατὰ τὸ ἐκλελειμμένον τῆς πέτρας ἀνέρχεται ἐς αὐτὴν πρῶτος, καὶ οἱ Μακεδόνες ἄλλος ἄλλῃ ἀνιμῶντες ἀλλήλους ἀνῄεσαν.  

When Alexander discovered this plan of theirs, he allowed them time to commence their retreat, and to remove the guard which was placed all round the place. He remained quiet until they began their retreat; then taking 700 of the body-guards and shield-bearing infantry, he was the first to scale the rock at the part of it abandoned by the enemy; and the Macedonians ascended after him, one in one place another in another, drawing each other up.
#### 4
καὶ οὗτοι ἐπὶ τοὺς ἀποχωροῦντας τῶν βαρβάρων τραπόμενοι ἀπὸ ξυνθήματος, πολλοὺς μὲν αὐτῶν ἐν τῇ φυγῇ ἀπέκτειναν, οἱ δὲ καὶ πεφοβημένως ἀποχωροῦντες κατὰ τῶν κρημνῶν ῥίψαντες σφᾶς ἀπέθανον. εἴχετό τε Ἀλεξάνδρῳ ἡ [p. 198] πέτρα ἡ τῷ Ἡρακλεῖ ἄπορος γενομένη καὶ ἔθυεν ἐπ᾽ αὐτῇ Ἀλέξανδρος καὶ κατεσκεύασε φρούριον, παραδοὺς Σισικόττῳ ἐπιμελεῖσθαι τῆς φρουρᾶς, ὃς ἐξ Ἰνδῶν μὲν πάλαι ηὐτομολήκει ἐς Βάκτρα παρὰ Βῆσσον, Ἀλεξάνδρου δὲ κατασχόντος τὴν χώραν τὴν Βακτρίαν ξυνεστράτευέ τε αὐτῷ καὶ πιστὸς ἐς τὰ μάλιστα ἐφαίνετο.  

These men at the concerted signal turned themselves upon the retreating barbarians, and killed many of them in their flight.263 Others retreating with panic terror perished by leaping down the precipices; and thus the rock which had been inexpugnable to Heracles was occupied by Alexander. He offered sacrifice upon it, and arranged a fort, committing the superintendence of the garrison to Sisicottus, who long before had deserted from the Indians to Bessus in Bactra, and after Alexander had acquired possession of the country of Bactra, entered his army and appeared to be eminently trustworthy.

He now set out from the rock and invaded the land of the Assacenians; for he was informed that the brother of Assacenus, with his elephants and many of the neighbouring barbarians had fled into the mountains in this district. 

καὶ ἀφικόμενος ἐς Δύρτα πόλιν τῶν μὲν ἐνοικούντων οὐδένα καταλαμβάνει οὐδὲ ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ τῇ πρὸς τῇ πόλει: ἐς δὲ τὴν ὑστεραίαν Νέαρχόν τε καὶ Ἀντίοχον τοὺς χιλιάρχους τῶν ὑπασπιστῶν ἐκπέμπει:  

When he arrived at the city of Dyrta,618 he found none of the inhabitants either in it or in the land adjacent. On the following day he sent out Nearchus and Antiochus, the colonels of the shield-bearing guards, 
#### 6
καὶ Νεάρχῳ μὲν τοὺς Ἀγριᾶνας τοὺς ψιλοὺς ἄγειν ἔδωκεν, Ἀντιόχῳ δὲ τήν τε αὑτοῦ χιλιαρχίαν καὶ δύο ἐπὶ ταύτῃ ἄλλας. 

giving the former the command of the Agrianians and the light-armed troops,619 and the latter the command of his own regiments and two others besides. 

ἐστέλλοντο δὲ τά τε χωρία κατοψόμενοι καὶ εἴ πού τινας τῶν βαρβάρων ξυλλαβεῖν ἐς ἔλεγχον τῶν κατὰ τὴν χώραν, τῶν τε ἄλλων καὶ μάλιστα δὴ τὰ ἀμφὶ τοὺς ἐλέφαντας ἔμελεν αὐτῷ μαθεῖν.  

They were despatched both to reconnoitre the locality and to try if they could capture some of the barbarians anywhere in order to get information about the general affairs of the country; and he was especially anxious to learn news of the elephants. 
#### 7
αὐτὸς δὲ ὡς ἐπὶ τὸν Ἰνδὸν ποταμὸν ἤδη ἦγε, καὶ ἡ στρατιὰ αὐτῷ ὡδοποίει τὸ πρόσω ἰοῦσα ἄπορα ἄλλως ὄντα τὰ ταύτῃ χωρία. 

He now directed his march towards the river Indus,620 the army going in advance to make 264a road for him, as otherwise this district would have been impassable. 

ἐνταῦθα ξυλλαμβάνει ὀλίγους τῶν βαρβάρων, καὶ παρὰ τούτων ἔμαθεν, ὅτι οἱ μὲν ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ Ἰνδοὶ παρὰ Ἀβισάρῃ ἀποπεφευγότες εἶεν, τοὺς δὲ ἐλέφαντας ὅτι αὐτοῦ κατέλιπον νέμεσθαι πρὸς τῷ ποταμῷ τῷ Ἰνδῷ: 

Here he captured a few of the barbarians, from whom he learnt that the Indians of that land had fled for safety to Abisares, but that they had left their elephants there to pasture near the river Indus. 

καὶ τούτους ἡγήσασθαί οἱ τὴν ὁδὸν ἐκέλευσεν ὡς ἐπὶ τοὺς ἐλέφαντας.  

He ordered these men to show him the way to the elephants. 
#### 8
εἰσὶ δὲ Ἰνδῶν πολλοὶ κυνηγέται τῶν ἐλεφάντων, καὶ τούτους σπουδῇ ἀμφ᾽ αὑτὸν εἶχεν Ἀλέξανδρος, καὶ τότε ἐθήρα  [p. 199] ξὺν τούτοις τοὺς ἐλέφαντας: 

Many of the Indians are elephant-hunters, and these Alexander kept in attendance upon him in high honour, going out to hunt the elephants in company with them. 

καὶ δύο μὲν αὐτῶν ἀπόλλυνται κατὰ κρημνοῦ σφᾶς ῥίψαντες ἐν τῇ διώξει, οἱ δὲ ἄλλοι ξυλληφθέντες ἔφερόν τε τοὺς ἀμβάτας καὶ τῇ στρατιᾷ ξυνετάσσοντο.  

Two of these animals perished in the chase, by leaping down a precipice, but the rest were caught and being ridden by drivers were marshalled with the army. 
#### 9
ἐπεὶ δὲ καὶ ὕλῃ ἐργασίμῳ ἐνέτυχε παρὰ τὸν ποταμὸν, καὶ αὕτη ἐκόπη αὐτῷ ὑπὸ τῆς στρατιᾶς καὶ ναῦς ἐποιήθησαν. καὶ αὗται κατὰ τὸν Ἰνδὸν ποταμὸν ἤγοντο ὡς ἐπὶ τὴν γέφυραν, ἥντινα Ἡφαιστίων καὶ Περδίκκας αὐτῷ ἐξῳκοδομηκότες πάλαι ἦσαν.

He also as he was marching along the river lighted upon a wood the timber of which was suitable for building ships; this was cut down by the army, and ships were built for him, which were brought down the river Indus to the bridge, which had long since been constructed by Hephaestion and Perdiccas at his command.

ὡς δὲ ἐπέβη τῇ Νύσῃ Ἀλέξανδρος, ἐκπέμπουσι παρ᾽ αὐτὸν οἱ Νυσαῖοι τὸν κρατιστεύοντα σφῶν, ὄνομα δὲ ἦν αὐτῷ Ἄκουφις, καὶ ξὺν αὐτῷ πρέσβεις τῶν δοκιμωτάτων τριάκοντα, δεησομένους Ἀλεξάνδρου ἀφεῖναι τῷ θεῷ τὴν πόλιν.

When Alexander arrived at Nysa, the Nysaeans sent for him the governor of Sphinx, whose name was Akouphis, and at once ambassadors of the tried thirty, devoted to Alexander, left the city to God.

let the ambassadors pass by Alexander's tent, and they will see him sitting and standing on the side of the road, away from the weapons and the others, and the helmet [on him] also [p. 201] the one who had the spear: you were dazzled seeing the sight and falling to the ground on a very slow occasion. But when Alexander resurrects them and dares to elect them, then do not call Acouphinus Arxamenos here.

ὦ βασιλεῦ, δέονταί σου Νυσαῖοι ἐᾶσαι σφᾶς ἐλευθέρους τε καὶ αὐτονόμους αἰδοῖ τοῦ Διονύσου. Διόνυσος γὰρ ἐπειδὴ χειρωσάμενος τὸ Ἰνδῶν ἔθνος ἐπὶ θάλασσαν ὀπίσω κατῄει τὴν Ἑλληνικήν, ἐκ τῶν ἀπομάχων στρατιωτῶν, οἳ δὴ αὐτῷ καὶ βάκχοι ἦσαν, κτίζει τὴν πόλιν τήνδε μνημόσυνον τῆς αὑτοῦ πλάνης τε καὶ νίκης τοῖς ἔπειτα ἐσόμενον, καθάπερ οὖν καὶ σὺ αὐτὸς Ἀλεξάνδρειάν τε ἔκτισας τὴν πρὸς Καυκάσῳ ὄρει καὶ ἄλλην Ἀλεξάνδρειαν ἐν τῇ Αἰγυπτίων γῇ, καὶ ἄλλας πολλὰς τὰς μὲν ἔκτικας ἤδη, τὰς δὲ καὶ κτίσεις ἀνὰ χρόνον, οἷα δὴ πλείονα Διονύσου ἔργα ἀποδειξάμενος.

O king, the people of Nysa owe you, you are the free and autonomous sons of Dionysus. For Dionysus, because the Indian nation had been driven back to the sea by the Greeks, from among the valiant soldiers, who were also Bacchians, built the city in commemoration of his error and victory for those who entered, and he himself also was an Alexandrian you built it Towards the Caucasus he sees another Alexandria in the land of Egypt, and many others which he has already built, and which he has built over time, which are not more works of Dionysus than can be proved.

Νῦσάν τε οὖν ἐκάλεσε τὴν πόλιν Διόνυσος ἐπὶ τῆς τροφοῦ τῆς Νύσης καὶ τὴν χώραν Νυσαίαν: τὸ δὲ ὄρος ὅ τι περ πλησίον ἐστὶ τῆς πόλεως καὶ τοῦτο Μηρὸν ἐπωνόμασε Διόνυσος, ὅτι δὴ κατὰ τὸν μῦθον ἐν μηρῷ τῷ τοῦ Διὸς ηὐξήθη. καὶ ἐκ τούτου ἐλευθέραν τε οἰκοῦμεν τὴν Νῦσαν καὶ αὐτοὶ αὐτόνομοι καὶ ἐν κόσμῳ πολιτεύοντες: τῆς δὲ ἐκ Διονύσου οἰκίσεως καὶ τόδε σοι γενέσθω τεκμήριον: κιττὸς γὰρ οὐκ ἄλλῃ τῆς Ἰνδῶν γῆς φυόμενος παρ᾽ ἡμῖν φύεται. καὶ ταῦτα πάντα Ἀλεξάνδρῳ πρὸς θυμοῦ ἐγίγνετο

Nysan, therefore, called the city Dionysos after the feeding of Nysis and the country Nysaian: and the mountain that is near the city and this Miron he named Dionysos, because according to the myth he rose in the thigh of Zeus. And for this reason they freed the house of Nysa, and they were independent and governed in the world: but of the house of Dionysus, and then I will give you a presumption: for nothing else in the land of India grows near us. And all this was done to Alexander's anger

And on this account I commend some of the Indian philosophers, who are said to have been caught by Alexander as they were walking in the open meadow where they were accustomed to spend their time.830 

ἄλλο μὲν οὐδὲν ποιῆσαι πρὸς τὴν ὄψιν αὐτοῦ τε καὶ τῆς στρατιᾶς, κρούειν δὲ τοῖς ποσὶ τὴν γῆν ἐφ᾽ ἧς βεβηκότες ἦσαν. 

At the sight of him and his army they did nothing else but stamp with their feet on the earth, upon which they were stepping. 

ὡς δὲ ἤρετο Ἀλέξανδρος δι᾽ ἑρμηνέων ὅ τι νοοῖ αὐτοῖς τὸ ἔργον, τοὺς δὲ ὑποκρίνασθαι ὧδε:

When he asked them by means of interpreters what was the meaning of their action, they replied as follows: 
#### 6
βασιλεῦ Ἀλέξανδρε, ἄνθρωπος μὲν ἕκαστος τοσόνδε τῆς γῆς κατέχει ὅσονπερ τοῦτό ἐστιν ἐφ᾽ ὅτῳ βεβήκαμεν: σὺ δὲ ἄνθρωπος ὢν παραπλήσιος τοῖς ἄλλοις, πλήν γε δὴ ὅτι πολυπράγμων καὶ ἀτάσθαλος, ἀπὸ τῆς οἰκείας τοσαύτην γῆν ἐπεξέρχῃ πράγματα ἔχων τε καὶ παρέχων ἄλλοις. καὶ οὖν καὶ ὀλίγον ὕστερον ἀποθανὼν τοσοῦτον καθέξεις τῆς γῆς ὅσον ἐξαρκεῖ ἐντεθάφθαι τῷ σώματι.

“O king Alexander, every man possesses as much of the earth as this upon which we have stepped; but thou being only a man like the rest of us, except in being meddlesome and arrogant, art come over so great a part of the earth from thy own 371land, giving trouble both to thyself and others.831 And yet thou also wilt soon die, and possess only as much of the earth as is sufficient for thy body to be buried in.”

κἀνταῦθα ἐπῄνεσε μὲν Ἀλέξανδρος τούς τε λόγους αὐτοὺς καὶ τοὺς εἰπόντας, ἔπρασσε δὲ ὅμως ἄλλα καὶ τἀναντία οἷς ἐπῄνεσεν. 

On this occasion Alexander commended both the words and the men who spoke them; but nevertheless he did just the opposite to that which he commended. 

ἐπεὶ καὶ Διογένην τὸν ἐκ Σινώπης θαυμάσαι λέγεται, ἐν Ἰσθμῷ ἐντυχὼν τῷ Διογένει κατακειμένῳ ἐν ἡλίῳ, ἐπιστὰς σὺν τοῖς ὑπασπισταῖς καὶ τοῖς πεζεταίροις καὶ ἐρόμενος εἴ του δέοιτο: 

When also in the Isthmus he met Diogenes of Sinope, lying in the sun, standing near him with his shield-bearing guards and foot Companions, he asked if he wanted anything. 

ὁ δέ Διογένης ἄλλου μὲν ἔφη δεῖσθαι οὐδενός, ἀπὸ τοῦ ἡλίου δὲ ἀπελθεῖν ἐκέλευσεν αὐτόν τε καὶ τοὺς σὺν αὐτῷ. 

But Diogenes said that he wanted nothing else, except that he and his attendants would stand out of the sunlight. 

οὕτω τοι οὐ πάντῃ ἔξω τοῦ ἐπινοεῖν τὰ κρείττω ἦν Ἀλέξανδρος, ἀλλ᾽ ἐκ δόξης γὰρ δεινῶς ἐκρατεῖτο.

Alexander is said to have expressed his admiration of Diogenes’s conduct. Thus it is evident that Alexander was not entirely destitute of better feelings; but be was the slave of his insatiable ambition.

Again, when he arrived at Taxila and saw the naked sect of Indian philosophers, he was exceedingly desirous that one of these men should live with him; because he admired their power of endurance.833

καὶ ὁ μὲν πρεσβύτατος τῶν σοφιστῶν, ὅτου ὁμιληταὶ οἱ ἄλλοι ἦσαν, Δάνδαμις ὄνομα, οὔτε αὐτὸς ἔφη παρ᾽ Ἀλέξανδρον ἥξειν οὔτε τοὺς ἄλλους εἴα,

But the oldest of the philosophers, Dandamis by name, of whom the others were disciples, refused to come himself to Alexander, and would not allow the others to do so.

ἐν δὲ τῷ ἀνάπλῳ τοὺς καταρράκτας τοὺς κατὰ τὸν ποταμὸν ἀφανίζων ὁμαλὸν πάντῃ ἐποίει τὸν ῥοῦν, οἳ δὴ ἐκ Περσῶν πεποιημένοι ἦσαν τοῦ μή τινα ἀπὸ θαλάσσης ἀναπλεῦσαι εἰς τὴν χώραν αὐτῶν νηΐτῃ στόλῳ κρατήσαντα. 

In his voyage up he destroyed the weirs which existed in the river, and thus made the stream quite level. These weirs had been constructed by the Persians, to prevent any enemy having a superior naval force from sailing up from the sea into their country. 

ταῦτα δὲ μεμηχάνητο ἅτε δὴ οὐ ναυτικοῖς τοῖς Πέρσαις· οὕτω δὴ συνεχεῖς οἱ καταρράκται πεποιημένοι ἄπορον τὸν ἀνάπλουν ἐποίουν τὸν κατὰ τὸν Τίγρητα. 

The Persians had had recourse to these contrivances because they were not a nautical people; and thus by making an unbroken succession of weirs they had rendered the voyage up the Tigres a matter of impossibility. 

Ἀλέξανδρος δὲ οὐκ ἔφη τῶν κρατούντων τοῖς ὅπλοις εἶναι τὰ τοιαῦτα σοφίσματα· οὔκουν πρὸς αὑτοῦ ἐποιεῖτο ταύτην τὴν ἀσφάλειαν, ἥντινα ἔργῳ οὐδὲ λόγου ἀξίαν ἀπέφηνε οὐ χαλεπῶς διακόψας τῶν Περσῶν τὰ σπουδάσματα.

But Alexander said that such devices were unbecoming to men who are victorious in battle; and therefore he considered this means of safety unsuitable for him; and by easily demolishing the laborious work of the Persians, he proved in fact that what they thought a protection was unworthy of the name.

As for Dionysus, the city of Nysa is no mean memorial of his expedition, and also Mount Merus, and the growth of ivy on this mountain; then the habit of the Indians themselves setting out to battle with the sound of drums and cymbals; and their dappled costume, like that worn by the bacchanals of Dionysus. But of Heracles the memorials are slight.

Among the Sibae, too, an Indian tribe, having noticed them clad with skins they used to assert that they were relics of Heracles’ expedition. What is more, as the Sibae carried a club, and they brand their cattle with a club, they referred this too to some memory of Heracles’ club.

These wise men spend their time naked, during the winter in the open air and sunshine, but in summer, when the sun is strong, in the meadows and the marsh lands under great trees; (The banyan.) their shade Nearchus computes to reach five plethra all round, and ten thousand men could take shade under one tree; so great are these trees.
