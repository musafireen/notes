10 iam comitiorum adpetebat tempus, cum a P. Licinio consule litterae Romam allatae, se exercitumque suum gravi morbo adflictari, nec sisti potuisse, [p. 498] ni eadem vis mali aut gravior etiam in hostes ingruisset; 

The time of the elections was now drawing near, when a letter from the consul Publius Licinius arrived at Rome, stating that “he himself and his army were afflicted with a severe sickness, nor could they have stood their ground had not the malady attacked the enemy with the same or even greater violence.

[2] itaque, quoniam ipse venire ad comitia non posset, si ita patribus videretur, se Q. Caecilium Metellum dictatorem comitiorum causa dicturum; exercitum Q. Caecili dimitti e re publica esse; 

[2] Therefore, as he could not come himself to the election, he would, with the approbation of the senate, nominate Quintus Caecilius Metellus dictator, for the purpose of holding the election.

[3] nam neque usum eius ullum in praesentia esse, cum Hannibal iam in hiberna suos receperit, et tanta incesserit in ea castra vis morbi, ut, nisi mature dimittantur, nemo omnium superfuturus videatur. ea consuli a patribus facienda, ut e re publica fideque sua duceret, permissa.

[3] That it was for the interest of the state that the army of Quintus Caecilius should be disbanded; for that it could not be made any use of under present circumstances, for Hannibal had now withdrawn his troops into [p. 1245]winter quarters; and so violent was the malady which had infected that camp, that unless it was speedily broken up, there would not survive one man out of the whole army.” The senate left it to the consul to settle these matters, as he should deem consistent with the interest of the state and his own honour.

[4] civitatem eo tempore repens religio invaserat invento carmine in libris Sibyllinis propter crebrius eo anno de caelo lapidatum inspectis, 

[4] The state was at this time suddenly occupied with a question of a religious nature, in consequence of the discovery of a prediction in the Sibylline books, which had been inspected on account of there having been so many showers of stones this year.

[5] quandoque hostis alienigena terrae Italiae bellum intulisset, eum pelli Italia vincique posse, si mater Idaea a Pessinunte Romam advecta foret. 

[5] It ran thus: “Whensoever a foreign enemy should bring war into the land of Italy, he may be driven out of Italy and conquered, if the Idaean Mother should be brought from Pessinus to Rome.”

[6] id carmen ab decemviris inventum eo magis patres movit, quod et legati, qui donum Delphos portaverant, referebant et sacrificantibus ipsis Pythio Apollini laeta exta fuisse et responsum oraculo editum, maiorem multo victoriam, quam cuius ex spoliis dona portarent, adesse populo Romano. 

[6] This prophecy, discovered by the decemviri, produced the greater impression upon the senate, because ambassadors also, who had carried a present to Delphi, had brought word back, that they had both obtained a favourable appearance in sacrificing to the Pythian Apollo, and that a response was delivered from the oracle, to the effect, that a much greater victory than that from the spoils of which they now brought presents, awaited the Roman people.

[7] in eiusdem spei summam conferebant P. Scipionis velut praesagientem animum de fine belli, quod depoposcisset provinciam Africam. 

[7] They considered the presentiment which existed in the mind of Publius Scipio, with regard to the termination of the war, when he claimed Africa as his province, as corroborating the same anticipation. 
##### 8
[8] itaque, quo maturius fatis, ominibus oraculisque portendentis sese victoriae compotes fierent, id cogitare atque agitare, quae ratio transportandae Romam deae esset.

[8] In order, therefore, that they might the more speedily put themselves in possession of victory, which was portended to them by the fates, omens, and oracles, they began to think what method could be adopted for conveying the goddess to Rome.

nullasdum in Asia socias civitates habebat populus Romanus; tamen memores Aesculapium quoque ex Graecia quondam hauddum ullo foedere sociata valetudinis populi causa arcessitum, 

As yet the Roman people had none of the states of Asia in alliance with them. Recollecting, however, that formerly Aesculapius, on account of a sickness among the people, was fetched from Greece, which was not then united with them by any treaty;

[2] tunc iam cum Attalo rege propter commune adversus Philippum bellum coeptam amicitiam esse, facturum eum, quae posset, populi Romani causa, legatos ad eum decernunt,

[3??] account of the war which they waged in common against Philip, and that he would do whatever he could to oblige the Roman people, they resolved to send, as ambassadors to him, Marcus Valerius Laevinus, who had been twice consul, and had carried on operations in Greece; Marcus Caecilius Metellus, who had been praetor; Servius Sulpicius Galba, who had been aedile; and two who had been quaestors, Caius Tremellius [p. 1246]Flaccus and Marcus Valerius Falto.

[4] iis quinque naves quinqueremes, ut ex dignitate populi Romani adirent eas terras, ad quas concilianda maiestas nomini Romano esset, decernunt. 

[4] To these five quinqueremes were assigned, in order that, in a manner suitable to the dignity of the Roman people, they might visit those lands where it was important to gain respect for the Roman name.

[5] legati Asiam petentes protinus Delphos cum escendissent, oraculum adierunt consulentes, ad quod negotium domo missi essent, perficiendi eius quam sibi spem populoque Romano portenderet. 

[5] The ambassadors, on their way to Asia, having landed at Delphi, immediately approached the oracle, inquiring what hopes the deity held out to themselves and the Roman people, of accomplishing the business for which they had been sent from home.

[6] responsum esse ferunt per Attalum regem compotes eius fore, quod peterent; cum Romam deam devexissent, tum curarent, ut ear, qui vir optimus Romae esset, hospitio acciperet. 

[6] It is said that the answer given was, “that they would obtain what they were seeking by means of king Attalus. When they had conveyed the goddess to Rome, they must take care that the best man at Rome should receive her to his hospitality.”

[7] Pergamum ad regem venerunt. is legatos comiter acceptos Pessinuntem in Phrygiam deduxit sacrumque iis lapidem, quam matrem deum esse incolae dicebant, tradidit ac deportare Romam iussit. 

[7] They came to Pergamus to the king, who received the ambassadors graciously, and conducted them to Pessinus in Phrygia, and putting into their hands a sacred [8??] stone,

[9] Q. Caecilius Metellus dictator ab consule in Bruttiis comitiorum causa dictus, exercitusque eius dimissus, magister equitum L. Veturius Philo. 

[9] Marcus Valerius Falto, who was sent in advance, brought word that the goddess was on her way, and that the most virtuous man in the state must be sought out, who might in due form receive and entertain her. Quintus Caecilius Metellus was nominated dictator for holding the elections, by the consul in Bruttium, and his army was disbanded.

[10] comitia habita per dictatorem. consules facti M. Cornelius Cethegus, P. Sempronius Tuditanus absens, cum provinciam Graeciam haberet. 

[10] Lucius Veturius Philo was made master of the horse.

[11] The elections were held by the dictator; the consuls elected were Marcus Cornelius Cethegus and Publius Sempronius Tuditanus, who was absent, being engaged in his province of Greece. The praetors were then elected: Titus Claudius Nero, Marcus Marcius Ralla, Lucius Scribonius Libo, Marcus Pomponius Matho. 
##### 12
[12] curules erant aediles Cn. et L. Cornelii Lentuli; Lucius Hispaniam provinciam habebat; absens creatus absens eum honorem gessit. 

[12] On the conclusion of the elections, the dictator abdicated his office. The Roman games were repeated thrice, the plebeian seven times.

[13] Ti. Claudius Asellus et M. Iunius Pennus plebei aediles fuerunt. aedem Virtutis eo anno ad portam Capenam M. Marcellus dedicavit septumo decumo anno, postquam a patre eius primo consulatu vota in Gallia ad Clastidium fuerat. 

[13] The curule aediles were Cneius and Lucius Cornelius Lentulus: Lucius had the province of Spain; he was elected in his absence, and was absent while he filled the office. The plebeian aediles were Titus Claudius Asellus and Marcus Junius Pennus. Marcus Marcellus this year dedicated the temple of Virtue at the Porta Capena, in the seventeenth year after it had been vowed by his father during his first consulate at Clastidium in Gaul:
