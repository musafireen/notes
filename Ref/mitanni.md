Treaty between Suppiluliuma I of Hatti
and Shattiwaza of Mittanni
n istOTicui I mroaucnon
§1 (A obv. 1-16) When My Majesty, Suppiluliuma, Great King, Hero, King
of Hatti, Beloved of the Storm-god, and Artatama, king of the land of Hurri,
made a treaty with one another, at that time Tushratta, king of the land of
Mittanni, called for attention from the Great King, King of Hatti, Hero. And
I, Great King, Hero, King of Hatti, turned my attention to Tushratta, king of
the land of Mittanni: I plundered the lands of the west bank of the River
(Euphrates), and I annexed Mount Lebanon, A second time King Tushratta 

the west bank of the Euphrates?" - thus King Tushratta - "If you plunder
the lands of the west bank of the Euphrates, then I too will plunder the
lands of the west bank of the Euphrates." King Tushratta desired to bring it
under contro1(?); "If you plunder them, what will I do to them? If a lamb, or if
a kid of my land i s . . . , I will cross over from the east bank of the Euphrates."
I, Great King, King of Hatti, maintained my pride before him. In the time of
the father of the King of Hatti, the land of Isuwa became hostile, so that the
troops of Hatti entered the land of Isuwa. In the time of my father, the
troops of the city of Kurtalissa, the troops of the city of Arawanna, the land
Kama, the troops of the city of Turmitta, the land of Alha, the land of
Hurma, Mount Harana, half of the land of Tegarama, the troops of the city
of Tepurziya, the troops of the city of Hazka, and the troops of the city of
Armatana became hostile. But My Majesty, Suppiluliuma, Great King, Hero,
King of Hatti, Beloved of the Storm-god, defeated them. Now the troops
which had escaped from me had entered the land of Isuwa, and all these
troops and these lands which had become hostile in the time of my father
were dwelling beyond the land of Isuwa among the enemy.
§2 (A obv. 17-24) And I, My Majesty, Suppiluliuma, Great King, King of Hatti» Hero, Beloved of the Storm-god, set out against the presumptuousness
of King Tushratta. I crossed the Euphrates and went to the land of
Isuwa For the second time I overpowered the land of Isuwa and for the second
time I made them my subjects. The troops and lands which in the time
of my father entered the land of Isuwa: the troops of the city of Kurtalissa,
the troops of the city of Ar a wanna, the land of Zazisa, the land of
Kalasma(l), the land of Timana, Mount Haliwa, Mount Kama, the troops of
the city of Turmitta, the land of Alha, the land of Hurma, Mount Harana,
half of the land of Tegarama, the troops of the city of Tepurziya. the troops
of the city of Hazka, and the troops of the city of Armatana — these troops
and those lands I overpowered and returned to Hatti. I freed the lands
which I captured; they dwelt in their places. All the people whom I released
rejoined their peoples, and Hatti incorporated their territories.
§3 (A obv. 25-29) And I, My Majesty, Suppiluliuma, Great King, King of
Hatti, Hero, Beloved of the Storm-god, reached the land of Alshi and the
district of Kutmar, and I overpowered them. I gave it as a gift to Antaratli of
the land of Alshi I penetrated to the district of Shuta and plundered the district
of Shuta. I reached the city of Washshukkanni in search of plunder. I
brought to Hatti the cattle, sheep, and horses of the district of Shuta, along
with its possessions and its civilian captives. But King Tushratta fled. He
did not come against me for battle.
§4 (A obv. 30-37) I crossed the Euphrates again and overpowered the land
of Aleppo and the land of Mukish. Takuwa, king of Niya, came before me
for peace terms in the land of Mukish. But behind the back of Takuwa, his
brother Aki-Teshshup, brought(!) the land of Niya, and the city of Niya to
hostility. And this Aki-Teshshup united the chariot warriors. Heshmiya,
Asiri, Zulkiya, Habahi, Birriya, and Niruwabi, along with their chariotry and
their infantry, made common cause with Akiya, king of Arahati. They
seized the city of Arahati and began war, thinking: "<Let> us fight with the
Great King, King of Hatti." I, Great King, King of Hatti, overpowered the
city of Arahati. I captured Akiya, king of Arahati; Aki-Teshshup, brother of
Takuwa; and all of their chariot warriors, together with their possessions,
and brought them to Hatti I also brought the city of Qatna, together with
its belongings and possessions, to Hatti.
§5 (A obv. 38-47) When I went to the land of Nuhashshi, I captured all of
its territory. (Its king) Sharrupshi alone escaped, but I captured his mother,
his brothers, and his children, and I brought them to Hatti. I installed Takipsharri,
subject of Sharrupshi, in kingship over the city of Ukulzat. I went to
the land of Apina, but I did not seek to attack the land of Kinza. But (its
king) Shutatarra, together with his son Aitaqqama and his chariotry. came against me for battle. I drove him oil, and they entered the city of Abzuya. I
invested Abzuya, and I captured Shutatarra, together with his children, his
chariot warriors, his brothers, and [his possessions], and I brought them to
Hatti. I went to the land of Apina, and Ariwana, king of the land of Apina,
and his noblemen Wambadura, Akparu, and Artaya, came against me for
battle. I brought all of these, together with their land and their possessions,
to Hatti. Because of the presumptuousness of King Tushratta, I plundered
all of these lands in one year and brought them to Hatti. From Mount
Lebanon and from the far bank of the Euphrates I made them my territory.
§6 (A obv. 48-58) When his son conspired with his subjects, he killed his
father, King Tushratta And with the death of King Tushratta the Storm-god
decided the legal case of Artatama. His son brought the dead Artatama7
back to life. The entire land of Mittanni went to ruin, and the land of Assyria
and the land of Alshi divided it between them. Until now I, Great King,
Hero, King of Hatti, have not crossed to the east bank, and have not taken
even a blade of straw or a splinter of wood of the land of Mittanni. When I,
Great King, King of Hatti, heard about the poverty of the land of Mittanni, I,
King of Hatti, had the palace officials bring them cattle, sheep, and horses.
But there was confusion among the Hurrians, and Shutatarra,8 together
with the chariot warriors, sought to kill Prince Shattiwaza. However, he
escaped and came into the presence of My Majesty, Suppiluliuma, King of
Hatti, Hero, Beloved of the Storm-god. I, Great King, spoke thus: "The
Storm-god has decided his legal case. As I have taken up Shattiwaza, son of
King Tushratta, in my hand, I will seat him upon the throne of his father, so
that the land of Mittanni, the great land, does not go to ruin. I, Great King,
King of Hatti, have given life to the land of Mittanni for the sake of my(()
daughter. I took up Shattiwaza, son of Tushratta, in my hand, and I gave him
a daughter in marriage."

§1 (obv. 1-7) [Thus says] Shattiwaza, son of Tushratta, king of [the land]
of Mittanni: Before Shuttarna, son of Artatama, [King of Hurri], altered the
[ . . . ] of the land of Mittanni, King Artatama, his father, did wrong. He used
up the palace of the kings, together with its treasures. He exhausted them in
payment to the land of Assyria and to the land of Alshi. King Tushratta, my
father, built a palace and filled it with riches, but Shuttarna destroyed it, and
it became impoverished. And he broke the [ . . . ] of the kings, of silver and
gold, and the caldrons of silver from the bath house. And [from the
wealth(?)] of his father and his brother he did not give anyone (in Mittanni)
anything, but he threw himself down before the Assyrian, the subject of his
father, who no longer pays tribute, and gave him his riches as a gift.
§2 (obv. 8-20) Thus says Shattiwaza, son of King Tushratta- The door of silver and gold which King Saushtatar, my {great-)great-grandfather, took by
force from the land of Assyria as a token of his glory and set up in his
palace in the city of Washshukkanni — to his shame Shuttarna has now
returned it to the land of Assyria. All the utensils of the storehouse of
gifts(?) of silver and gold he gave to the land of Alshi. He exhausted the
house of the king of the land of Mittanni, together with its treasures and its
riches. He filled it with dirt. He destroyed the palace and exhausted the
households of the Hurrians. He had the noblemen brought and extradited
to the land of Assyria and the land of Alshi. They were turned over and
impaled in the city of Taite. Thus he brought an end to the Hurrians. But
Aki-Teshshup fled before him and entered Babylonia. Two hundred chariots
fled with him, and the King of Babylonia took away for himself the two
hundred chariots and all the possessions of Aki-Teshshup. He made Aki-
Teshshup assume the same rank as his chariot warriors. He conspired (?) to
kill him. He would have killed me, Shattiwaza, son of King Tushratta, too,
but I escaped from his hands and called upon the gods of His Majesty, Suppiluliuma,
Great King, King of Hatti, Hero, Beloved of the Storm-god. They
led me on a road without [ . . . ] The gods of the King of Hatti and the gods
of the king of Mittanni caused me to reach His Majesty, Suppiluliuma, Great
King, King of Hatti, Hero. Beloved of the Storm-god.
§3 (obv. 21-30) At the Marassantiya (hallys) River I fell at the feet of His Majesty,
Suppiluliuma, Great King, King of Hatti, Hero, Beloved of the Storm-god.
[The Great King] took me by the hand and rejoiced over me and questioned
me at length concerning all the customs of the land of Mittanni. [And
when] he had heard exhaustively [about the customs] of the land of Mittanni,
the Great King and Hero spoke as follows: "If I conquer Shuttarna and
[the troops of] the land of Mittanni, I will not reject you but will adopt you
as my son. I will stand by you and place you on the throne of your father.
And the gods know My Majesty, Suppiluliuma, Great King, King of Hatti,
Hero, Beloved of the Storm-god. He never goes back on the words which
issue from his mouth." Thus says Shattiwaza, son of Tushratta: I rejoiced at
the words of the King, my lord, which I heard. I, Prince Shattiwaza, spoke to
the Great King, my lord: "If you, my lord, will give me life, and the gods will
stand by me, then the Great King, King of Hatti, Hero, Beloved of the
Storm-god, shall certainly not remove king Artatama from his royal throne.
Let me stand as his designated successor, and let me rule the land of Mittanni.
Shuttarna treated the lands badly, but I will never do anything for ill."
§4 (obv. 31-40) And when I, Prince Shattiwaza, came before the Great
King, I had only three chariots, two Hurrians, two other attendants, who set
out with me(l), and a single outfit of clothes — which I was wearing — and nothing else. And the Great King took pity on me and gave me chariots
mounted with gold, chariot horses with armor, [ . . . ] , a tent ol linen, servants
of the , . . -house, two vessels of [silver] and gold, together with their
cups of silver and gold, silver utensils of the bath house, a silver wash basin,
festive garments of the wool-worker - all this and everything <of> the
craftsman, He . . . me to Piyassili, [his son], and the King entrusted me to the
hand of Piyassili, to his chariotry, [and] to his troops. From the city of Carchemish
where we arrived, we sent a messenger to the people of the city of
Irrite, but Shuttarna had influenced the Hurrians with the riches of Tushratta
and had united them. We sent to them in Irrite, and these Hurrians
sent back to Piyassili: "Why are you coming? If you are coming for battle,
come, but you shall not return to the land of the Great King!" When we had
heard the words of the people of Irrite, we — Prince Piyassili and Prince
Shattiwaza — crossed the Euphrates and arrived at Irrite ready for battle.
§5 (obv. 41-47) And the gods of the Great King, King of Hatti, protected
us, and the Hurrians whom Shuttarna had sent as protection to Irrite, as
well as the chariotry and troops of the district of Irrite, gathered in wait for
us. We reached Irrite, and the troops and chariotry which had sat within the
city came out before us. We captured and destroyed all the . . . [which . . . ]
When the people of Irrite... them [ . . . ] they assembled. In Irrite and all the
districts of Irrite they came before us for peace. [ . . . ] The people of the city
of Harran and [the districts] of Harran assembled and came to us. [ . . . in]
Harran we will establish them.
§6 (Akkadian obv. 48-65; Hittite lines l'-20') [The Assyrian . . . ] sent
him/it to besiege [Washshukkanni] and gave them a single chariot warrior
as leader. [But] when he [came] to the city [of Washshukkanni, the people
of] Washshukkanni refused to make peace. But when the infantry and chariotry
[of Assyria] besieged Washshukkanni, Prince Piyassili and I, Prince
Shattiwaza, [were] in Irrite. A messenger came to us from Washshukkanni
[and] spoke [as follows]: "The infantry and chariotry of Assyria are coming
for battle [against the infantry and chariotry] of Hatti." [Then(?) . . . ] we
marched out, [and] their(?) [ . . . ] came to meet [us], saying: " [ . . . And] in the
[presence] of the scribe [of] the gate of the city of [ . . . ] And the infantry
and chariotry of Assyria [ . . . " . . . ] he took away. But when to us [ . . . ], we
went up [to Washshukkanni. But] the city of Pakarripa [ . . . ] turned. And
when [the people of Pakarripa] heard that [Prince] Piyassili and [Prince]
Shattiwaza, and both the infantry and the chariotry of Hatti were going up
to Washshukkanni,
§6 {continued) (Hittite lines 21-29') the people of Pakarripa deserted and
became allies [of Hatti]. And we [went] out from Washshukkanni and went to Pakarripa Word was brought to us: The Assyrian is coming against you
in battle." The environs of Pakarripa were desolate, and hunger caught up
with the troops. The Assyrians, however, were not to be seen again. They
did not come against us in battle, and we went after the Assyrians to the
city of NilapshinL But the Assyrians did not come against us in battle there
either.
§7 (Akkadian rev 1-6; Hittite lines 30-38') [This section, where the final
defeat of Shuttarna by the army of Piyassili and Shattiwaza is seemingly narrated,
is too fragmentary for translation.]
