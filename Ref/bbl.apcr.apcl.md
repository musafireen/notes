Κατ ἐκεῖνον τὸν καιρὸν ἦμεν πάντες οἱ ἀπόστολοι ἐν Ἰεροσολύμοις, Σίμων ὁ λεγόμενος Πέτρος καὶ Ἀνδρέας ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ, Ἰάκωβος ὁ τοῦ Ζεβεδαίου καὶ Ἰωάννης ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ, Φίλιππος καὶ Βαρθολομαῖος, Θωμᾶς καὶ Ματθαῖος ὁ τελώνης, Ἰάκωβος Ἁλφαίου καὶ Σίμων ὁ Καναναῖος,
καὶ Ἰούδας Ἰακώβου, καὶ διείλαμεν τὰ κλίματα τῆς οἰκουμένης, ὅπως εἷς ἕκαστος ἡμῶν ἐν τῷ κλίματι τῷ λαχόντι αὐτῷ καὶ εἰς τὸ ἔθνος ἐν ᾧ ὁ κύριος αὐτὸν ἀπέστειλεν πο ρευθῇ. κατὰ κλῆρον οὖν ἔλαχεν ἡ Ἰνδία Ἰούδᾳ Θωμᾷ τῷ καὶ Διδύμῳ· οὐκ ἐβούλετο δὲ ἀπελθεῖν, λέγων μὴ δύνασθαι μήτε χωρεῖν διὰ τὴν ἀσθένειαν τῆς σαρκός, καὶ ὅτι Ἄνθρωπος ὢν Ἑβραῖος πῶς δύναμαι πορευθῆναι ἐν τοῖς Ἰνδοῖς κηρύξαι τὴν ἀλήθειαν; Καὶ ταῦτα αὐτοῦ διαλογιζομένου καὶ λέγοντος ὤφθη αὐτῷ ὁ σωτὴρ διὰ τῆς νυκτός, καὶ λέγει αὐτῷ· Μὴ φοβοῦ Θωμᾶ, ἄπελθε εἰς τὴν Ἰνδίαν καὶ κήρυξον ἐκεῖ τὸν λόγον· ἡ γὰρ χάρις μού ἐστιν μετὰ σοῦ. Ὃ δὲ οὐκ ἐπείθετο,
λέγων· Ὅπου βούλει με ἀποστεῖλαι ἀπόστειλον ἀλλαχοῦ· εἰς Ἰνδοὺς γὰρ οὐκ ἀπέρχομαι.


The First Act, when he went into India with Abbanes the merchant.

At that season all we the apostles were at Jerusalem, Simon which is called Peter and Andrew his brother, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew the publican, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Canaanite, and Judas the brother of James: and we divided the regions of the world, that every one of us should go unto the region that fell to him and unto the nation whereunto the Lord sent him.

According to the lot, therefore, India fell unto Judas Thomas, which is also the twin: but he would not go, saying that by reason of the weakness of the flesh he could not travel, and I am an Hebrew man; how can I go amongst the Indians and preach the truth? And as he thus reasoned and spake, the Saviour appeared unto him by night and saith to him: Fear not, Thomas, go thou unto India and preach the word there, for my grace is with thee. But he would not obey, saying: Whither thou wouldest send me, send me, but elsewhere, for unto the Indians I will not go.

Καὶ ταῦτα αὐτοῦ λέγοντος καὶ ἐνθυμουμένου ἔτυχεν ἔμπορόν τινα εἶναι ἐκεῖ ἀπὸ τῆς Ἰνδίας ἐλθόντα ᾧ ὄνομα Ἀββάνης, ἀπὸ τοῦ βασιλέως Γουνδαφόρου ἀποσταλέντα καὶ ἐντολὴν παρ αὐτοῦ εἰληφότα τέκτονα πριάμενον ἀγαγεῖν αὐτῷ. ὁ δὲ κύριος ἰδὼν αὐτὸν ἐν τῇ ἀγορᾷ περιπατοῦντα τὸ μεσημβρινὸν εἶπεν αὐτῷ· Βούλει τέκτονα πρίασθαι; Ὃ δὲ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· Ναι. Καὶ ὁ κύριος ἔφη αὐτῷ· Ἔχω δοῦλον τέκτονα καὶ βούλομαι αὐτὸν πωλῆσαι. Καὶ ταῦτα εἰπὼν ὑπέδειξεν αὐτῷ τὸν Θωμᾶν ἀπὸ μακρόθεν, καὶ συνεφώνησεν

μεταὐτοῦ τριῶν λιτρῶν ἀσήμου, καὶ ἔγραψεν ὠνὴν λέγων· Ἐγὼ Ἰησοῦς υἱὸς Ἰωσήφ τοῦ τέκτονος ὁμολογῶ πεπρακέναι ἐμὸν δοῦλον Ἰούδαν ὀνόματι σοὶ τῷ Ἀββάνῃ ἐμπόρῳ Γουνδαφόρου τοῦ βασιλέως τῶν Ἰνδῶν. Τῆς δὲ ὠνῆς τελεσθείσης ὁ σωτὴρ παραλαβὼν Ἰούδαν τὸν καὶ Θωμᾶν ἀπήγαγεν πρὸς Ἀββάνην τὸν ἔμπορον· καὶ ἰδὼν αὐτὸν ὁ Ἀββάνης εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτόν· Οὖτός ἐστιν ὁ δεσπότης σου; Καὶ ἀποκριθεὶς ὁ ἀπόστολος εἶπεν· Ναί, κύριός μού ἐστιν. Ὃ δέ φησιν· Ἠγόρασά σε παρ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ὁ ἀπόστολος ἡσύχαζεν.

And while he thus spake and thought, it chanced that there was there a certain merchant come from India whose name was Abbanes, sent from the King Gundaphorus,1 [*]and having commandment from him to buy a carpenter and bring him unto him.

Now the Lord seeing him walking in the market-place at noon said unto him: Wouldest thou buy a carpenter? And he said to him: Yea. And the Lord said to him: I have a slave that is a carpenter and I desire to sell him. And so saying he showed him Thomas afar off, and agreed with him for three litrae of silver unstamped, and wrote a deed of sale, saying: I, Jesus, the son of Joseph the carpenter, acknowledge that I have sold my slave, Judas by name, unto thee Abbanes, a merchant of Gundaphorus, king of the Indians. And when the deed was finished, the Saviour took Judas Thomas and led him away to Abbanes the merchant; and when Abbanes saw him he said unto him: Is this thy master? And the apostle said: Yea, he is my Lord. And he said: I have bought thee of him. And the apostle held his peace.
### 3
Τῇ δὲ ἑξῆς ὄρθρου εὐξάμενος καὶ δεηθεὶς τοῦ κυρίου εἶπεν ὁ ἀπόστολος· Πορεύομαι ὅπου βούλει κύριε Ἰησοῦ· τὸ

θέληματὸ σὸν γενέσθω. Ἀπῆλθεν δὲ πρὸς Ἀββάνην τὸν ἔμπορον μηδὲν ὅλως τι μεθ ἑαυτοῦ κομισάμενος ἀλλ ἢ τὸ τίμημα αὐτοῦ μόνον. δεδώκει γὰρ αὐτῷ ὁ κύριος λέγων· Ἥτω μετὰ σοῦ καὶ ἡ τιμή σου μετὰ τῆς χάριτός μου ὅπου ἂν ἀπέρχῃ. Κατέλαβεν δὲ ὁ ἀπόστολος τὸν Ἀββάνην ἴσως τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ ἀναφέροντα εἰς τὸ πλοῖον· ἤρξατο οὖν καὶ αὐτὸς συναναφέρειν αὐτῷ. ἐμβάντων δὲ αὐτῶν εἰς τὸ πλοῖον καὶ καθεσθέντων ἐξήταζεν ὁ Ἀββάνης τὸν ἀπόστολον λέγων· Ποίαν ἐργασίαν οἶδας; Ὃ δὲ ἔφη· Ἐν μὲν ξύλοις ἄροτρα καὶ ζυγοὺς καὶ τρυτάνας καὶ πλοῖα καὶ κώπας πλοίων καὶ ἱστοὺς καὶ τροχίσκους, ἐν δὲ λίθοις στήλας τε καὶ ναοὺς καὶ πραιτώρια
βασιλικά. Εἶπεν δὲ αὐτῷ ὁ Ἁββάνης ὁ ἔμπορος· Τοιούτου γὰρ καὶ χρείαν ἔχομεν τεχνίτου. Ἤρξαντο οὖν καταπλέειν· ἔσχον δὲ ἐπιτήδειον ἄνεμον, καὶ προθύμως ἔπλεον ἕως ὅτε κατήντησαν εἰς Ἀνδράπολιν, πόλιν βασιλικήν.

And on the day following the apostle arose early, and having prayed and besought the Lord he said: I will go whither thou wilt, Lord Jesus; thy will be done. And he departed unto Abbanes the merchant, taking with him nothing at all save only his price. For the Lord had given it unto him, saying: Let

thy price also be with thee, together with my grace, wheresoever thou goest.
And the apostle found Abbanes carrying his baggage on board the ship; so he also began to carry it aboard with him. And when they were embarked in the ship and were set down, Abbanes questioned the apostle, saying: What craftsmanship knowest thou? And he said: In wood I can make ploughs and yokes and augers [*], and boats and oars for boats and masts and pulleys; and in stone, pillars and temples and court-houses for kings. And Abbanes the merchant said to him: Yea, it is of such a workman that we have need. They began then to sail homeward; and they had a favourable wind, and sailed prosperously till they reached Andrapolis, a royal city.
### 4
Ἐξελθόντες δὲ ἀπὸ τοῦ πλοίου εἰσῄεσαν εἰς τὴν πόλιν. καὶ ἰδοὺ φωναὶ αὐλητῶν καὶ ὑδραύλεων καὶ σάλπιγγες περιηχοῦσαι αὐτούς· ἐξήταζεν δὲ ὁ ἀπόστολος λέγων· Τίς ἐστιν αὕτη ἡ ἑορτὴ ἡ ἐν τῇ πόλει ταύτῃ; Ἔλεγον δὲ αὐτῷ οἱ ἐκεῖ

ὅτιΚαὶ σὲ οἱ θεοὶ ἤγαγον ἵνα εὐωχηθῇς ἐν τῇ πόλει ταύτῃ. ὁ γὰρ βασιλεὺς θυγατέρα μονογενῆ ἔχει, καὶ νῦν αὐτὴν ἐκδίδωσιν ἀνδρὶ πρὸς γάμον· τῶν οὖν γάμων ἡ χαρὰ καὶ ἡ πανήγυρίς ἐστιν αὕτη σήμερον ἣν εἶδες ἑορτήν. ὁ δὲ βασιλεὺς κήρυκας ἀπέστειλεν κηρύξαι πανταχοῦ πάντας παρατυχεῖν εἰς τοὺς γάμους, πλουσίους τε καὶ πένητας, δούλους τε καὶ ἐλευθέρους, ξένους τε καὶ πολίτας· εἴ τις δὲ παραιτήσηται καὶ μὴ παρατύχῃ εἰς τοὺς γάμους, ὑπεύθυνος ἔσται τῷ βασιλεῖ. Ἀββάνης δὲ ἀκούσας εἶπεν τῷ ἀποστόλῳ· Ἀπέλθωμεν οὖν καὶ ἡμεῖς, ἵνα μὴ προσκρούσωμεν τῷ βασιλεῖ, καὶ μάλιστα ξένοι ὄντες. Ὃ δὲ εἶπεν· Ἀπέλθωμεν. Καταλύσαντες δὲ ἐν τῷ ξενοδοχείῳ καὶ ὀλίγον ἀναπαέντες ἀπῆλθον εἰς τοὺς γάμους.
καὶἰδὼν ὁ ἀπόστολος ἀνακεκλιμένους πάντας ἀνεκλίθη καὶ αὐτὸς ἐν τῷ μέσῳ· ἀπέβλεπον δὲ εἰς αὐτὸν πάντες ὡς εἰς ξένον καὶ ἐξ ἀλλοδαπῆς ἐλθόντα γῆς· Ἀββάνης δὲ ὁ ἔμπορος ὡς ἅτε δεσπότης εἰς ἄλλον τόπον ἀνεκλίθη.

And they left the ship and entered into the city, and lo, there were noises of flutes and water-organs, and trumpets sounded about them; and the apostle inquired, saying: What is this festival that is in this city? And they that were there said to him: Thee also have the gods brought to make merry in this city. For the king hath an only daughter, and now he giveth her in marriage unto an husband: this rejoicing, therefore, and assembly of the wedding to-day is the festival which thou hast seen. And the king hath sent heralds to proclaim everywhere that all should come to the marriage, rich and poor, bond and free, strangers and citizens: and if any refuse and come not to the marriage he shall answer for it unto the king. And Abbanes hearing that, said to the apostle: Let us also go, lest we offend the king, especially seeing we are strangers. And he said: Let us go.

And after they had put up in the inn and rested a little space they went to the marriage; and the apostle seeing them all set down (reclining), laid himself, he also, in the midst, and all looked upon him, as upon a stranger and one come from a foreign land: but Abbanes the merchant, being his master, laid himself in another place.
### 11
Ὁ δὲ βασιλεὺς ἠξίου τοὺς παρανύμφους ἐξέρχεσθαι ἀπὸ τοῦ νυμφῶνος. πάντων δὲ ἐξελθόντων καὶ τῶν θυρῶν κλεισθεισῶν ὁ νυμφίος τὸ καταπέτασμα τοῦ νυμφῶνος ἐπῆρεν,

ἵνα τὴν νύμφην πρὸς ἑαυτὸν ἀγάγῃ. καὶ εἶδεν τὸν κύριον Ἰησοῦν τὴν ἀπεικασίαν Ἰούδα Θωμᾶ ἔχοντα καὶ ὁμιλοῦντα τῇ νύμφῃ, τοῦ πρὸ βραχέως εὐλογήσαντος αὐτοὺς καὶ ἐξελθόντος ἀπ αὐτῶν, τοῦ ἀποστόλου, καί φησιν αὐτῷ· Ὀυχὶ πρὸ πάντων ἐξῆλθες; πῶς νῦν εὑρέθης ὧδε; Ὁ δὲ κύριος εἶπεν αὐτῷ· Ἐγὼ οὐκ εἰμὶ Ἰούδας ὁ καὶ Θωμᾶς, ἀδελφὸς δὲ αὐτοῦ εἰμι. Καὶ ἐκαθέσθη ὁ κύριος ἐπὶ τῆς κλίνης, ἐκέλευσεν δὲ καὶ αὐτοῖς καθεσθῆναι ἐπὶ τοῖς δίφροις, καὶ ἤρξατο αὐτοῖς λέγειν·

And the king desired the groomsmen to depart out of the bride-chamber; and when all were gone out and the doors were shut, the bridegroom lifted up the curtain of the bride-chamber to fetch the bride unto him. And he saw the Lord Jesus bearing the likeness of Judas Thomas and speaking with the bride— even of him that but now had blessed them and gone out from them, the apostle; and he saith unto him: Wentest thou not out in the sight of all? how then art thou found here? But the Lord said to him: I am not Judas which is also called Thomas, but I am his brother. And the Lord sat down upon the bed and bade them also sit upon chairs, and began to say unto them:
### 16
Ἀκούσας δὲ ὁ βασιλεὺς παρὰ τοῦ νυμφίου καὶ τῆς νύμφης ταῦτα, τὴν ἐσθῆτα αὐτοῦ διέρρηξεν καὶ τοῖς παρεστῶσιν αὐτῷ ἐγγὺς αὐτοῦ ἔλεγεν· Ἐξέλθατε ταχέως καὶ περιέλθατε ὅλην τὴν πόλιν, καὶ συλλαβόντες φέρετέ μοι ἐκεῖνον τὸν ἄνδρα τὸν φαρμακὸν τὸν κακῶς παρατυχόντα ἐν τῇ πόλει ταύτῃ· ἐγὼ γὰρ εἰσήγαγον αὐτὸν ἰδίαις χερσὶν εἰς τὸν οἶκόν μου, καὶ ἐγὼ εἶπον αὐτῷ ἵνα εὔξηται ἐπὶ τῇ ἀτυχεστάτῃ μου θυγατρί· ὃς δ ἂν εὑρὼν αὐτὸν προσαγάγῃ μοι, πᾶν εἴ τι ἂν

αἰτήσηταίμοι, δίδωμι αὐτῷ. Ἀπελθόντες οὖν περιῆλθον ζητοῦντες αὐτόν, καὶ οὐχ εὗρον αὐτόν· πλεύσας γὰρ ἦν. ἀπῆλθον δὲ καὶ εἰς τὸ ξενοδοχεῖον ὅπου ἦν καταλύσας, καὶ εὗρον ἐκεῖ τὴν αὐλήτριαν κλαίουσαν καὶ ἀνιωμένην, ἐπειδὴ μὴ παρέλαβεν αὐτὴν μεθ ἑαυτοῦ. ἐξηγησαμένων δὲ αὐτῇ τὸ πρᾶγμα τὸ γεγονὸς ἐπὶ τῶν νεωτέρων ἐχάρη πάνυ ἀκούσασα, καὶ ἀποθεμένη τὴν λύπην εἶπεν· Νῦν εὗρον κἀγὼ ὧδε ἀνάπαυσιν. Καὶ ἀναστᾶσα ἀπῆλθεν πρὸς αὐτούς, καὶ ἦν σὺν αὐτοῖς χρόνον ἱκανόν, ἕως οὗ κατήχησαν καὶ τὸν βασιλέα. πολλοὶ δὲ καὶ τῶν ἀδελφῶν συνηθροίζοντο ἐκεῖ, ἕως ὅτε φήμης ἥκουσαν
τοῦἀποστόλου, ὅτι ἐν ταῖς πόλεσιν τῆς Ἰνδίας κατήχθη καὶ ἐκεῖ διδάσκει. καὶ ἀπελθόντες κατεμίγησαν αὐτῷ.
πράξεις Θωμᾶ ἀποστόλου. περὶ τῆς πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα Γουνδαφόρον εἰσελεύσεως αὐτοῦ.

Now when the king heard these things from the bridegroom and the bride, he rent his clothes and said unto them that stood by him: Go forth quickly and go about the whole city, and take and bring me that man that is a sorcerer who by ill fortune came unto this city; for with mine own hands I brought him into this house, and I told him to pray over this mine ill-starred daughter; and whoso findeth and bringeth him to me, I will give him whatsoever he asketh of me. They went, therefore, and went about seeking him, and found him not; for he had set sail. They went also unto the inn where he had lodged and found there the flute-girl weeping and afflicted because he had not taken her with him. And when they told her the matter that had befallen with the young people she was exceeding glad at hearing it, and put away her grief and said: Now have I also found rest here. And she rose up and went unto them, and was with them a long time, until they had instructed the king also. And many of the brethren also gathered there until they heard the report of the apostle, that he was come unto the cities of India and was teaching there: and they departed and joined themselves unto him.
### 17
Ὅτε δὲ εἰσῆλθεν ὁ ἀπόστολος εἰς τὰς πόλεις τῆς Ἰνδίας μετὰ Ἀββάνη τοῦ ἐμπόρου, ἀπῆλθεν ὁ Ἀββάνης εἰς ἀσπασμὸν Γουνδαφόρου τοῦ βασιλέως, προσανήνεγκεν δὲ αὐτῷ περὶ τοῦ τέκτονος ὃν μετ αὐτοῦ ἤγαγεν. ἐχάρη δὲ ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ πρὸς αὐτὸν εἰσελθεῖν αὐτὸν προσέταξεν. εἰσελθόντος

οὖν αὐτοῦ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ βασιλεύς· Ποίαν τέχνην ἐπίστασαι; Λέγει αὐτῷ ὁ ἀπόστολος· Τὴν τεκτονικὴν καὶ τὴν οἰκοδομικήν. Λέγει αὐτῷ ὁ βασιλεύς· Τίνα οὖν οἶδας ἐν ξύλοις ἐργασίαν, καὶ τίνα ἐν λίθοις; Λέγει ὁ ἀπόστολος· Ἐν μὲν ξύλοις ἄροτρα ζυγοὺς τρυτάνας τροχιλέας καὶ πλοῖα καὶ κώπας καὶ ἱστούς, ἐν δὲ λίθοις στήλας ναοὺς καὶ πραιτώρια βασιλικά. Καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς εἶπεν· Οἰκοδομεῖς μοι παλάτιον; Ὃ δὲ ἀπεκρίθη· Ναί, οἰκοδομῶ καὶ τελίσκω· διὰ τοῦτο γὰρ ἦλθον, οἰκοδομῆσαι καὶ τεκτονεῦσαι.

The Second Act: concerning his coming unto the king Gundaphorus.

Now when the apostle was come into the cities of India with Abbanes the merchant, Abbanes went to salute the king Gundaphorus, and reported to him of the carpenter whom he had brought with him. And the king was glad, and commanded him to come in to him. So when he was come in the king said unto him: What craft understandest thou? The apostle said unto him: The craft of carpentering and of building. The king saith unto him: What craftsmanship, then, knowest thou in wood, and what in stone? The apostle saith: In wood: ploughs, yokes, goads, pulleys, and boats and oars and masts; and in stone: pillars, temples, and court-houses for kings. And the king said: Canst thou build me a palace? And he answered: Yea, I can both build and furnish it; for to this end am I come, to build and to do the work of a carpenter.

Πρᾶξις ε περὶ τοῦ δαίμονος τοῦ ἐνοικήσαντος εἰς τὴν γυναῖκα.
(39) Εἰσῆλθεν δὲ ὁ ἀπόστολος εἰς τὴν πόλιν τοῦ παντὸς ὄχλου ἀκολουθοῦντος αὐτῷ· ἐσκέπτετο δὲ ἀπελθεῖν πρὸς τοὺς γονεῖς τοῦ νεωτέρου ὃν ἐζωοποίησεν θανόντα ὑπὸ τοῦ δράκοντος· πάνυ γὰρ ἐδέοντο αὐτοῦ παραγενέσθαι πρὸς αὐτοὺς καὶ εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτῶν. γυνὴ δέ τις πάνυ ὡραία αἰφνιδίως φωνὴν ἀφῆκε μεγίστην λέγουσα·

The Fifth Act: concerning the devil that took up his abode in the woman

And the apostle entered into the city and all the multitude followed him. And he thought to go unto the parents of the young man whom he had made alive when he was slain by the serpent; for they earnestly besought him to come unto them and enter into their house. But a very beautiful woman on a sudden uttered an exceeding loud cry, saying: O Apostle of the new God that art come into India, and servant of that holy and only good God; for by thee is he preached, the Saviour of the souls that come unto him, and by thee are healed the bodies of them that are tormented by the enemy, and thou art he that is become an occasion of life unto all that turn unto him: command me to be brought before thee that I may tell thee what hath befallen me, and peradventure of thee I may have hope, and these that stand by thee may be more confident in the God whom thou preachest. For I am not a little tormented by the adversary now this five years’ space [*] I was sitting at the first in quiet, and peace encompassed me on every side and I had no care for anything, for I took no thought for any other.
### 62
Πρᾶξις ζ περὶ τοῦ στρατηλάτου.

The Seventh Act: of the Captain.

Now while the apostle Thomas was proclaiming throughout all India the word of God, a certain captain of the king Misdaeus [*] came to him and said unto him: I have heard of thee that thou takest no reward of any man, but even that thou hast thou givest to them that need. For if thou didst receive rewards, I would have sent thee a great sum, and would not have come myself, for the king doeth nought without me: for I have much substance and am rich, even one of the rich men of India. And I have never done wrong to any; but the contrary hath befallen me. I have a wife, and of her I had a daughter, and I am well affectioned toward her, as also nature requireth, and have never made trial of another wife. Now it chanced that there was a wedding in our city, and they that made the marriage feast were well beloved of me: they came in therefore and bade

me to it, bidding also my wife and her daughter. Forasmuch then as they were my good friends I could not refuse: I sent her therefore, though she desired not to go, and with them I sent also many servants: so they departed, both she and her daughter, decked with many ornaments.

i. Prehistory: Abraham The Iconoclast (1–8)

i.i. Abraham Tests Idols (1–2)

### c1
i.i.i. Fall of Mar-Umath (1)

1:1 
On the day when I was destroying the gods of my father Terah and the gods of my brother Nahor, when I was testing which one was the truly strong god, 
1:2 
at the time when my lot came up, when I had finished the services of my father Terah’s sacrifice to his gods of wood, stone, gold, silver, brass and iron, 
1:3 
I, Abraham, having entered their temple for the service, found a god named Mar-Umath, carved out of stone, fallen at the feet of an iron god, Nakhon. 
1:4 
And it came to pass, that when I saw this, my heart was troubled. And I fell to thinking, because I, Abraham, was unable to return him to his place all by myself, since he was heavier than a great stone. 
1:5 
And I went and told my father. And he entered with me. 
1:6 
And as we both were moving him [Mar-Umath] to return him in his place, his head fell off of him, while I was still holding him by his head. 
1:7 
And it came to pass, when my father saw that the head of Mar-Umath had fallen off of him, he said to me, “Abraham!” 
1:8 
And I said, “Here am I!” And he said to me, “Bring me an axe and a chisel from the house.” 
1:9 
And I brought [them] to him from the house. And he carved another Mar-Umath, out of another stone, without a head, and [placed on him] the head that had been thrown down from Mar-Umath, and smashed the rest of Mar-Umath.

### c2

i.i.ii. Fall of Five Idols (2)

2:1 
And he made five other gods, and he gave them to me [and] told me to sell them outside in the street of the town. 
2:2 
And I saddled my father’s ass and put them on it [and] went out to the main road to sell them. 
2:3 And behold, merchants from Paddan Aram came with camels to go to Egypt to buy kokonil from the Nile there. 
2:4 
And I greeted them and they answered me. And I began to talk with them. One of their camels bellowed. The ass took fright and he ran and threw down the gods. And three of them were smashed and two remained. 
2:5 
And it came to pass, when the Syrians saw that I had gods, they said to me, “Why did you not tell us that you had gods? We would have bought them before the ass heard the camel’s cry and you would have had no loss. 
2:6 
Give us at least the remaining gods and we will give you a proper price.” 
2:7 
And I thought [it over] in my heart. And they gave [also] the price of the smashed gods for the gods that remained. 
2:8 
Since I had been distressed in my heart [wondering], “How would I let my father know about the matter?!” 
2:9 
And the debris of the smashed [gods] I cast into the water of the river Gur, which was at that place. And they sank into the depths and were no more.

### c3

i.ii. Abraham Reflects on Idolatry (3)

3:1 
And while I was still walking on the road, my heart was disturbed and my mind was distracted. And I said in my heart, 
3:2 
“What is the profit of the labor which my father is doing? 3:3 
Is not he rather a god of his gods, since by his sculpting, carving and skill they come into being? 
3:4 
It would be more fitting for them to worship my father, since they are his work. What gain is there for my father in his own works? 
3:5 
Behold, Mar-Umath fell and was unable to get up again in his own temple, nor could I lift him on my own, until my father came and we both lifted him. 
3:6 
And as we were unable, his head fell off of him. And he placed it on another stone of another god, which he had made without a head. 
3:7 
And [likewise were] the other five gods which were smashed down from the ass, which were able neither to save themselves nor to hurt the ass for it smashed them, nor did their shards come up from the river.” 
3:8 
And I said to myself, “If it is thus, how then can my father’s god, Mar-Umath, having a head of one stone and [the rest] being made of another stone, save a man, or hear a man’s prayer and reward him?”

And thinking thus, I came to my father’s house and watered the ass and set out hay for it. I brought out the money and gave it into the hand of my father Terah. 
4:2 
When he saw it, he was glad, and he said, “Blessed by my gods are you, Abraham, for you gave honor to the gods, so that my labor was not in vain!” 
4:3 
And I declared and said to him, “Hear, Terah, [my] father! It is the gods who are blessed by you, since you are a god to them, since you have made them; since their blessing is perdition, and their power is vain. 
4:4 
They could not help themselves, how [then] will they help you or bless me? 
4:5 
[In fact] I was for you a kind god of this gain, since it was through my cleverness that I brought you the money for the smashed [gods].” 
4:6 
And when he heard my word, his anger was kindled against me, since I had spoken harsh words against his gods.

### c5
i.iii.ii. Fall of Bar-Eshath (5)

##### 5:1 
When I saw my father’s anger, I went out. And afterward, when I had gone out, he called me, saying, “Abraham!” 
##### 5:2 
And I said, “Here am I!” 
5:3 
And he said, “Gather and take the splinters from the wood out of which I was making wooden gods before you came [and] cook me a meal!” 
5:4 
And it came to pass, when I was collecting the wooden splinters, I found among them a small god, lying among the pieces of wood on my left. 
5:5 
And on his forehead was written: “god Bar-Eshath.” 
5:6 
And it came to pass, when I found him, I held back and did not tell my father that I had found the wooden god Bar-Eshath among the chips. And it came to pass, after I had put the splinters on the fire, in order to cook food for my father, that I went out to ask about the food and I put Bar-Eshath near the hearth of fire, saying to him menacingly, 
5:7 
“Bar-Eshath, make sure that the fire does not go out before I come back. If the fire does go out, blow on it to make it flare up.” 
5:8 
[And] I went out, having kindled my fire. 
5:9 
When I came back again I found Bar-Eshath fallen backwards, his feet enveloped in fire and terribly burned. 
5:10 
Laughing greatly to myself, I said, “Bar-Eshath, you certainly are able to kindle fire and cook food!” 
5:11 And it came to pass, while I was speaking laughingly, that he was gradually burned up by the fire and became ashes. 
5:12 
And I brought the food to my father, [and] he ate. 
5:13 
And I gave him wine and milk, and he drank and satiated himself and blessed Mar-Umath, his god. 
5:14 
And I said to him, “Father Terah, do not bless your god Mar-Umath, do not praise him! Praise rather your god Bar-Eshath because, in his love for you he threw himself into the fire in order to cook your food.” 
5:15 
And he said to me, “And where is he now?” 
5:16 
“He has been reduced to ashes in the fury of the fire and become dust.” 
5:17 
And he said, “Great is the power of Bar-Eshath! I shall make another today, and tomorrow he will make my food!”

### c6
i.iii.iii. Hierarchy of Gods (6)

6:1 
When I, Abraham, heard such words from my father, I [both] laughed in my mind and [yet] groaned in the bitterness and anger of my soul. 
6:2 
And I said, “How can a statue made by my father [ever] be his helper? 
6:3 
Or would he have subordinated his body to his soul, his soul to his spirit, then his spirit—to folly and ignorance?” 
6:4 
And I said, “Must one put up with evil? Let me risk my life for purity and I shall put forth my own clear thinking before him!” 
6:5 
I declared and said, “Father Terah, whichever of these gods you praise, you err in your thinking. 
6:6 
Behold, my brother Nahor’s gods standing in the holy temple are more honored than yours. 
6:7 
For behold, Zoukh, my brother Nahor’s god, is more honored than your god Mar-Umath, since he is made of gold sold by men. 
6:8 
And if he becomes worn out with the years, he will be remade, whereas Mar-Umath, if he is changed or broken, will not be remade, since he is of stone. 
6:9 
[And] what about Yoavon, a god who is in the power of another god, who stands beside Zoukh? Since [even] he is more honored than the god Bar-Eshath who is made of wood, while [Yoavon is] forged of silver. And being better proportioned, he is sold by men in order to show him. 
6:10 
But Bar-Eshath , your god, before he was made had been rooted in the ground. 
6:11 
Being great and wondrous, with branches, flowers and [various] beauties. 
6:12 
And you cut him with an ax, and by your skill the god was made. 
6:13 
And behold, he has dried up, and his sap is gone. 
6:14 
He fell from the heights to the ground, and he went from greatness to insignificance, 
6:15 
and his appearance has faded. 
6:16 
[Now] he himself has been burned up by the fire, 
6:17 and he turned into ashes and is no more. 
6:18 
Yet you say: “Today I shall make another one, and tomorrow he will make my food.” 
6:19 
[But] he retained no strength utterly perishing!

### c7
i.iii.iv. Hierarchy of Natural Elements and Luminaries (7)

7:1 
This I say: 
7:2 
Fire is the noblest [element] in the image [of the world], since even the things which are [otherwise] unsubdued are subdued in it, and [since] it mocks with its flames the things which perish easily. 
7:3 
But I would not call it a god either, since it is subjugated to water. 
7:4 
Water is indeed nobler, since it overcomes fire and soaks the earth. 
7:5 
But I would not call it a god, since it is subjugated to the earth, running underneath it. 
7:6 
I would rather call the earth the noblest, since it overcomes the substance and abundance of water. 
##### 7:7 
But neither would I call it gods, since it is dried up by the sun [and since it is] made for men to plow. 
##### 7:8 
[So] I would call the sun nobler than the earth, since with its rays it illumines the inhabited world and the various airs. 
##### 7:9 
But I would not make it into a god either, since its course is obscured [both] at night [and] by the clouds. 
##### 7:10 
Nor, again, would I call the moon and the stars gods, since they too in their times at night can darken their light.
##### ?
i.iii.iv. Monotheistic Conclusion (7:11–12)

##### 7:11 
Listen, Terah, my father, I shall seek in your presence the God who created all the gods which we consider! 
##### 7:12 
For who is it, or which one is it who colored heaven and made the sun golden, who has given light to the moon and the stars with it, who has dried the earth in the midst of many waters, who set you yourself among the elements, and who now has chosen me in the distraction of my mind?— Will he reveal himself by himself to us?— [He is] the God!”

### c8
i.iii.vi. Punishment of Terah (8)

##### 8:1 
And as I was thinking about these things, here is what happened to my father Terah in the courtyard of his house: The voice of the Mighty One came down from heaven in a stream of fire, saying and calling, “Abraham, Abraham!” 
##### 8:2 
And I said, “Here am I!” 
##### 8:3 
And he said, “In the wisdom of your heart you are searching for the God of gods and the Creator. I am he! 
##### 8:4 
Leave Terah your father, and leave the house, so that you too are not slain for the sins of your father’s house!” 
##### 8:5 
And I went out. And it came to pass as I was going out, that I had not even gotten as far as going beyond the doors of the courtyard, 
##### 8:6 
when the sound of thunder came forth and burned him and his house and everything in the house, down to the ground [to a distance of] forty cubits.

ii. Revelation (9–32)

ii.i. Sacrifice (9–14)

### c9
ii.i.i. Command on Sacrifice (9)

##### 9:1 
Then came a voice saying to me twice, “Abraham, Abraham!” 
##### 9:2 
And I said “Here am I!” 
##### 9:3 
And he said, “Behold, it is I! Fear not, for I am the primordial and mighty God, who initially created the two luminaries of the world. 
#### 9:4 
I protect you and I am your helper. 
##### 9:5 
Go, take for me a heifer in her third year, and a she-goat in her third year, and ram in his third year, and a turtledove, and a pigeon, and set out for me a pure sacrifice. And in this sacrifice I shall set before you the ages 
##### 9:6 
and make you know secrets, and you will see great things which you have not seen, since you loved to search for me, and I called you ‘my friend.’ 
##### 9:7 
But for forty days abstain from every food which issues from fire, and from the drinking of wine, and from anointing [yourself] with oil. 
##### 9:8 
And then you shall set out for me the sacrifice which I have commanded you, in the place which I shall show you on a high mountain. 
##### 9:9 
And there shall I show you the ages: things built and firmed, made and renewed by my word. 
##### 9:10 
And I shall make you know what will come to pass in them on those who have done evil and [those who have done] just things among the race of men.”

18.3 And he said to me: "Fear not, for as soon as you eat of it, you too shall be as gods, in that you shall know what is good and what is evil.
18.4 But God knew that you would be like Him, so he envied you and said, 'You shall not eat of it.'
18.5 But, do give heed to the plant and you will see its great glory." I gave heed to the plant and saw it great glory. I said to him that it was pleasing to the eyes.

19.3 And when he had received the oath from me, he came and entered and placed upon the fruit the poison of his wickedness -- which is (the sense of) desire, for it is the beginning of every sin -- and he bent the branch on the earth and I took of the fruit and I ate.

Expulsion - [go to original Greek]

29.1 When the Lord had said these things he ordered us to be cast out of paradise.
29.2 But your father Adam wept before the angels opposite paradise and the angels said to him: "What would you have us to do, Adam?"
29.3 And your father said to them, "Behold, you cast me out. I pray you, allow me to take away fragrant herbs from paradise, so that I may offer an offering to God after I have gone out of paradise that he hear me."
29.4 And the angels approached God and said: "JAEL, Eternal King, command, my Lord, that there be given to Adam incense of sweet odor from paradise."
29.5 And God commanded it to be so for Adam that he might take sweet spices and seeds for his food.
29.6 And as the angels let him go he took four kinds: crocus and nard and calamus and cinnamon and the other seeds for his food: and, after taking these, he went out of paradise. And we were on the earth.
Discovery of Expulsion - [go to original Greek]

29.7 [The following epitome of the penitence narrative is found in just a few of the Greek manuscripts, most omit it entirely.] And we grieved for seven days and after seven days we grew hungry and I said to Adam: "Rise and give some thought to food that we might eat and live and so that we do not die. Let us get up and circle the earth perhaps God will hear us." We arose and went about the entire earth but we did not find food.
29.8 And I answered and said to Adam: "Rise, O Lord and destroy me that I might cease from before you and from before God and the angels (and) so that they might cease their anger toward you on my account."
29.9 Then Adam answered and said to me, "For what reason do you call to mind this evil that I could commit murder and impose death upon my rib. How could I lift a hand against the image of God which he made? Rather let us repent for forty days so that God may have mercy on us and give to us better food than the animals.
29.10 I will do forty days of penitence whereas you shall do 34 days for you were not made on the sixth day when God made his creation. Arise and go to the Tigris river and take a stone and put it under your feet and stand there covered in the water up to your neck and let not a word come from your mouth for we are not worthy and our lips are unclean."
29.11 Adam went to the Jordan river and the hair of his head was spread out as he prayed in the water. And he cried in a loud voice saying: "I say to the waters of the Jordan stand still and pray with me even all the beasts, all the birds, and all which creeps on the land and the sea." And all the angels and all things made by God circled Adam like a wall around him and cried while praying to God on behalf of Adam so that God might hearken to him.
29.12 But the devil, not finding a place with respect to Adam, came to the Tigris river to me. And assuming the form of an angel he stood before me weeping and his tears flowed upon the ground. And he said to me, "Come forth from the water and cease your crying, for God has heard your request because even we, the angels, and all things made by him, have beseeched God on your behalf.
29.13 And when he said these things, the enemy deceived me a second time. And I came out of the water.

### [The Creation of Adam.]

Now the formation of Adam took place in this wise: On the Sixth Day, which is the Eve of the Sabbath, at the first hour of the day, when quietness was reigning over [Fol. 4b, col. 2] all the Ranks [of the Angels], and the hosts [of heaven], God said, "Come ye, let Us make man in Our image, and according to Our likeness." Now by this word "Us" He maketh known concerning the Glorious Persons [of the Trinity]. And when the angels heard this utterance, they fell into a state of fear and trembling, and they said to one another, "A mighty miracle will be made manifest to us this day [that is to say], the likeness of God, our Maker." And they saw the right hand of God opened out flat, and stretched out over the whole world; and all creatures were collected in the palm of His right hand. And they saw that He took from the whole mass of the earth one grain of dust, and from the whole nature of water one drop of p. 52 water, and from all the air which is above one puff of wind, and from the whole nature of fire a little of its heat and warmth. And the angels saw that when these four feeble (or inert) materials were placed in the palm of His right hand [Fol. 5a, col. 1], that is to say, cold, and heat, and dryness, and moisture, God formed Adam. Now, for what reason did God make Adam out of these four materials unless it were [to show] that everything which is in the world should be in subordination to him through them? He took a grain from the earth in order that everything in nature which is formed of earth should be subject unto him; and a drop of water in order that everything which is in the seas and rivers should be his; and a puff of air so that all kinds [of creatures] which fly in the air might be given unto him; and the heat of fire so that all the beings that are fiery in nature, and the celestial hosts, might be his helpers.

God formed Adam with His holy hands, in His own Image and Likeness, and when the angels saw Adam's glorious appearance they were greatly moved by the beauty thereof. For they saw [Fol. 5a, col. 2] the image of his face burning with glorious splendour like the orb of the sun, and the light of his eyes was like the light of the sun, and the image of his body was like unto the sparkling of crystal. And p. 53 when he rose at full length and stood upright in the centre of the earth, he planted his two feet on that spot whereon was set up the Cross of our Redeemer; for Adam was created in Jerusalem. There he was arrayed in the apparel of sovereignty, and there was the crown of glory set upon his head, there was he made king, and priest, and prophet, there did God make him to sit upon his honourable throne, and there did God give him dominion over all creatures and things. And all the wild beasts, and all the cattle, and the feathered fowl were gathered together, and they passed before Adam and he assigned names to them; and they bowed their heads before him; and eveything in nature worshipped him [Fol. 5b, col. 1], and submitted themselves unto him. And the angels and the hosts of heaven heard the Voice of God saying unto him, "Adam, behold; I have made thee king, and priest, and prophet, and lord, and head, and governor of everything which hath been made and created; and they shall be in subjection unto thee, and they shall be thine, and I have given unto thee power over everything which I have created." And when the angels heard this speech they all bowed the knee and worshipped Him.

 
### [THE REVOLT OF SATAN, AND THE BATTLE IN HEAVEN.]

And when the prince of the lower order of angels saw what great majesty had been given unto Adam, he was jealous of him from that day, and he did not wish to worship him. And he said unto his hosts, "Ye shall not worship him, and ye shall not praise him with the angels. It is meet that ye should worship me, because I am fire and spirit; and not that I should worship a thing of dust, which hath been fashioned of fine dust." And the Rebel meditating these things [Fol. 5b, col. 2] would not render obedience to God, and of his own free will he asserted his independence and separated himself from God. But he was swept away out of heaven and fell, and the fall of himself and of all his company from heaven took place on the p. 56 Sixth Day, at the second hour of the day. And the apparel of their glorious state was stripped off them. And his name was called "Sâtânâ" because he turned aside [from the right way], and "Shêdâ" because he was cast out, and "Daiwâ" because he lost the apparel of his glory. And behold, from that time until the present day, he and all his hosts have been stripped of their apparel, and they go naked and have horrible faces. And when Sâtânâ was cast out from heaven, Adam was raised up so that he might ascend to Paradise in a chariot of fire. And the angels went before him, singing praises, and the Seraphim ascribed holiness unto him, and the Cherubim ascribed blessing; and amid cries of joy and praises Adam went into [Fol. 6a, col. 1] Paradise. And as soon as Adam entered Paradise he was commanded not to eat of a [certain] tree; his entrance into heaven took place at the third hour of the Eve of the Sabbath (i.e. on Friday morning).
### [SATAN'S ATTACK ON ADAM AND EVE.]

And when Satan saw that Adam and Eve were happy and joyful in Paradise, that Rebel was smitten sorely with jealousy, and he became filled with wrath. And he went and took up his abode in the serpent, and he raised him up, and made him to fly through the air to the skirts of Mount [Eden] whereon was Paradise [Fol. 6b, col. 2]. Now, why did Satan enter the body of the serpent and hide himself therein? Because he knew that his appearance was foul, and that if Eve saw his form, she would betake herself to flight straightway before him. Now, the man who wished to teach the Greek language to a bird--now the bird that can learn the speech of men p. 64 is called "babbaghah" (i.e. parrot)--first bringeth a large mirror and placeth between himself and the bird. He then beginneth to talk to the bird, and immediately the parrot heareth the voice of the man, it turneth round, and when it seeth its own form [reflected] in the mirror, it becometh pleased straightway, because it imagineth that a fellow parrot is talking to it. Then it inclineth its ear with pleasure, and listeneth to the words of the man who is talking to it, and it becometh eager to learn, and to speak Greek. In this manner (i.e. with the object of making Eve believe that it was the serpent that spoke to her) did Satan enter in and dwell in the serpent, and he watched for the opportunity, and [when] he saw Eve by herself [Fol. 7a, col. 1], he called her by her name. And when she turned round towards him, she saw her own form [reflected] in him, and she talked to him; and Satan led her astray with his lying words, because the nature of woman is soft (or, yielding).

And when Eve had heard from him concerning that tree, straightway she ran quickly to it, and she plucked the fruit of disobedience from the tree of transgression of the command, and she ate. Then immediately she found herself stripped naked, and she saw the hatefulness of her shame, and she ran away p. 65 naked, and hid herself in another tree, and covered her nakedness with the leaves thereof. And she cried out to Adam, and he came to her, and she handed to him some of the fruit of which she had eaten, and he also did eat thereof. And when he had eaten he also became naked, and he and Eve made girdles for their loins of the leaves of the fig-trees; and they were arrayed in these girdles of ignominy for three [Fol. 7a, col. 2] hours. At mid-day they received [their] sentence of doom. And God made for them tunics of skin which was stripped from the trees, that is to say, of the bark of the trees, because the trees that were in Paradise had soft barks, and they were softer than the byssus and silk wherefrom the garments worn by kings are made. And God dressed them in this soft skin, which was thus spread over a body of infirmities.
