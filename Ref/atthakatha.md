In the dispensation of the present Buddha he was reborn in the city of Rājagaha in a certain household possessed of an abundant store of food and drink. From the time he could walk, he would neither lie on a bed nor eat ordinary food, but ate only his own excrement. His mother and father brought him up, thinking: “He does this because he is too young to know any better.” But also when he grew older, refusing to wear clothes, he went naked, made his bed on the ground, and ate only his own excrement. Thought his mother and father: “This youth is not fit to live in a house. He is fit to live only with the Ājīvakas.” So they took him to the Ājīvakas and committed him to their charge, saying: “Admit this youth to your Saṅgha.” So they admitted him to their Saṅgha. In admitting him 

Gala-ppamāne āvāṭe thapetvā, dvinnam jattūnam upari padarāṇi datvā, tesaṃ upari nisīditvā, tāl'-aṭṭhi-khaṇḍena kese luñciṃsu.

they placed him in a pit up to his neck, laid planks over his two collarbones, and seating themselves on the planks, pulled out his hair with palmyra combs. 

His mother and father invited the Ājīvakas to be their guests on the following day and departed.

**Araññaṃ araññabhūtanti agāmakaṃ araññameva hutvā araññaṃ jātaṃ.**  
A wilderness became truly a wilderness, uninhabited, turning completely into a desolate forest.

**Isīnaṃ manopadosenāti isīnaṃ atthāya katena manopadosena taṃ manopadosaṃ asahamānāhi devatāhi tāni raṭṭhāni vināsitāni.**  
Due to the mental resentment that arose for the sake of the sages, the deities, unable to bear that resentment, destroyed those kingdoms.

**Lokikā pana isayo manaṃ padosetvā vināsayiṃsūti maññanti.**  
But ordinary people believe that the sages themselves harbored resentment and caused destruction.

**Tasmā imasmiṃ lokavāde ṭhatvāva idaṃ vādāropanaṃ katanti veditabbaṃ.**  
Therefore, based on this worldly belief, this assertion was made and should be understood as such.

---

**Tattha daṇḍakīraññādīnaṃ evaṃ araññabhūtabhāvo jānitabbo.**  
Thus, the way in which King Daṇḍakī and others ended up in a state of wilderness should be understood.

**Sarabhaṅgabodhisattassa tāva parisāya ativepullataṃ gatāya kisavaccho nāma tāpaso mahāsattassa antevāsī vivekavāsaṃ patthayamāno gaṇaṃ pahāya godhāvarītīrato kaliṅgaraṭṭhe daṇḍakīrañño kumbhapuraṃ nāma nagaraṃ upanissāya rājuyyāne vivekamanubrūhayamāno viharati.**  
When Sarabhaṅga Bodhisatta’s retinue grew excessively large, a certain ascetic named Kisavaccha, who was a disciple of the great being, desired solitude. Leaving the community behind, he moved from the banks of the Godhāvarī River to the land of Kaliṅga. He settled near King Daṇḍakī’s city, Kumbhapura, residing in the royal park to cultivate seclusion.

**Tassa senāpati upaṭṭhāko hoti.**  
The king’s chief minister was his supporter.


**Tadā ca ekā gaṇikā rathaṃ abhiruhitvā pañcamātugāmasataparivārā nagaraṃ upasobhayamānā vicarati.**  
At that time, a courtesan, accompanied by five hundred women, rode in a chariot, moving through the city, enhancing its splendor.

**Mahājano tameva olokayamāno parivāretvā vicarati, nagaravīthiyo nappahonti.**  
The people, captivated by her, gathered around, following her in large numbers, making the city streets too crowded to accommodate them.

**Rājā vātapānaṃ vivaritvā ṭhito taṃ disvā ‘kā esā’ti pucchi.**  
The king, standing by the open window, saw her and asked, “Who is this?”

**‘Tumhākaṃ nagarasobhinī devā’ti.**  
“She is the ornament of your city, lord,” they replied.

**So ussūyamāno ‘kiṃ etāya sobhati, nagaraṃ sayaṃ sobhissatī’ti taṃ ṭhānantaraṃ acchindāpesi.**  
Jealous, he thought, “Why should the city’s beauty depend on her? The city should shine on its own.” So, he ordered her position to be revoked.


**Sā tato paṭṭhāya kenaci saddhiṃ santhavaṃ katvā ṭhānantaraṃ pariyesamānā ekadivasaṃ rājuyyānaṃ pavisitvā caṅkamanakoṭiyaṃ ālambanaphalakaṃ nissāya pāsāṇaphalake nisinnaṃ tāpasaṃ disvā cintesi – ‘kiliṭṭho vatāyaṃ tāpaso anañjitamaṇḍito, dāṭhikāhi paruḷhāhi mukhaṃ pihitaṃ, massunā uraṃ pihitaṃ, ubho kacchā paruḷhā’ti.**  
From that moment, having lost her former status, she sought favor elsewhere. One day, while wandering, she entered the royal park and saw an ascetic sitting on a stone slab, leaning against a wooden support near the walking path. She thought to herself, “How filthy this ascetic looks! Unadorned, his mouth covered with overgrown teeth, his chest hidden beneath long, unkempt hair, and his armpits overgrown.”

**Athassā domanassaṃ uppajji – ‘ahaṃ ekena kiccena vicarāmi, ayañca me kāḷakaṇṇī diṭṭho, udakaṃ āharatha, akkhīni dhovissāmī’ti.**  
Disgust arose in her mind—“I roam the city for a purpose, but seeing this wretched man has brought me misfortune. Bring me water, I will wash my eyes.”

**Udakadantakaṭṭhaṃ āharāpetvā dantakaṭṭhaṃ khāditvā tāpasassa sarīre piṇḍaṃ piṇḍaṃ kheḷaṃ pātetvā dantakaṭṭhaṃ jaṭāmatthake khipitvā mukhaṃ vikkhāletvā udakaṃ tāpasassa matthakasmiṃyeva siñcitvā – ‘yehi me akkhīhi kāḷakaṇṇī diṭṭho, tāni dhotāni kalipavāhito’ti nikkhantā.**  
She had water and a teeth-cleaning stick brought to her. After chewing on the stick, she spat out bits of saliva onto the ascetic’s body, then threw the used stick onto his matted hair. Finally, she splashed water onto his head, saying, “The eyes that have seen this bearer of misfortune are now cleansed—the curse is washed away.” With that, she left.
