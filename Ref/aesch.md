Eratosthenes, Legends of the Constellations, 24. p. 140 (Robert), says of Orpheus that he paid no honour to Dionysus, but considered Helios to be the greatest of the gods and addressed him as Apollo; that, by making haste during the night, he reached at dawn the summit of Mt. Pangaeus, and waited there that he might see the rising of the sun; and that Dionysus, in his wrath, sent against him the Bassarides (as Aeschylus tells the story), who tore him to pieces and scattered his members, which were collected and buried by the Muses in Leibethra. To the same effect, Scholiast Germanicus, 84. 11.
The name Bassarai was given to Thracian (and to Phrygian and Lydian) bacchanals, who wore fox-skin caps and long embroidered cloaks, pictured in Miss Harrison’s Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion, 458. The word bassara (possibly of Phrygian origin but carried elsewhere) means “fox.” Cp. Fragment 29.
The play is entitled Bassarides in the Scholiast on Aristophanes, Thesmophoriazusae 135, and on Nicander, Theriaca 288.
To the Bassarae have been assigned Fragments 187. 215.

FRAGMENT 10
Hephaestion, Handbook of Metres 13. p. 43 (Consbruch) and Choeroboscus, Commentary p. 84. 3.

The bull was like to butt the goat with his horns . . .

Dionysus is the bull, the goat is Lycurgus, the king of the Edonians, who refused to adopt the worship of the god.

FRAGMENT 11
Scholiast on Nicander, Theriaca 288.

Old chips and sooty ashes on the altar

FRAGMENT 12
Scholiast (cod. Vaticanus Graecus 909) on Euripides, Rhesus 922.

For his gleaming torch doth flood with flashing light Pangaeus’ headland, silver-seamed.

Probably from the Messenger’s report to Dionysus concerning Orpheus ascent of the mountain to behold the rising sun.

ΣΙΣΥΦΟΣ: Ζαγρεῖ τε νῦν μοι καὶ πολυξένῳ <πατρὶ>
χαίρειν

Sisyphus: I now bid farewell to Zagreus and his ever-hospitable father.1

in Aeschylus' Egyptians (Aigyptioi), Zagreus was apparently identified with Hades himself
