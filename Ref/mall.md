SUMMARY: In fragment 62, Orpheus claimed that he did not invent his stories, but, rather, that he learned these things by petitioning Apollo himself.

62. Χρονογραφία Ἰωάννου Μαλάλα IV 88-92 p. 72, 16 Dind. (test. nr. 21) ~ Georg. Cedren. Histor. compend. I 101, 11 Bekk. vs. 1-3 etiam ap. Tzetz. Exeges. in Iliad. 53, 17 Herm.:

μετὰ δὲ βραχὺ ἡγήσατο τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ Γεδεών.  

“But shortly after, Gideôn (Γεδεών) became the leader of Israel. 

ἐν αὐτῷ δὲ τῷ χρόνῳ ἦν

Ὀρφεὺς ὁ Θρᾴξ, ὁ λυρικὸς Ὀδρυσαῖος (v. test. nr. 233 e), ὁ σοφώτατος καὶ περιβόητος ποιητής· 

Whereas (living) at that time was Thrakian Orphéfs (Ὀρφεὺς), the Odryssian (Thrakian) lyrist, a wise and famous poet. 

ὅστις ἐξέθετο θεογονίαν καὶ κόσμου κτίσιν καὶ ἀνθρώπων πλαστουργίαν, εἰρηκὼς ἐν τῇ ἀρχῇ τοῦ συντάγματος αὐτοῦ, ὅτι ἐκ τῆς ἰδίας αὐτοῦ ἐνθυμήσεως οὐκ ἐξέθετό τί ποτε περὶ θεοῦ ἢ τῆς κοσμικῆς κτίσεως, ἀλλ᾽ εἶπεν ὅτι | 73 Dind. αἰτησαμένου διὰ ἰδίας αὐτοῦ εὐχῆς μαθεῖν παρὰ τοῦ Φοίβου Τιτᾶνος Ἡλίου τὴν θεογονίαν καὶ τὴν τοῦ κόσμου κτίσιν καὶ τίς ἐποίησεν αὐτήν. 

He expounded the origin of the Gods and the creation of the kózmos and the generation of mankind, proclaiming at the beginning of his treatise, that from his own personal conception he assuredly did not invent anything concerning God or the creation of the world, but that he learned by petitioning through his own prayer from the Titan Phívos (Φοῖβος, i.e. Apollo), the Sun, the origin of the Gods and the creation of the world and who of his own accord produced it. 

ἐμφέρεται γὰρ ἐν τῇ αὐτοῦ ἐκθέσει διὰ ποιητικῶν στίχων οὕτως·

For he gave an account of his own exposition through lines of verse in this manner:

Ὦναξ, Λητοῦς υἱέ, ἑκατηβόλε, Φοῖβε κραταιέ,

Oh Lord, son of Lîtóh (Lêtô, Λητώ), far-shooter, mighty Phívos (Φοῖβος),

ὦ δέσποτα, ἡμέρας υἱέ, ὁ τὰ πάντα πόρρωθεν ταῖς ἀκτῖσί σου τοξεύων, ἀμίαντε

καὶ δυνατέ,

Oh Master, son of day, shooting from afar, you, in every way release rays, undefiled and powerful.

πανδερκές, θνητοῖσι καὶ ἀθανάτοισιν ἀνάσσων,

All-seeing, ruling over mortals and immortals,

ὁ τὰ πάντα ἐπιβλέπων, θνητῶν καὶ ἀθανάτων βασιλεύων,

Looking over everything attentively, king of mortals and immortals,

Ἥλιε χρυσέαισιν ἀειρόμενε πτερύγεσσιν,

Oh Sun, risen above on golden wings,

Ἥλιε τιμίαις εἰς τὸν ἀέρα ὑψούμενε πτέρυξι,

Oh Sun, you fly high with wings through the air,

δωδεκάτην δὴ τήνδε παραί σεο ἔκλυον ὀμφήν,

I heard your oracle nigh unto the twelfth time,

δωδεκάτην δὴ ταύτην παρά σου ἤκουσα θείαν φωνήν,

I heard your divine voice nigh unto the twelfth time.

σεῦ φαμένου· σὲ δέ γ' αὐτόν, ἑκηβόλε, μάρτυρα θείην. σοῦ εἰρηκότος μοι, σὲ δ᾽ αὐτὸν τὸν ἀπὸ μακρόθεν λάμποντα τίθημι.

Having thus spoken, and indeed from you, oh far-shooting one, my divine witness! From your words, and you, the very one shining from afar, I consider!

καὶ ἄλλους δὲ πολλοὺς περὶ τούτου εἶπε στίχους ὁ αὐτὸς Ὀρφεύς· ἔφρασε δὲ ὡς ἐκ τῶν προειρημένων στίχων ποιητικῶν ἐξέθετο· καὶ οὐκ ἐνεδέχετο ἐντάξαι τὸ πλῆθος τῶν στίχων | 74 Dind. ἐν τῇ συγγραφῇ ταύτῃ.

And Orphéfs himself uttered yet many other verses; whereas he spoke (in like manner) as set forth in those lines of verse above; and it is not possible to cite here such a great number of verses.’ | 74 Dind. in the book in this way.” (trans. by the author)

SUMMARY: Fragment 65 states, according to John Malalas (491-578 CE) the Syrian chronicler from Antioch, that Orpheus outlined the following sequence: the Incomprehensible One, Time, Aether, and Chaos. Under the Aether is everything; this everything is the possession of and is concealed by Nyx (Night). Earth was in this darkness, but the light of the Incomprehensible One broke through the Aether and illuminated everything. This Incomprehensible One is three-fold: Metis (Counselor), Phanes (Light), and Ericapaeus (Giver-of-Life). These three are one power of one God, who is the source of all creation.

Ὀρφεύς. ἔστι δὲ ἅπερ ἐξέθετο Ὀρφεὺς ταῦτα. 

“Orpheus. And this is what Orphéfs said. 

ὅτι ἐξ ἀρχῆς ἀνεδείχθη τῷ Χρόνῳ ὁ Αἰθὴρ ἀπὸ τοῦ θεοῦ δημιουργηθείς καὶ ἐντεῦθεν κἀκεῖθεν τοῦ Αἰθέρος ἦν Χάος, 

He declared that from the beginning (of everything), the Aithír followed after Time, created by the God. And henceforth Kháos (Χάος) follows next after the Aithír. 

καὶ Νὺξ ζοφερὰ πάντα κατεῖχε καὶ ἐκάλυπτε τὰ ὑπὸ τὸν Αἰθέρα, σημαίνων τὴν Νύκτα πρωτεύειν, 

And that gloomy Nyx (Night, Νὺξ) possesses all and conceals it under the Aithír, thus indicating that the first place belongs to Nyx. 

εἰρηκὼς ἐν τῇ αὐτοῦ ἐκθέσει ἀκατάληπτόν τινα καὶ πάντων ὑπέρτατον εἶναι, καὶ προγενέστερον δὲ καὶ δημιουργὸν ἁπάντων καὶ τοῦ Αἰθέρος αυτοῦ καὶ τῆς Νυκτὸς καὶ πάσης τῆς ὑπὸ τὸν Αἰθέρα οὔσης καὶ καλυπτομένης κτίσεως· 

He says here in his exposition that there is an incomprehensible one, who is the highest of all, and so, therefore, primeval, and creator of all, and the Aithír itself and Nyx and this which was beneath the Aithír concealing the foundation. 

τὴν δὲ Γῆν εἶπεν ὑπὸ τοῦ σκότους ἀόρατον οὖσαν· 

He then explained that the Earth was invisible under the darkness. 

ἔφρασε δὲ ὅτι τὸ φῶς ῥῆξαν τὸν Αἰθέρα ἐφώτισε τὴν Γῆν καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν κτίσιν, εἰπὼν ἐκεῖνο εἶναι τὸ φῶς τὸ ῥῆξαν τὸν Αἰθέρα τὸ προειρημένον, τὸ ὑπέρτατον πάντων, οὗ ὄνομα ὁ αὐτὸς Ὀρφεὺς ἀκούσας ἐκ τῆς μαντείας (v. fr. 62) ἐξεῖπε, Μῆτιν, Φάνητα, Ἠρικεπαῖον· 

He said that then the light broke through the Aithír and illuminated the earth and all of creation, declaring that the light which broke through the Aithír was the one spoken of previously, he who is highest of all, whose name Orphéfs himself heard from an oracle (v. fr. 62), and said it was Mítis (Μῆτις), Phánîs (Φάνης), Irikæpaios (Ἠρικεπαῖος). 

ὅπερ ἑρμηνεύεται τῇ κοινῇ γλώσσῃ βουλή, φῶς, ζῳοδοτήρ· εἰπὼν ἐν τῇ αὐτοῦ ἐκθέσει τὰς αὐτὰς τρεῖς θείας τῶν ὀνομάτων δυνάμεις μίαν εἶναι δύναμιν καὶ κράτος τοῦ μόνου θεοῦ, ὃν οὐδεὶς ὁρᾷ, 

These three can be interpreted in ordinary language as, “Counselor, Light, Giver-of-Life!” He said in his exposition that those three sacred things, bearing those names, are one power, and are the strength of one God, whom no-one can see. 

ἧστινος δυνάμεως οὐδεὶς δύναται γνῶναι ἰδέαν ἢ φύσιν, 

Concerning this power, no-one has the capability to understand its form or nature. 

ἐξ αὐτῆς δὲ τῆς δυνάμεως τὰ πάντα γεγενῆσθαι, καὶ ἀρχὰς ἀσωμάτους καὶ ἥλιον καὶ σελήνην, ἐξουσίας καὶ ἄστρα πάντα καὶ γῆν καὶ θάλασσαν, τὰ ὁρώμενα ἐν αὐτοῖς πάντα καὶ τὰ ἀόρατα.

From this power of itself everything came into being, the unembodied beginning, the sun and the moon, the magistrates, and all the stars and the earth and the sea, all that which is perceptible in them and that which is unseen.” (trans. by the author)
