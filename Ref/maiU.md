### 3
द्वे वाव ब्रह्मणो रूपे मूर्तं चामूर्तं च । 

There are two forms of Brahman 4, the material (effect) and the immaterial (cause). 

अथ यन्मूर्तं तदसत्यम्  

The material is false, the immaterial is true. 

यदमूर्तं तत्सत्यम् तद्ब्रह्म तज्ज्योतिः यज्ज्योतिः स आदित्यः 

That which is true is Brahman, that which is Brahman is light, and that which is light is the Sun 5. 

स वा एष ओमित्येतदात्माभवत्  

And this Sun became the Self of that Om.

स त्रेधात्मानं व्याकुरुत ओमिति  तिस्रो मात्रा  

He divided himself threefold, for Om consists of three letters, a + u + m. 

एताभिः सर्वमिदमोतं प्रोतं चैवास्मीति  

Through them all this 1 is contained in him as warp and woof. 

एवं ह्याहैतद्वा 

For thus it is said:

आदित्य ओमित्येवं ध्यायत आत्मानं युञ्जीतेति ॥ ३॥

'Meditate on that Sun as Om, join your Self (the breath) with the (Self of the) Sun.'
