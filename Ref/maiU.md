द्वे वाव ब्रह्मणो रूपे मूर्तं चामूर्तं च । 

There are two forms of Brahman 4, the material (effect) and the immaterial (cause). 

अथ यन्मूर्तं तदसत्यम्  

The material is false, the immaterial is true. 

यदमूर्तं तत्सत्यम् तद्ब्रह्म तज्ज्योतिः यज्ज्योतिः स आदित्यः 

That which is true is Brahman, that which is Brahman is light, and that which is light is the Sun 5. 

स वा एष ओमित्येतदात्माभवत्  

And this Sun became the Self of that Om.

स त्रेधात्मानं व्याकुरुत ओमिति  तिस्रो मात्रा  

He divided himself threefold, for Om consists of three letters, a + u + m. 

एताभिः सर्वमिदमोतं प्रोतं चैवास्मीति  

Through them all this 1 is contained in him as warp and woof. 

एवं ह्याहैतद्वा 

For thus it is said:

आदित्य ओमित्येवं ध्यायत आत्मानं युञ्जीतेति ॥ ३॥

'Meditate on that Sun as Om, join your Self (the breath) with the (Self of the) Sun.'

अथेदानीं ज्ञानोपसर्गा 

8 Now follow the impediments in the way of knowledge, 

राजन्मोहजालस्यैष वै योनिः  

O King 1! This is indeed the origin of the net of bewilderment, 

यदस्वर्गैः सह स्वर्गस्यैष वाट्ये पुरस्तादुक्तेऽप्यधः स्तम्बेनाश्लिष्यन्ति

that one who is worthy of heaven lives with those who are not worthy of heaven. That is it. Though they have been told that there is a grove before them, they cling to a small shrub. 

अथ ये चान्ये ह नित्यप्रमुदिता नित्यप्रवसिता  नित्ययाचनका नित्यं शिल्पोपजीविनोऽथ 

And others also who are always merry, always abroad, always begging, always making a living by handiwork; 

ये चान्ये ह पुरयाचका अयाज्ययाचकाः शुद्रशिष्याः  शूद्रश्च शास्त्रविद्वांसोऽथ 

and others who are begging in towns, performing sacrifices for those who are not allowed to offer sacrifices, who make themselves the pupils of Sûdras, and Sûdras who know the sacred books; 

ये चान्ये ह चाटजटनटभटप्रव्रजितरङ्गावतारिणो राजकर्मणि पतितादयोऽथ 

and others who are malignant, who use bad language, dancers, prize-fighters, travelling mendicants, actors, those who have been degraded in the king's service; 

ये चान्ये ह यक्षराक्षसभूतगणपिशाचोरगग्रहादीनामर्थं पुरस्कृत्य शमयाम इत्येवं ब्रुवाणा  

and others who for money pretend that they can lay (the evil influences) of Yakshas, Râkshasas, ghosts, goblins, devils, serpents, imps, &c.; 

अथ ये चान्ये ह वृथा कषायकुण्डलिनः कापालिनोऽथ 

and others who falsely wear red dresses 2, earrings, and skulls; 

ये चान्ये ह वृथा तर्कदृष्टान्तकुहकेन्द्रजालैर्वैदिकेषु परिस्थातुमिच्छन्ति  तैः सह
न संवस्त्  

and others who wish to entice by the jugglery of false arguments, mere comparisons and paralogisms, the believers in the Veda--with all these he should not live together. 

प्रकाश्यभूता वै ते तस्करा अस्वर्ग्या इत्येवं ह्याह   :  

They are clearly thieves, and unworthy of heaven. And thus it is said:

नैरात्म्यवादकुहकैर्मिथ्यादृष्टान्तहेतुभिः ।
भ्राम्यन्लोको न जानाति वेदविद्यान्तरन्तु यत् ॥

'The world unsettled by the paralogisms of the denial of Self, by false comparisons and arguments, does not know what is the difference between Veda and philosophy 1.'
