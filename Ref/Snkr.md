#### 2.2.37
पत्युरसामञ्जस्यात्।।2.2.37।।

The Lord's (being merely the efficient cause of the world cannot hold good) on account of the inconsistency (of that doctrine).

पत्यधिकरणम्।।2.2.37।।

इदानीं केवलाधिष्ठात्रीश्वरकारणवादः प्रतिषिध्यते।  
*Now, the doctrine of God as the sole ruler and cause is refuted.*

तत्कथमवगम्यते 
*How is this understood?*

प्रकृतिश्च प्रतिज्ञादृष्टान्तानुपरोधात् अभिध्योपदेशाच्च इत्यत्र प्रकृतिभावेन अधिष्ठातृभावेन च उभयस्वभावस्येश्वरस्य स्वयमेव आचार्येण प्रतिष्ठापितत्वात्  
*Because the nature of Prakṛti (primordial matter) and the role of the ruler are established by the teacher himself, without contradicting the proposition, example, and teaching, and because God is established as having both the nature of Prakṛti and the role of the ruler.*

यदि पुनरविशेषेणेश्वरकारणवादमात्रमिह प्रतिषिध्येत 
*If, however, the doctrine of God as the sole cause were to be refuted without distinction,*

पूर्वोत्तरविरोधाद्व्याहताभिव्याहारः सूत्रकार इत्येतदापद्येत  
*it would lead to a contradiction between the earlier and later statements, and the author of the sūtras would be accused of inconsistency.*

तस्मादप्रकृतिरधिष्ठाता केवलं निमित्तकारणमीश्वरः इत्येष पक्षो वेदान्तविहितब्रह्मैकत्वप्रतिपक्षत्वात् यत्नेनात्र प्रतिषिध्यते।  
*Therefore, the view that God is the sole ruler and only the efficient cause, without being the material cause (Prakṛti), is refuted here with great effort because it opposes the Vedāntic doctrine of the oneness of Brahman.*

सा चेयं वेदबाह्येश्वरकल्पना अनेकप्रकारा केचित्तावत्सांख्ययोगव्यपाश्रयाः कल्पयन्ति प्रधानपुरुषयोरधिष्ठाता केवलं निमित्तकारणमीश्वरः इतरेतरविलक्षणाः प्रधानपुरुषेश्वरा इति  
*This conception of God, external to the Vedas, is of many kinds. Some, relying on Sāṅkhya and Yoga, conceive of God as the ruler of Prakṛti and Puruṣa, the sole efficient cause, distinct from both Prakṛti and Puruṣa.*

माहेश्वरास्तु मन्यन्ते कार्यकारणयोगविधिदुःखान्ताः पञ्च पदार्थाः पशुपतिनेश्वरेण पशुपाशविमोक्षणायोपदिष्टाः पशुपतिरीश्वरो निमित्तकारणमिति  
*The followers of Maheśvara, however, believe that the five categories—effect, cause, union, ritual, and the end of suffering—were taught by Lord Paśupati for the liberation of beings from bondage, and that Paśupati, the Lord, is the efficient cause.*

तथा वैशेषिकादयोऽपि केचित्कथंचित्स्वप्रक्रियानुसारेण निमित्तकारणमीश्वरम् इति।  
*Similarly, some followers of Vaiśeṣika and others, in accordance with their own systems, consider God as the efficient cause.*

अत उत्तरमुच्यते पत्युरसामञ्जस्यादिति  
*Therefore, the reply is given: "Because of the inconsistency of the Lord."*

पत्युरीश्वरस्य प्रधानपुरुषयोरधिष्ठातृत्वेन जगत्कारणत्वं नोपपद्यते कस्मात् असामञ्जस्यात्  
*The Lord, as the ruler of Prakṛti and Puruṣa, cannot be the cause of the world. Why? Because of inconsistency.*

किं पुनरसामञ्जस्यम् हीनमध्यमोत्तमभावेन हि प्राणिभेदान्विदधत ईश्वरस्य रागद्वेषादिदोषप्रसक्तेः अस्मदादिवदनीश्वरत्वं प्रसज्येत।  
*What is the inconsistency? By creating distinctions among beings as inferior, middling, and superior, the Lord would be subject to faults like attachment and aversion, and thus would become non-lordly, like us.*

प्राणिकर्मापेक्षितत्वाददोष इति चेत् न कर्मेश्वरयोः प्रवर्त्यप्रवर्तयितृत्वे इतरेतराश्रयदोषप्रसङ्गात्।  
*If it is argued that there is no fault because the Lord depends on the actions of beings, this is not valid, as it would lead to the fault of mutual dependence between actions and the Lord.*

न अनादित्वात् इति चेत् न वर्तमानकालवदतीतेष्वपि कालेष्वितरेतराश्रयदोषाविशेषादन्धपरंपरान्यायापत्तेः।  
*If it is argued that there is no beginning, this is also not valid, as it would lead to the same fault of mutual dependence in past times, resulting in an infinite regress.*

अपि च प्रवर्तनालक्षणा दोषाः इति न्यायवित्समयः न हि कश्चिददोषप्रयुक्तः स्वार्थे परार्थे वा प्रवर्तमानो दृश्यते स्वार्थप्रयुक्त एव च सर्वो जनः परार्थेऽपि प्रवर्तत इत्येवमप्यसामञ्जस्यम्  
*Moreover, according to the principles of logic, faults such as partiality are inherent in the act of creation. No one is seen to act without fault, whether for their own sake or for the sake of others. Everyone acts for their own sake, even when acting for others. Thus, there is inconsistency.*

स्वार्थवत्त्वादीश्वरस्यानीश्वरत्वप्रसङ्गात्।  
*Because of self-interest, the Lord would become non-lordly.*

पुरुषविशेषत्वाभ्युपगमाच्चेश्वरस्य पुरुषस्य चौदासीन्याभ्युपगमादसामञ्जस्यम्।  
*Because of the acceptance of the Lord as a special person and the acceptance of the indifference of Puruṣa, there is inconsistency.*

The Vedanta says that the Lord is both the efficient and the material cause of the world. The Naiyayikas, Vaiseshikas, Yogins, and Maheswaras say that the Lord is the efficient cause only, and the material cause is either the atoms according to the Naiyayikas and Vaiseshikas, or the Pradhana according to the Yogins and others. He is the ruler of the Pradhana and the souls, which are different from Him. Such a view leads to inconsistency. How ? Because it makes the Lord partial to some and prejudiced against others, for some people are well off in this world, while others are miserable. The opponents here may say : How does the Vedantin get out of the difficulty ? He replies: The Lord is impartial, but He directs the individuals according to their merit and demerit earned in previous existences. (See Sutras 2. I. 84-35). For the scriptures say so, and if you accept scriptural authority in this, you will have to accept its statement, “I will be many” etc. (Taitt. 2. 6), which shows that the Lord is both the efficient and the material cause.
