Πρῶτον οὖν θεωρητέον ἐκ τίνων ἡ μέθοδος. Εἰ δὴ λάβοιμεν
πρὸς πόσα καὶ ποῖα καὶ ἐκ τίνων οἱ λόγοι, καὶ πῶς τούτων
εὐπορήσομεν, ἔχοιμεν ἂν ἱκανῶς τὸ προκείμενον. Ἔστι
δ ἀριθμῷ ἴσα καὶ ταὐτά, ἐξ ὧν τε οἱ λόγοι καὶ περὶ ὧν οἱ
συλλογισμοί. Γίνονται μὲν γὰρ οἱ λόγοι ἐκ τῶν προτάσεων·
περὶ ὧν δὲ οἱ συλλογισμοί, τὰ προβλήματά ἐστι.
Πᾶσα δὲ πρότασις καὶ πᾶν πρόβλημα ἢ γένος ἢ ἴδιον ἢ
συμβεβηκὸς δηλοῖ· καὶ γὰρ τὴν διαφορὰν ὡς οὖσαν γενικὴν
ὁμοῦ τῷ γένει τακτέον. Ἐπεὶ δὲ τοῦ ἰδίου τὸ μὲν τὸ τί
ἦν εἶναι σημαίνει, τὸ δ οὐ σημαίνει, διῃρήσθω τὸ ἴδιον εἰς

261
ἄμφω τὰ προειρημένα μέρη, καὶ καλείσθω τὸ μὲν τὸ τί ἦν
εἶναι σημαῖνον ὅρος, τὸ δὲ λοιπὸν κατὰ τὴν κοινὴν περὶ αὐτῶν
ἀποδοθεῖσαν ὀνομασίαν προσαγορευέσθω ἴδιον. Δῆλον
οὖν ἐκ τῶν εἰρημένων ὅτι κατὰ τὴν νῦν διαίρεσιν τέτταρα
τὰ πάντα συμβαίνει γίνεσθαι, ἢ ἴδιον ἢ ὅρον ἢ γένος ἢ συμβεβηκός.
Μηδεὶς δ ἡμᾶς ὑπολάβῃ λέγειν ὡς ἕκαστον τούτων
καθ αὑτὸ λεγόμενον πρότασις ἢ πρόβλημά ἐστιν, ἀλλ
ὅτι ἀπὸ τούτων καὶ τὰ προβλήματα καὶ αἱ προτάσεις γίνονται.
Διαφέρει δὲ τὸ πρόβλημα καὶ ἡ πρότασις τῷ τρόπῳ.
Οὕτω μὲν γὰρ ῥηθέντος, ἆρά γε τὸ ζῷον πεζὸν δίπουν
ὁρισμός ἐστιν ἀνθρώπου; καὶ ἆρά γε τὸ ζῷον γένος ἐστὶ
τοῦ ἀνθρώπου; πρότασις γίνεται. Ἐὰν δέ, πότερον τὸ
ζῷον πεζὸν δίπουν ὁρισμός ἐστιν ἀνθρώπου ἢ οὔ; καὶ πότερον
τὸ ζῷον γένος ἐστίν; πρόβλημα γίνεται. Ὁμοίως
δὲ καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν ἄλλων. Ὅστ εἰκότως ἴσα τῷ ἀριθμῷ τὰ
προβλήματα καὶ αἱ προτάσεις εἰσίν. Ἀπὸ πάσης γὰρ προτάσεως
πρόβλημα ποιήσεις μεταβάλλων τῷ τρόπῳ.

First, then, we must see of what parts our inquiry consists. Now if we were to grasp (a) with reference to how many, and what kind of, things arguments take place, and with what materials they start, and (h) how we are to become well supplied with these, we should have sufficiently won our goal. Now the materials with which arguments start are equal in number, and are identical, with the subjects on which reasonings take place. For arguments start with 'propositions', while the subjects on which reasonings take place are 'problems'. Now every proposition and every problem indicates either a genus or a peculiarity or an accident-for the differentia too, applying as it does to a class (or genus), should be ranked together with the genus. Since, however, of what is peculiar to anything part signifies its essence, while part does not, let us divide the 'peculiar' into both the aforesaid parts, and call that part which indicates the essence a 'definition', while of the remainder let us adopt the terminology which is generally current about these things, and speak of it as a 'property'. What we have said, then, makes it clear that according to our present division, the elements turn out to be four, all told, namely either property or definition or genus or accident. Do not let any one suppose us to mean that each of these enunciated by itself constitutes a proposition or problem, but only that it is from these that both problems and propositions are formed. The difference between a problem and a proposition is a difference in the turn of the phrase. For if it be put in this way, "'An animal that walks on two feet" is the definition of man, is it not?' or '"Animal" is the genus of man, is it not?' the result is a proposition: but if thus, 'Is "an animal that walks on two feet" a definition of man or no?' [or 'Is "animal" his genus or no?'] the result is a problem. Similarly too in other cases. Naturally, then, problems and propositions are equal in number: for out of every proposition you will make a problem if you change the turn of the phrase.

Λεκτέον δὲ τί ὅρος, τί ἴδιον, τί γένος, τί συμβεβηκός.
Ἔστι δ ὅρος μὲν λόγος ὁ τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι σημαίνων. Ἀποδίδοται
δὲ ἢ λόγος ἀντ ὀνόματος ἢ λόγος ἀντὶ λόγου· δυνατὸν
γὰρ καὶ τῶν ὑπὸ λόγου τινὰ σημαινομένων ὁρίσασθαι.
Ὅσοι δ ὁπωσοῦν ὀνόματι τὴν ἀπόδοσιν ποιοῦνται, δῆλον ὡς
οὐκ ἀποδιδόασιν οὗτοι τὸν τοῦ πράγματος ὁρισμόν, ἐπειδὴ
πᾶς ὁρισμὸς λόγος τίς ἐστιν. Ὁρικὸν μέντοι καὶ τὸ τοιοῦτον
θετέον, οἷον ὅτι καλόν ἐστι τὸ πρέπον. Ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ
τὸ πότερον ταὐτὸν αἴσθησις καὶ ἐπιστήμη ἢ ἕτερον· καὶ
γὰρ περὶ τοὺς ὁρισμούς, πότερον ταὐτὸν ἢ ἕτερον, ἡ πλείστη
γίνεται διατριβή. Ἁπλῶς δὲ ὁρικὰ πάντα λεγέσθω τὰ ὑπὸ
τὴν αὐτὴν ὄντα μέθοδον τοῖς ὁρισμοῖς. Ὅτι δὲ πάντα τὰ
νῦν ῥηθέντα τοιαῦτ ἐστί, δῆλον ἐξ αὐτῶν. Δυνάμενοι γὰρ

262
ὅτι ταὐτὸν καὶ ὅτι ἕτερον διαλέγεσθαι, τῷ αὐτῷ τρόπῳ καὶ
πρὸς τοὺς ὁρισμοὺς ἐπιχειρεῖν εὐπορήσομεν· δείξαντες γὰρ
ὅτι οὐ ταὐτόν ἐστιν ἀνῃρηκότες ἐσόμεθα τὸν ὁρισμόν. Οὐ
μὴν ἀντιστρέφει γε τὸ νῦν ῥηθέν· οὐ γὰρ ἱκανὸν πρὸς τὸ
κατασκευάσαι τὸν ὁρισμὸν τὸ δεῖξαι ταὐτὸν ὄν. Πρὸς μέντοι
τὸ ἀνασκευάσαι αὔταρκες τὸ δεῖξαι ὅτι οὐ ταὐτόν.
Ἴδιον δ ἐστὶν ὃ μὴ δηλοῖ μὲν τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι, μόνῳ δ ὑπάρχει
καὶ ἀντικατηγορεῖται τοῦ πράγματος, οἷον ἴδιον ἀνθρώπου
τὸ γραμματικῆς εἶναι δεκτικόν· εἰ γὰρ ἄνθρωπός ἐστι,
γραμματικῆς δεκτικός ἐστι, καὶ εἰ γραμματικῆς δεκτικός
ἐστιν, ἄνθρωπός ἐστιν. Οὐθεὶς γὰρ ἴδιον λέγει τὸ ἐνδεχόμενον
ἄλλῳ ὑπάρχειν, οἷον τὸ καθεύδειν ἀνθρώπῳ, οὐδ ἂν
τύχῃ κατά τινα χρόνον μόνῳ ὑπάρχον. Εἰ δ ἄρα τι καὶ
λέγοιτο τῶν τοιούτων ἴδιον, οὐχ ἁπλῶς ἀλλὰ ποτὲ ἢ πρός
τι ἴδιον ῥηθήσεται· τὸ μὲν γὰρ ἐκ δεξιῶν εἶναι ποτὲ ἴδιόν
ἐστι, τὸ δὲ δίπουν πρός τι ἴδιον τυγχάνει λεγόμενον, οἷον
τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ πρὸς ἵππον καὶ κύνα. Ὅτι δὲ τῶν ἐνδεχομένων
ἄλλῳ ὑπάρχειν οὐθὲν ἀντικατηγορεῖται, δῆλον· οὐ γὰρ
ἀναγκαῖον, εἴ τι καθεύδει, ἄνθρωπον εἶναι.

Γένος δ ἐστὶ τὸ κατὰ πλειόνων καὶ διαφερόντων τῷ εἴδει
ἐν τῷ τί ἐστι κατηγορούμενον. Ἐν τῷ τί ἐστι δὲ κατηγορεῖσθαι
τὰ τοιαῦτα λεγέσθω, ὅσα ἁρμόττει ἀποδοῦναι ἐρωτηθέντας
τί ἐστι τὸ προκείμενον, καθάπερ ἐπὶ τοῦ ἀνθρώπου
ἁρμόττει, ἐρωτηθέντα τί ἐστι τὸ προκείμενον, εἰπεῖν ὅτι
ζῷον. Γενικὸν δὲ καὶ τὸ πότερον ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ γένει ἄλλο
ἄλλῳ ἢ ἐν ἑτέρῳ. Καὶ γὰρ τὸ τοιοῦτον ὑπὸ τὴν αὐτὴν μέθοδον
πίπτει τῷ γένει· διαλεχθέντες γὰρ ὅτι τὸ ζῷον
γένος τοῦ ἀνθρώπου, ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ τοῦ βοός, διειλεγμένοι
ἐσόμεθα ὅτι ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ γένει. Ἐὰν δὲ τοῦ μὲν ἑτέρου

263
δείξωμεν ὅτι γένος ἐστί, τοῦ δὲ ἑτέρου ὅτι οὐκ ἔστι, διειλεγμένοι
ἐσόμεθα ὅτι οὐκ ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ γένει ταῦτ ἐστίν.
Συμβεβηκὸς δέ ἐστιν ὃ μηδὲν μὲν τούτων ἐστί, μήτε ὅρος
μήτε ἴδιον μήτε γένος, ὑπάρχει δὲ τῷ πράγματι, καὶ ὃ ἐνδέχεται
ὑπάρχειν ὁτῳοῦν ἑνὶ καὶ τῷ αὐτῷ καὶ μὴ ὑπάρχειν, οἷον
τὸ καθῆσθαι ἐνδέχεται ὑπάρχειν τινὶ τῷ αὐτῷ καὶ μὴ ὑπάρχειν.
Ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ τὸ λευκόν· τὸ γὰρ αὐτὸ οὐθὲν κωλύει
ὁτὲ μὲν λευκὸν ὁτὲ δὲ μὴ λευκὸν εἶναι. Ἔστι δὲ τῶν τοῦ
συμβεβηκότος ὁρισμῶν ὁ δεύτερος βελτίων· τοῦ μὲν γὰρ
πρώτου ῥηθέντος ἀναγκαῖον, εἰ μέλλει τις συνήσειν, προειδέναι
τί ἐστιν ὅρος καὶ γένος καὶ ἴδιον, ὁ δὲ δεύτερος αὐτοτελής
ἐστι πρὸς τὸ γνωρίζειν τί ποτ ἐστὶ τὸ λεγόμενον καθ
αὑτό. Προσκείσθωσαν δὲ τῷ συμβεβηκότι καὶ αἱ πρὸς ἄλληλα
συγκρίσεις, ὁπωσοῦν ἀπὸ τοῦ συμβεβηκότος λεγόμεναι,
οἷον πότερον τὸ καλὸν ἢ τὸ συμφέρον αἱρετώτερον, καὶ πότερον
ὁ κατ ἀρετὴν ἢ ὁ κατ ἀπόλαυσιν ἡδίων βίος, καὶ εἴ τι
ἄλλο παραπλησίως τυγχάνει τούτοις λεγόμενον· ἐπὶ πάντων
γὰρ τῶν τοιούτων, ποτέρῳ μᾶλλον τὸ κατηγορούμενον
συμβέβηκεν, ἡ ζήτησις γίνεται. Δῆλον δ ἐξ αὐτῶν ὅτι τὸ
συμβεβηκὸς οὐθὲν κωλύει ποτὲ καὶ πρός τι ἴδιον γίνεσθαι,
οἷον τὸ καθῆσθαι συμβεβηκὸς ὄν, ὅταν τις μόνος κάθηται,
τότε ἴδιον ἔσται, μὴ μόνου δὲ καθημένου πρὸς τοὺς μὴ καθημένους
ἴδιον. Ὥστε καὶ πρός τι καὶ ποτὲ οὐθὲν κωλύει
τὸ συμβεβηκὸς ἴδιον γίνεσθαι. Ἁπλῶς δ ἴδιον οὐκ ἔσται.

We must now say what are 'definition', 'property', 'genus', and 'accident'. A 'definition' is a phrase signifying a thing's essence. It is rendered in the form either of a phrase in lieu of a term, or of a phrase in lieu of another phrase; for it is sometimes possible to define the meaning of a phrase as well. People whose rendering consists of a term only, try it as they may, clearly do not render the definition of the thing in question, because a definition is always a phrase of a certain kind. One may, however, use the word 'definitory' also of such a remark as 'The "becoming" is "beautiful"', and likewise also of the question, 'Are sensation and knowledge the same or different?', for argument about definitions is mostly concerned with questions of sameness and difference. In a word we may call 'definitory' everything that falls under the same branch of inquiry as definitions; and that all the above-mentioned examples are of this character is clear on the face of them. For if we are able to argue that two things are the same or are different, we shall be well supplied by the same turn of argument with lines of attack upon their definitions as well: for when we have shown that they are not the same we shall have demolished the definition. Observe, please, that the converse of this last statement does not hold: for to show that they are the same is not enough to establish a definition. To show, however, that they are not the same is enough of itself to overthrow it.

A 'property' is a predicate which does not indicate the essence of a thing, but yet belongs to that thing alone, and is predicated convertibly of it. Thus it is a property of man to-be-capable of learning grammar: for if A be a man, then he is capable of learning grammar, and if he be capable of learning grammar, he is a man. For no one calls anything a 'property' which may possibly belong to something else, e.g. 'sleep' in the case of man, even though at a certain time it may happen to belong to him alone. That is to say, if any such thing were actually to be called a property, it will be called not a 'property' absolutely, but a 'temporary' or a 'relative' property: for 'being on the right hand side' is a temporary property, while 'two-footed' is in point of fact ascribed as a property in certain relations; e.g. it is a property of man relatively to a horse and a dog. That nothing which may belong to anything else than A is a convertible predicate of A is clear: for it does not necessarily follow that if something is asleep it is a man.

A 'genus' is what is predicated in the category of essence of a number of things exhibiting differences in kind. We should treat as predicates in the category of essence all such things as it would be appropriate to mention in reply to the question, 'What is the object before you?'; as, for example, in the case of man, if asked that question, it is appropriate to say 'He is an animal'. The question, 'Is one thing in the same genus as another or in a different one?' is also a 'generic' question; for a question of that kind as well falls under the same branch of inquiry as the genus: for having argued that 'animal' is the genus of man, and likewise also of ox, we shall have argued that they are in the same genus; whereas if we show that it is the genus of the one but not of the other, we shall have argued that these things are not in the same genus.

An 'accident' is (i) something which, though it is none of the foregoing-i.e. neither a definition nor a property nor a genus yet belongs to the thing: (something which may possibly either belong or not belong to any one and the self-same thing, as (e.g.) the 'sitting posture' may belong or not belong to some self-same thing. Likewise also 'whiteness', for there is nothing to prevent the same thing being at one time white, and at another not white. Of the definitions of accident the second is the better: for if he adopts the first, any one is bound, if he is to understand it, to know already what 'definition' and 'genus' and 'property' are, whereas the second is sufficient of itself to tell us the essential meaning of the term in question. To Accident are to be attached also all comparisons of things together, when expressed in language that is drawn in any kind of way from what happens (accidit) to be true of them; such as, for example, the question, 'Is the honourable or the expedient preferable?' and 'Is the life of virtue or the life of self-indulgence the pleasanter?', and any other problem which may happen to be phrased in terms like these. For in all such cases the question is 'to which of the two does the predicate in question happen (accidit) to belong more closely?' It is clear on the face of it that there is nothing to prevent an accident from becoming a temporary or relative property. Thus the sitting posture is an accident, but will be a temporary property, whenever a man is the only person sitting, while if he be not the only one sitting, it is still a property relatively to those who are not sitting. So then, there is nothing to prevent an accident from becoming both a relative and a temporary property; but a property absolutely it will never be.
