Τὸ τῆς φιλοσοφίας ἔργον ἔνιοί φασιν ἀπὸ βαρβάρων ἄρξαι. 

There are some who say that the study of philosophy had its beginning among the barbarians. 

γεγενῆσθαι γὰρ παρὰ μὲν Πέρσαις Μάγους, παρὰ δὲ Βαβυλωνίοις ἢ Ἀσσυρίοις Χαλδαίους, καὶ Γυμνοσοφιστὰς παρ᾽ Ἰνδοῖς, 

They urge that the Persians have had their Magi, the Babylonians or Assyrians their Chaldaeans, and the Indians their Gymnosophists; 

παρά τε Κελτοῖς καὶ Γαλάταις τοὺς καλουμένους Δρυΐδας καὶ Σεμνοθέους, 

and among the Celts and Gauls there are the people called Druids or Holy Ones, 

καθά φησιν Ἀριστοτέλης ἐν τῷ Μαγικῷ καὶ Σωτίων ἐν τῷ εἰκοστῷ τρίτῳ τῆς Διαδοχῆς. 

for which they cite as authorities the Magicus of Aristotle and Sotion in the twenty-third1 book of his Succession of Philosophers. 

Φοίνικά τε γενέσθαι Μῶχον, καὶ Θρᾷκα Ζάμολξιν, καὶ Λίβυν Ἄτλαντα.

Also they say that Mochus was a Phoenician, Zamolxis a Thracian, and Atlas a Libyan.

Αἰγύπτιοι μὲν γὰρ Νείλου γενέσθαι παῖδα Ἥφαιστον, ὃν ἄρξαι φιλοσοφίας, ἧς τοὺς προεστῶτας ἱερέας εἶναι καὶ προφήτας. 

[2] If we may believe the Egyptians, Hephaestus was the son of the Nile, and with him philosophy began, priests and prophets being its chief exponents.

2 [2] ἀπὸ δὲ τούτου εἰς Ἀλέξανδρον τὸν Μακεδόνα ἐτῶν εἶναι μυριάδας τέσσαρας καὶ ὀκτακισχίλια ὀκτακόσια ἑξήκοντα τρία: ἐν οἷς ἡλίου μὲν ἐκλείψεις γενέσθαι τριακοσίας ἑβδομήκοντα τρεῖς, σελήνης δὲ ὀκτακοσίας τριάκοντα δύο.

Hephaestus lived 48,863 years before Alexander of Macedon, and in the interval there occurred 373 solar and 832 lunar eclipses.

Ἀπὸ δὲ τῶν Μάγων, ὧν ἄρξαι Ζωροάστρην τὸν Πέρσην, Ἑρμόδωρος μὲν ὁ Πλατωνικὸς ἐν τῷ Περὶ μαθημάτων φησὶν εἰς τὴν Τροίας ἅλωσιν ἔτη γεγονέναι πεντακισχίλια: 

The date of the Magians, beginning with Zoroaster the Persian, was 5000 years before the fall of Troy, as given by Hermodorus the Platonist in his work on mathematics; 

Ξάνθος δὲ ὁ Λυδὸς εἰς τὴν Ξέρξου διάβασιν ἀπὸ τοῦ Ζωροάστρου ἑξακισχίλιά φησι, καὶ μετ᾽ αὐτὸν γεγονέναι πολλούς τινας Μάγους κατὰ διαδοχήν, Ὀστάνας καὶ Ἀστραμψύχους καὶ Γωβρύας καὶ Παζάτας, μέχρι τῆς τῶν Περσῶν ὑπ᾽ Ἀλεξάνδρου καταλύσεως.

but Xanthus the Lydian reckons 6000 years from Zoroaster to the expedition of Xerxes, and after that event he places a long line of Magians in succession, bearing the names of Ostanas, Astrampsychos, Gobryas, and Pazatas, down to the conquest of Persia by Alexander.

Λανθάνουσι δ᾽ αὑτοὺς τὰ τῶν Ἑλλήνων κατορθώματα, ἀφ᾽ ὧν μὴ ὅτι γε φιλοσοφία, ἀλλὰ καὶ γένος ἀνθρώπων ἦρξε, βαρβάροις προσάπτοντες. 

These authors forget that the achievements which they attribute to the barbarians belong to the Greeks, with whom not merely philosophy but the human race itself began. 

ἰδοὺ γοῦν παρὰ μὲν Ἀθηναίοις γέγονε Μουσαῖος, παρὰ δὲ Θηβαίοις Λίνος. 

For instance, Musaeus is claimed by Athens, Linus by Thebes. 

καὶ τὸν μὲν Εὐμόλπου παῖδά φασι, ποιῆσαι δὲ Θεογονίαν καὶ Σφαῖραν πρῶτον: φάναι τε ἐξ ἑνὸς τὰ πάντα γίνεσθαι καὶ εἰς ταὐτὸν ἀναλύεσθαι. 

It is said that the former, the son of Eumolpus, was the first to compose a genealogy of the gods and to construct a sphere, and that he maintained that all things proceed from unity and are resolved again into unity. 

τοῦτον τελευτῆσαι Φαληροῖ, καὶ αὐτῷ ἐπιγεγράφθαι τόδε τὸ ἐλεγεῖον:

He died at Phalerum, and this is his epitaph2:

Εὐμόλπου φίλον υἱὸν ἔχει τὸ Φαληρικὸν οὖδας,
Μουσαῖον, φθιμένου σῶμ᾽, ὑπὸ τῷδε τάφῳ.

Musaeus, to his sire Eumolpus dear,
In Phalerean soil lies buried here;

ἀπὸ δὲ τοῦ πατρὸς τοῦ Μουσαίου καὶ Εὐμολπίδαι καλοῦνται παρ᾽ Ἀθηναίοις.

and the Eumolpidae at Athens get their name from the father of Musaeus.

Τὸν δὲ Λίνον παῖδα εἶναι Ἑρμοῦ καὶ Μούσης Οὐρανίας: ποιῆσαι δὲ κοσμογονίαν, ἡλίου καὶ σελήνης πορείαν, καὶ ζῴων καὶ καρπῶν γενέσεις. τούτῳ ἀρχὴ τῶν ποιημάτων ἥδε:

Linus again was (so it is said) the son of Hermes and the Muse Urania. He composed a poem describing the creation of the world, the courses of the sun and moon, and the growth of animals and plants. His poem begins with the line:

ἦν ποτέ τοι χρόνος οὗτος, ἐν ᾧ ἅμα πάντ᾽ ἐπεφύκει.

Time was when all things grew up at once;

ὅθεν λαβὼν Ἀναξαγόρας πάντα ἔφη χρήματα

γεγονέναι ὁμοῦ, νοῦν δὲ ἐλθόντα αὐτὰ διακοσμῆσαι. τὸν δὲ Λίνον τελευτῆσαι ἐν Εὐβοίᾳ τοξευθέντα ὑπ᾽ Ἀπόλλωνος, καὶ αὐτῷ ἐπιγεγράφθαι:

and this idea was borrowed by Anaxagoras when he declared that all things were originally together until Mind came and set them in order. Linus died in Euboea, slain by the arrow of Apollo, and this is his epitaph3:

ἥδε5 Λίνον Θηβαῖον ἐδέξατο γαῖα θανόντα,

Here Theban Linus, whom Urania bore,

Μούσης Οὐρανίης υἱὸν ἐϋστεφάνου.

The fair-crowned Muse, sleeps on a foreign shore.

καὶ ὧδε μὲν ἀφ᾽ Ἑλλήνων ἦρξε φιλοσοφία, ἧς καὶ αὐτὸ τὸ ὄνομα τὴν βάρβαρον ἀπέστραπται προσηγορίαν.

And thus it was from the Greeks that philosophy took its rise: its very name refuses to be translated into foreign speech.

Hermippus in his work On the Sages reckons seventeen, from which number different people make different selections of seven. They are: Solon, Thales, Pittacus, Bias, Chilon, Myson, Cleobulus, Periander, Ana- charsis, Acusilaus, Epimenides, Leophantus, Pherecydes, Aristodemus, Pythagoras, Lasos, son of Charmantides or Sisymbrinus, or, according to Aristoxenus, of Chabrinus, born at Hermione, Anaxagoras. Hippobotus in his List of Philosophers enumerates: Orpheus, Linus, Solon, Periander, Anacharsis, Cleobulus, Myson, Thales, Bias, Pittacus, Epicharmus, Pythagoras.

[109] Ἐπιμενίδης, καθά φησι Θεόπομπος καὶ ἄλλοι συχνοί, πατρὸς μὲν ἦν Φαιστίου, οἱ δὲ Δωσιάδα οἱ δὲ Ἀγησάρχου: Κρὴς τὸ γένος ἀπὸ Κνωσοῦ, καθέσει τῆς κόμης τὸ εἶδος παραλλάσσων. οὗτός ποτε πεμφθεὶς παρὰ τοῦ πατρὸς εἰς ἀγρὸν ἐπὶ πρόβατον, τῆς ὁδοῦ κατὰ μεσημβρίαν ἐκκλίνας ὑπ᾽ ἄντρῳ τινὶ κατεκοιμήθη ἑπτὰ καὶ πεντήκοντα ἔτη. διαναστὰς δὲ μετὰ ταῦτα ἐζήτει τὸ πρόβατον, νομίζων ἐπ᾽ ὀλίγον κεκοιμῆσθαι. ὡς δὲ οὐχ εὕρισκε, παρεγένετο εἰς τὸν ἀγρόν, καὶ μετεσκευασμένα πάντα καταλαβὼν καὶ παρ᾽ ἑτέρῳ τὴν κτῆσιν, πάλιν ἧκεν εἰς ἄστυ διαπορούμενος. κἀκεῖ δὲ εἰς τὴν ἑαυτοῦ εἰσιὼν οἰκίαν περιέτυχε τοῖς πυνθανομένοις τίς εἴη, ἕως τὸν νεώτερον ἀδελφὸν εὑρὼν τότε ἤδη γέροντα ὄντα, πᾶσαν ἔμαθε παρ᾽ ἐκείνου τὴν ἀλήθειαν. 2

EPIMENIDES (c. 600 B.C.)
[109] Epimenides, according to Theopompus and many other writers, was the son of Phaestius; some, however, make him the son of Dosiadas, others of Agesarchus. He was a native of Cnossos in Crete, though from wearing his hair long he did not look like a Cretan. One day he was sent into the country by his father to look for a stray sheep, and at noon he turned aside out of the way, and went to sleep in a cave, where he slept for fifty-seven years. After this he got up and went in search of the sheep, thinking he had been asleep only a short time. And when he could not find it, he came to the farm, and found everything changed and another owner in possession. Then he went back to the town in utter perplexity; and there, on entering his own house, he fell in with people who wanted to know who he was. At length he found his younger brother, now an old man, and learnt the truth from him. 

### 110
[110] γνωσθεὶς δὲ παρὰ τοῖς Ἕλλησι θεοφιλέστατος εἶναι ὑπελήφθη.

So he became famous throughout Greece, and was believed to be a special favourite of heaven.

Τότε καὶ Ἀθηναίοις [τότε] λοιμῷ κατεχομένοις ἔχρησεν ἡ Πυθία καθῆραι τὴν πόλιν: 

Hence, when the Athenians were attacked by pestilence, and the Pythian priestess bade them purify the city, 

οἱ δὲ πέμπουσι ναῦν τε καὶ Νικίαν τὸν Νικηράτου εἰς Κρήτην, καλοῦντες τὸν Ἐπιμενίδην. 

they sent a ship commanded by Nicias, son of Niceratus, to Crete to ask the help of Epimenides. 

καὶ ὃς ἐλθὼν Ὀλυμπιάδι τεσσαρακοστῇ ἕκτῇ ἐκάθηρεν αὐτῶν τὴν πόλιν καὶ ἔπαυσε τὸν λοιμὸν τοῦτον τὸν τρόπον. 

And he came in the 46th Olympiad,1 purified their city, and stopped the pestilence in the following way. 

λαβὼν πρόβατα μέλανά τε καὶ λευκὰ ἤγαγε πρὸς τὸν Ἄρειον πάγον: 

He took sheep, some black and others white, and brought them to the Areopagus; 

κἀκεῖθεν εἴασεν ἰέναι οἷ βούλοιντο, προστάξας τοῖς ἀκολούθοις ἔνθα ἂν κατακλίνοι αὐτῶν ἕκαστον, θύειν τῷ προσήκοντι θεῷ: 

and there he let them go whither they pleased, instructing those who followed them to mark the spot where each sheep lay down and offer a sacrifice to the local divinity. 

καὶ οὕτω λῆξαι τὸ κακόν. 

And thus, it is said, the plague was stayed. 

ὅθεν ἔτι καὶ νῦν ἔστιν εὑρεῖν κατὰ τοὺς δήμους τῶν Ἀθηναίωι βωμοὺς ἀνωνύμους, ὑπόμνημα τῆς τότε γενομένης ἐξιλάσεως. 

Hence even to this day altars may be found in different parts of Attica with no name inscribed upon them, which are memorials of this atonement. 

οἱ δὲ τὴν αἰτίαν εἰπεῖν τοῦ λοιμοῦ τὸ Κυλώνειον ἄγος σημαίνειν τε τὴν ἀπαλλαγήν: 

According to some writers he declared the plague to have been caused by the pollution which Cylon brought on the city and showed them how to remove it. 

καὶ διὰ τοῦτο ἀποθανεῖν δύο νεανίας, Κρατῖνον καὶ Κτησίβιον, καὶ λυθῆναι τὴν συμφοράν.

In consequence two young men, Cratinus and Ctesibius, were put to death and the city was delivered from the scourge.
### 111
Ἀθηναῖοι δὲ τάλαντον ἐψηφίσαντο δοῦναι αὐτῷ καὶ ναῦν τὴν ἐς Κρήτην ἀπάξουσαν αὐτόν. ὁ δὲ τὸ μὲν ἀργύριον οὐ προσήκατο: φιλίαν δὲ καὶ συμμαχίαν ἐποιήσατο Κνωσίων καὶ Ἀθηναίων.

The Athenians voted him a talent in money and a ship to convey him back to Crete. The money he declined, but he concluded a treaty of friendship and alliance between Cnossos and Athens.

Καὶ ἐπανελθὼν ἐπ᾽ οἴκου μετ᾽ οὐ πολὺ μετήλλαξεν, ὥς φησι Φλέγων ἐν τῷ Περὶ μακροβίων, βιοὺς ἔτη ἑπτὰ καὶ πεντήκοντα καὶ ἑκατόν: ὡς δὲ Κρῆτες λέγουσιν, ἑνὸς δέοντα τριακόσια: ὡς δὲ Ξενοφάνης ὁ Κολοφώνιος ἀκηκοέναι φησί, τέτταρα πρὸς τοῖς πεντήκοντα καὶ ἑκατόν.

So he returned home and soon afterwards died. According to Phlegon in his work On Longevity he lived one hundred and fifty-seven years; according to the Cretans two hundred and ninety-nine years. Xenophanes of Colophon gives his age as 154, according to hearsay.

Ἐποίησε δὲ Κουρήτων καὶ Κορυβάντων γένεσιν καὶ Θεογονίαν, ἔπη πεντακισχίλια, Ἀργοῦς ναυπηγίαν τε καὶ Ἰάσονος εἰς Κόλχους ἀπόπλουν 4

He wrote a poem On the Birth of the Curetes and Corybantes and a Theogony,2 5000 lines in all; another on the building of the Argo and Jason's voyage to Colchis in 6500 lines.

### 112
ἔπη ἑξακισχίλια πεντακόσια. συνέγραψε δὲ καὶ καταλογάδην Περὶ θυσιῶν καὶ τῆς ἐν Κρήτῃ πολιτείας καὶ Περὶ Μίνω καὶ Ῥαδαμάνθυος εἰς ἔπη τετρακισχίλια. ἱδρύσατο δὲ καὶ παρ᾽ Ἀθηναίοις τὸ ἱερὸν τῶν Σεμνῶν, ὥς φησι Λόβων ὁ Ἀργεῖος ἐν τῷ Περὶ ποιητῶν. λέγεται δὲ καὶ πρῶτος οἰκίας καὶ ἀγροὺς καθῆραι καὶ ἱερὰ ἱδρύσασθαι. εἰσὶ δ᾽ οἳ μὴ κοιμηθῆναι αὐτὸν λέγουσιν, ἀλλὰ χρόνον τινὰ ἐκπατῆσαι ἀσχολούμενον περὶ ῥιζοτομίαν.

He also compiled prose works On Sacrifices and the Cretan Constitution, also On Minos and Rhadamanthus, running to about 4000 lines. At Athens again he founded the temple of the Eumenides, as Lobon of Argos tells us in his work On Poets. He is stated to have been the first who purified houses and fields, and the first who founded temples. Some are found to maintain that he did not go to sleep but withdrew himself3 for a while, engaged in gathering simples.

Φέρεται δ᾽ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπιστολὴ πρὸς Σόλωνα τὸν νομοθέτην, περιέχουσα πολιτείαν ἣν διέταξε Κρησὶ Μίνως. ἀλλὰ Δημήτριος ὁ Μάγνης ἐν τοῖς περὶ ὁμωνύμων ποιητῶν τε καὶ συγγραφέων διελέγχειν πειρᾶται τὴν ἐπιστολὴν ὡς νεαρὰν καὶ μὴ τῇ Κρητικῇ φωνῇ γεγραμμένην, Ἀτθίδι δὲ καὶ ταύτῃ νέᾳ. ἐγὼ δὲ καὶ ἄλλην εὗρον ἐπιστολὴν ἔχουσαν οὕτως:

There is extant a letter of his to Solon the lawgiver, containing a scheme of government which Minos drew up for the Cretans. But Demetrius of Magnesia, in his work on poets and writers of the same name, endeavours to discredit the letter on the ground that it is late and not written in the Cretan dialect but in Attic, and New Attic too. However, I have found another letter by him which runs as follows:

### 113
Ἐπιμενίδης Σόλωνι
5 [113] "Θάρρει, ὦ ἑταῖρε. αἰ γὰρ ἔτι θητευόντεσσιν Ἀθηναίοις καὶ μὴ εὐνομημένοις ἐπεθήκατο Πεισίστρατος, εἶχέ κα τὰν ἀρχὰν ἀεί, ἀνδραποδιξάμενος τὼς πολιήτας: νῦν δὲ οὐ κακὼς ἄνδρας δουλῶται: τοὶ μεμναμένοι τᾶς Σόλωνος μανύσιος ἀλγιόντι πεδ᾽ αἰσχύνας οὐδὲ ἀνεξοῦνται τυραννούμενοι. ἀλλ᾽ αἴ κα Πεισίστρατος <αὐτὸς> κατασχέθῃ τὰν πόλιν, οὐ μὰν ἐς παῖδάς γε τήνω ἔλπομαι τὸ κράτος ἵξεσθαι: δυσμάχανον γὰρ ἀνθρώπως ἐλευθεριάξαντας ἐν τεθμοῖς ἀρίστοις δούλως ἦμεν. τὺ δὲ μὴ ἀλᾶσθαι, ἀλλ᾽ ἕρπε ἐς Κρήτην ποθ᾽ ἁμέ. τουτᾶ γὰρ οὐκ ἐσεῖταί τιν δεινὸς ὁ μόναρχος: αἰ δέ πη ἐπ᾽ ἀλατείᾳ ἐγκύρσωντί τοι τοὶ τήνω φίλοι, δειμαίνω μή τι δεινὸν πάθῃς.

Epimenides to Solon
[113] "Courage, my friend. For if Pisistratus had attacked the Athenians while they were still serfs and before they had good laws, he would have secured power in perpetuity by the enslavement of the citizens. But, as it is, he is reducing to subjection men who are no cowards, men who with pain and shame remember Solon's warning and will never endure to be under a tyrant. But even should Pisistratus himself hold down the city, I do not expect that his power will be continued to his children; for it is hard to contrive that men brought up as free men under the best laws should be slaves. But, instead of going on your travels, come quietly to Crete to me; for here you will have no monarch to fear, whereas, if some of his friends should fall in with you while you are travelling about, I fear you may come to some harm.'

### 114

This is the tenor of the letter. But Demetrius reports a story that he received from the Nymphs food of a special sort and kept it in a cow's hoof; that he took small doses of this food, which was entirely absorbed into his system, and he was never seen to eat. Timaeus mentions him in his second book. Some writers say that the Cretans sacrifice to him as a god; for they say that he had superhuman foresight. For instance, when he saw Munichia, at Athens, he said the Athenians did not know how many evils that place would bring upon them; for, if they did, they would destroy it even if they had to do so with their teeth. And this he said so long before the event. It is also stated that he was the first to call himself Aeacus; that he foretold to the Lacedaemonians their defeat by the Arcadians; and that he claimed that his soul had passed through many incarnations.

### 115
Theopompus relates in his Mirabilia that, as he was building a temple to the Nymphs, a voice came from heaven: "Epimenides, not a temple to the Nymphs but to Zeus," and that he foretold to the Cretans the defeat of the Lacedaemonians by the Arcadians, as already stated; and in very truth they were crushed at Orchomenus.

And he became old in as many days as he had slept years; for this too is stated by Theopompus. Myronianus in his Parallels declares that the Cretans called him one of the Curetes. The Lacedaemonians guard his body in their own keeping in obedience to a certain oracle; this is stated by Sosibius the Laconian.

There have been two other men named Epimenides, namely, the genealogist and another who wrote in Doric Greek about Rhodes.

### 116

[116] Φερεκύδης Βάβυος Σύριος, καθά φησιν Ἀλέξανδρος ἐν Διαδοχαῖς, Πιττακοῦ διακήκοεν. τοῦτόν
φησι Θεόπομπος πρῶτον περὶ φύσεως καὶ θεῶν γράψαι.

[116] Pherecydes, the son of Babys, and a native of Syros according to Alexander in his Successions of Philosophers, was a pupil of Pittacus. Theopompus tells us that he was the first who wrote in Greek on nature and the gods.

Πολλὰ δὲ καὶ θαυμάσια λέγεται περὶ αὐτοῦ. καὶ γὰρ παρὰ τὸν αἰγιαλὸν τῆς Σάμου περιπατοῦντα καὶ ναῦν οὐριοδρομοῦσαν ἰδόντα εἰπεῖν ὡς οὐ μετὰ πολὺ καταδύσεται: καὶ ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτοῦ καταδῦναι. καὶ ἀνιμηθέντος ἐκ φρέατος ὕδατος πιόντα προειπεῖν, ὡς εἰς τρίτην ἡμέραν ἔσοιτο σεισμός, καὶ γενέσθαι. ἀνιόντα τε ἐξ Ὀλυμπίας εἰς Μεσσήνην τῷ ξένῳ Περιλάῳ συμβουλεῦσαι ἐξοικῆσαι μετὰ τῶν οἰκείων: καὶ τὸν μὴ πεισθῆναι, Μεσσήνην δὲ ἑαλωκέναι.

Many wonderful stories are told about him. He was walking along the beach in Samos and saw a ship running before the wind; he exclaimed that in no long time she would go down, and, even as he watched her, down she went. And as he was drinking water which had been drawn up from a well he predicted that on the third day there would be an earthquake; which came to pass. And on his way from Olympia he advised Perilaus, his host in Messene, to move thence with all belonging to him; but Perilaus could not be persuaded, and Messene was afterwards taken.1

### 117
2 [117] Καὶ Λακεδαιμονίοις εἰπεῖν μήτε χρυσὸν τιμᾶν μήτε ἄργυρον, ὥς φησι Θεόπομπος ἐν Θαυμασίοις: προστάξαι δὲ αὐτῷ ὄναρ τοῦτο τὸν Ἡρακλέα, ὃν καὶ τῆς αὐτῆς νυκτὸς τοῖς βασιλεῦσι κελεῦσαι Φερεκύδῃ πείθεσθαι. ἔνιοι δὲ Πυθαγόρᾳ περιάπτουσι ταῦτα.

[117] He bade the Lacedaemonians set no store by gold or silver, as Theopompus says in his Mirabilia. He told them he had received this command from Heracles in a dream; and the same night Heracles enjoined upon the kings to obey Pherecydes. But some fasten this story upon Pythagoras.

Φησὶ δ᾽ Ἕρμιππος πολέμου συνεστῶτος Ἐφεσίοις καὶ Μάγνησι βουλόμενον τοὺς Ἐφεσίους νικῆσαι πυθέσθαι τινὸς παριόντος πόθεν εἴη, τοῦ δ᾽ εἰπόντος "ἐξ Ἐφέσου," "ἕλκυσόν με τοίνυν, ἔφη, τῶν σκελῶν καὶ θὲς εἰς τὴν τῶν Μαγνήτων χώραν, καὶ ἀπάγγειλόν σου τοῖς πολίταις μετὰ τὸ νικῆσαι αὐτόθι με θάψαι: ἐπεσκηφέναι τε ταῦτα Φερεκύδην." 

Hermippus relates that on the eve of war between Ephesus and Magnesia he favoured the cause of the Ephesians, and inquired of some one passing by where he came from, and on receiving the reply "From Ephesus," he said, "Drag me by the legs and place me in the territory of Magnesia; and take a message to your countrymen that after their victory they must bury me there, and that this is the last injunction of Pherecydes." 

### 118
3 [118] ὁ μὲν <οὖν> ἀπήγγειλεν: οἱ δὲ μετὰ μίαν ἐπελθόντες κρατοῦσι τῶν Μαγνήτων, καὶ τόν τε Φερεκύδην μεταλλάξαντα θάπτουσιν αὐτόθι καὶ μεγαλοπρεπῶς τιμῶσιν. 

[118] The man gave the message; a day later the Ephesians attacked and defeated the Magnesians; they found Pherecydes dead and buried him on the spot with great honours. 

ἔνιοι δέ φασιν

ἐλθόντα εἰς Δελφοὺς ἀπὸ τοῦ Κωρυκίου ὄρους αὑτὸν δισκῆσαι. Ἀριστόξενος δ᾽ ἐν τῷ Περὶ Πυθαγόρου καὶ τῶν γνωρίμων αὐτοῦ φησι νοσήσαντα αὐτὸν ὑπὸ Πυθαγόρου ταφῆναι ἐν Δήλῳ. οἱ δὲ φθειριάσαντα τὸν βίον τελευτῆσαι: ὅτε καὶ Πυθαγόρου παραγενομένου καὶ πυνθανομένου, πῶς διακέοιτο, διαβαλόντα τῆς θύρας τὸν δάκτυλον εἰπεῖν, "χροῒ δῆλα": καὶ τοὐντεῦθεν παρὰ τοῖς φιλολόγοις ἡ λέξις ἐπὶ τῶν χειρόνων τάττεται, οἱ δ᾽ ἐπὶ τῶν βελτίστων χρώμενοι διαμαρτάνουσιν. 

Another version is that he came to Delphi and hurled himself down from Mount Corycus. But Aristoxenus in his work On Pythagoras and his School affirms that he died a natural death and was buried by Pythagoras in Delos; another account again is that he died of a verminous disease, that Pythagoras was also present and inquired how he was, that he thrust his finger through the doorway and exclaimed, "My skin tells its own tale," a phrase subsequently applied by the grammarians as equivalent to "getting worse," although some wrongly understand it to mean "all is going well." 

### 119
4 [119] ἔλεγέ τε ὅτι οἱ θεοὶ τὴν τράπεζαν θυωρὸν καλοῦσιν.

[119] He maintained that the divine name for "table" is θυωρός, or that which takes care of offerings.

Ἄνδρων δ᾽ ὁ Ἐφέσιός φησι δύο γεγονέναι Φερεκύδας Συρίους, τὸν μὲν ἀστρολόγον, τὸν δὲ θεολόγον υἱὸν Βάβυος, ᾧ καὶ Πυθαγόραν σχολάσαι. Ἐρατοσθένης δ᾽ ἕνα μόνον, καὶ ἕτερον Ἀθηναῖον, γενεαλόγον.

Andron of Ephesus says that there were two natives of Syros who bore the name of Pherecydes: the one was an astronomer, the other was the son of Babys and a theologian, teacher of Pythagoras. Eratosthenes, however, says that there was only one Pherecydes of Syros, the other Pherecydes being an Athenian and a genealogist.

Σώζεται δὲ τοῦ Συρίου τό τε βιβλίον ὃ συνέγραψεν, οὗ ἡ ἀρχή: "Ζὰς μὲν καὶ Χρόνος ἦσαν ἀεὶ καὶ Χθονίη: Χθονίῃ δὲ ὄνομα ἐγένετο Γῆ, ἐπειδὴ αὐτῇ Ζὰς γῆν γέρας διδοῖ." σώζεται δὲ καὶ ἡλιοτροπεῖον ἐν Σύρῳ τῇ νήσῳ.

There is preserved a work by Pherecydes of Syros, a work which begins thus: "Zeus and Time and Earth were from all eternity, and Earth was called Γῆ because Zeus gave her earth (γῆ) as guerdon (γέρας)." His sun-dial is also preserved in the island of Syros.

Φησὶ δὲ Δοῦρις ἐν τῷ δευτέρῳ τῶν Ὡρῶν ἐπιγεγράφθαι αὐτῷ τὸ ἐπίγραμμα τόδε:

Duris in the second book of his Horae gives the inscription on his tomb as follows2:

### 120

5 [120] τῆς σοφίης πάσης ἐν ἐμοὶ τέλος: ἢν δέ τι πλεῖον,

[120] All knowledge that a man may have had I;

Πυθαγόρῃ τὠμῷ λέγε ταῦθ᾽, ὅτι πρῶτος ἁπάντων

Yet tell Pythagoras, were more thereby,

ἔστιν ἀν᾽ Ἑλλάδα γῆν: οὐ ψεύδομαι ὧδ᾽ ἀγορεύων.

That first of all Greeks is he; I speak no lie.

Ἴων δ᾽ ὁ Χῖός φησιν περὶ αὐτοῦ.

Ion of Chios says of him3:

ὣς ὁ μὲν ἠνορέῃ τε κεκασμένος ἠδὲ καὶ αἰδοῖ

With manly worth endowed and modesty,

καὶ φθίμενος ψυχῇ τερπνὸν ἔχει βίοτον,

Though he be dead, his soul lives happily,

εἴπερ Πυθαγόρης ἐτύμως ὁ σοφὸς περὶ πάντων

If wise Pythagoras indeed saw light

ἀνθρώπων γνώμας ᾔδεε κἀξέμαθεν.

And read the destinies of men aright.

Ἐστι καὶ ἡμῶν οὕτως ἔχον τῷ μέτρῳ τῷ Φερεκρατείῳ:

There is also an epigram of my own in the Pherecratean metre4:

τὸν κλεινὸν Φερεκύδην,

The famous Pherecydes,

ὃν τίκτει ποτὲ Σῦρος,

to whom Syros gave birth, 

### 121

6 [121] ἐς φθεῖρας λόγος ἐστὶν

ἀλλάξαι τὸ πρὶν εἶδος,

θεῖναί τ᾽ εὐθὺ κελεύειν

Μαγνήτων, ἵνα νίκην

δοίη τοῖς Ἐφέσοιο

γενναίοις πολιήταις.

ἦν γὰρ χρησμός, ὃν ᾔδει

μοῦνος, τοῦτο κελεύων:

καὶ θνήσκει παρ᾽ ἐκείνοις.

ἦν οὖν τοῦτ᾽ ἄρ᾽ ἀληθές:

ἢν ᾖ τις σοφὸς ὄντως,

καὶ ζῶν ἐστιν ὄνησις,

χὤταν μηδὲν ὑπάρχῃ.

[121] when his former beauty was consumed by vermin, gave orders that he should be taken straight to the Magnesian land in order that he might give victory to the noble Ephesians. There was an oracle, which he alone knew, enjoining this; and there he died among them. It seems then it is a true tale; if anyone is truly wise, he brings blessings both in his lifetime and when he is no more.

Γέγονε δὲ κατὰ τὴν πεντηκοστὴν καὶ ἐνάτην Ὀλυμπιάδα. καὶ ἐπέστειλεν ὧδε:

He lived in the 59th Olympiad. He wrote the following letter:

### 122
Φερεκύδης Θαλῇ
7 [122] "Εὖ θνήσκοις ὅταν τοι τὸ χρεὼν ἥκῃ: νοῦσός με καταλελάβηκε δεδεγμένον τὰ παρὰ σέο γράμματα. φθειρῶν ἔβρυον πᾶς καί με εἶχεν ἠπίαλος. ἐπέσκηψα δ᾽ ὦν τοῖσιν οἰκιήτῃσιν, ἐπήν με κατθάψωσιν, ἐς σὲ τὴν γραφὴν ἐνεῖκαι. σὺ δὲ ἢν δοκι-

Pherecydes to Thales
5
"May yours be a happy death when your time comes. Since I received your letter, I have been attacked by disease. I am infested with vermin and subject to a violent fever with shivering fits. I have therefore given instructions to my servants to carry my writing to you after they have buried me. I would like you to publish it, provided that you and the other sages approve of it, and not otherwise. For I myself am not yet satisfied with it. The facts are not absolutely correct, nor do I claim to have discovered the truth, but merely such things as one who inquires about the gods picks up. The rest must be thought out, for mine is all guess-work. As I was more and more weighed down with my malady, I did not permit any of the physicians or my friends to come into the room where I was, but, as they stood before the door and inquired how I was, I thrust my finger through the keyhole and showed them how plague-stricken I was; and I told them to come to-morrow to bury Pherecydes."

Καὶ οὗτοι μὲν οἱ κληθέντες σοφοί, οἷς τινες καὶ Πεισίστρατον τὸν τύραννον προσκαταλέγουσι. λεκτέον δὲ περὶ τῶν φιλοσόφων: καὶ πρῶτόν γε ἀρκτέον ἀπὸ τῆς Ἰωνικῆς φιλοσοφίας, ἧς καθηγήσατο Θαλῆς, οὗ διήκουσεν Ἀναξίμανδρος.

So much for those who are called the Sages, with whom some writers also class Pisistratus the tyrant. I must now proceed to the philosophers and start with the philosophy of Ionia. Its founder was Thales, and Anaximander was his pupil.

1 These stories no doubt come from Theopompus, whose work on Marvels is cited in the next paragraph.

2 Anth. Pal. vii. 93.

3 Fr. 4 Bergk.

4 Anth. Plan. iii. 128.

5 [122] This forgery is easily analysed. There is the tradition of the malady which proved fatal to Pherecydes ( cf. Porphyry, Vit. Pyth. §55), with the anecdote of his protruding his finger through the door. There is also an allusion to the alleged obscurity of the work on the gods which passed current as written by him.

Ἀντισθένης Ἀντισθένους Ἀθηναῖος. 

Antisthenes,1 the son of Antisthenes, was an Athenian. 

ἐλέγετο δ᾽ οὐκ εἶναι ἰθαγενής: ὅθεν καὶ πρὸς τὸν ὀνειδίζοντα εἰπεῖν, "καὶ ἡ μήτηρ τῶν θεῶν Φρυγία ἐστίν." 

It was said, however, that he was not of pure Attic blood. Hence his reply to one who taunted him with this: "The mother of the gods too is a Phrygian."2 

ἐδόκει γὰρ εἶναι Θρᾴττης μητρός: 

For his mother was supposed to have been a Thracian. 

ὅθεν καὶ ἐν Τανάγρᾳ κατὰ τὴν μάχην εὐδοκιμήσας ἔδωκε λέγειν Σωκράτει ὡς οὐκ ἂν ἐκ δυοῖν Ἀθηναίων οὕτω γεγόνοι γενναῖος. 

Hence it was that, when he had distinguished himself in the battle of Tanagra,3 he gave Socrates occasion to remark that, if both his parents had been Athenians, he would not have turned out so brave. 

καὶ αὐτὸς δὲ τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ἐπὶ τῷ γηγενεῖς εἶναι σεμνυνομένους ἐκφαυλίζων ἔλεγε μηδὲν εἶναι κοχλιῶν καὶ ἀττελέβων εὐγενεστέρους.

He himself showed his contempt for the airs which the Athenians gave themselves on the strength of being sprung from the soil by the remark that this did not make them any better born than snails or wingless locusts.

Οὗτος κατ᾽ ἀρχὰς μὲν ἤκουσε Γοργίου τοῦ ῥήτορος: 

To begin with, he became a pupil of Gorgias the rhetorician, 

ὅθεν τὸ ῥητορικὸν εἶδος ἐν τοῖς διαλόγοις ἐπιφέρει καὶ μάλιστα ἐν τῇ Ἀληθείᾳ καὶ τοῖς Προτρεπτικοῖς.

and hence the rhetorical style that he introduces in his dialogues, and especially in his Truth and in his Exhortations.
#### 2
φησὶ δ᾽ Ἕρμιππος ὅτι προείλετο ἐν τῇ τῶν Ἰσθμίων πανηγύρει ψέξαι τε καὶ ἐπαινέσαι Ἀθηναίους, Θηβαίους, Λακεδαιμονίους: 

According to Hermippus he intended at the public gathering for the Isthmian games to discourse on the faults and merits of Athenians, Thebans and Lacedaemonians,

εἶτα μέντοι παραιτήσασθαι ἰδόντα πλείους ἐκ τῶν πόλεων ἀφιγμένους.

but begged to be excused when he saw throngs arriving from those cities.

Ὕστερον δὲ παρέβαλε Σωκράτει, καὶ τοσοῦτον ὤνατο αὐτοῦ, ὥστε παρῄνει τοῖς μαθηταῖς γενέσθαι αὐτῷ πρὸς Σωκράτην συμμαθητάς. 

Later on, however, he came into touch with Socrates, and derived so much benefit from him that he used to advise his own disciples to become fellow-pupils with him of Socrates. 

οἰκῶν τ᾽ ἐν Πειραιεῖ καθ᾽ ἑκάστην ἡμέραν τοὺς τετταράκοντα σταδίους ἀνιὼν ἤκουε Σωκράτους, παρ᾽ οὗ καὶ τὸ καρτερικὸν λαβὼν καὶ τὸ ἀπαθὲς ζηλώσας κατῆρξε πρῶτος τοῦ κυνισμοῦ. 

He lived in the Peiraeus, and every day would tramp the five miles to Athens in order to hear Socrates. From Socrates he learned his hardihood, emulating his disregard of feeling, and thus he inaugurated the Cynic way of life. 

καὶ ὅτι ὁ πόνος ἀγαθὸν συνέστησε διὰ τοῦ μεγάλου Ἡρακλέους καὶ τοῦ Κύρου, τὸ μὲν ἀπὸ τῶν Ἑλλήνων, τὸ δὲ ἀπὸ τῶν βαρβάρων ἑλκύσας.

He demonstrated that pain is a good thing by instancing the great Heracles and Cyrus, drawing the one example from the Greek world and the other from the barbarians.

#### 23
βακτηρίᾳ δ᾽ ἐπεστηρίζετο ἀσθενήσας: 

He did not lean upon a staff until he grew infirm ; 

ἔπειτα μέντοι καὶ διὰ παντὸς ἐφόρει, οὐ μὴν ἐν ἄστει, ἀλλὰ καθ᾽ ὁδὸν αὐτῇ τε καὶ τῇ πήρᾳ, καθά φησιν Ἀθηνόδωρος ὁ Ἀθηναίων προστατήσας καὶ Πολύευκτος ὁ ῥήτωρ καὶ Λυσανίας ὁ Αἰσχρίωνος. 

but afterwards he would carry it everywhere, not indeed in the city, but when walking along the road with it and with his wallet ; so say Olympiodorus,1 once a magistrate at Athens, Polyeuctus the orator, and Lysanias the son of Aeschrio. 

ἐπιστείλας δέ τινι οἰκίδιον αὐτῷ προνοήσασθαι, βραδύνοντος, τὸν ἐν τῷ Μητρῴῳ πίθον ἔσχεν οἰκίαν, ὡς καὶ αὐτὸς ἐν ταῖς ἐπιστολαῖς διασαφεῖ. 

He had written to some one to try and procure a cottage for him. When this man was a long time about it, he took for his abode the tub in the Metroön, as he himself explains in his letters. 

καὶ θέρους μὲν ἐπὶ ψάμμου ζεστῆς ἐκυλινδεῖτο, χειμῶνος δ᾽ ἀνδριάντας κεχιονισμένους περιελάμβανε, πανταχόθεν ἑαυτὸν συνασκῶν.

And in summer he used to roll in it over hot sand, while in winter he used to embrace statues covered with snow, using every means of inuring himself to hardship.
#### 34
Πρὸς τοὺς εἰπόντας, "γέρων εἶ καὶ λοιπὸν ἄνες," "τί δέ," ἔφη, "εἰ δόλιχον ἔτρεχον, πρὸς τῷ τέλει ἔδει με ἀνεῖναι καὶ μὴ μᾶλλον ἐπιτεῖναι;" 

To those who said to him, "You are an old man ; take a rest," "What ?" he replied, "if I were running in the stadium, ought I to slacken my pace when approaching the goal ? ought I not rather to put on speed ?" 

κληθεὶς ἐπὶ δεῖπνον οὐκ ἔφη παρέσεσθαι: μηδὲ γὰρ πρῴην αὐτῷ χάριν ἐγνωκέναι. 

Having been invited to a dinner, he declared that he wouldn't go ; for, the last time he went, his host had not expressed a proper gratitude. 

γυμνοῖς ποσὶ χιόνα ἐπάτει καὶ τἄλλα ὅσα ἄνω προείρηται: 

He would walk upon snow barefoot and do the other things mentioned above. 

καὶ ὠμὰ δὲ κρέα ἐπεχείρησε φαγεῖν, ἀλλ᾽ οὐ διῴκησε. 

Not only so ; he even attempted to eat meat raw, but could not manage to digest it. 

κατέλαβέ ποτε Δημοσθένην τὸν ῥήτορα ἐν πανδοκείῳ ἀριστῶντα. 

He once found Demosthenes the orator lunching at an inn, 

τοῦ δ᾽ ὑποχωροῦντος, "τοσούτῳ μᾶλλον," ἔφη, "ἔσῃ ἐν τῷ πανδοκείῳ." 

and, when he retired within, Diogenes said, "All the more you will be inside the tavern." 

ξένων δέ ποτε θεάσασθαι θελόντων Δημοσθένην, τὸν μέσον δάκτυλον ἐκτείνας, "οὗτος ὑμῖν," ἔφη, "ἐστὶν ὁ Ἀθηναίων δημαγωγός." 16

When some strangers expressed a wish to see Demosthenes, he stretched out his middle finger and said, "There goes the demagogue of Athens."
#### 35
ἐκβαλόντος δ᾽ ἄρτον τινὸς καὶ αἰσχυνομένου ἀνελέσθαι, βουλόμενος αὐτὸν νουθετῆσαι, κεράμου τράχηλον δήσας ἔσυρε διὰ τοῦ Κεραμεικοῦ.

Some one dropped a loaf of bread and was ashamed to pick it up ; whereupon Diogenes, wishing to read him a lesson, tied a rope to the neck of a wine-jar and proceeded to drag it across the Ceramicus.

Μιμεῖσθαι ἔλεγε τοὺς χοροδιδασκάλους: 

He used to say that he followed the example of the trainers of choruses ; 

καὶ γὰρ ἐκείνους ὑπὲρ τόνον ἐνδιδόναι ἕνεκα τοῦ τοὺς λοιποὺς ἅψασθαι τοῦ προσήκοντος τόνου. 

for they too set the note a little high, to ensure that the rest should hit the right note. 

τοὺς πλείστους ἔλεγε παρὰ δάκτυλον μαίνεσθαι: 

Most people, he would say, are so nearly mad that a finger makes all the difference. 

ἐὰν οὖν τις τὸν μέσον προτείνας πορεύηται, δόξει τῳ μαίνεσθαι, ἐὰν δὲ τὸν λιχανόν, οὐκέτι. 

For, if you go along with your middle finger stretched out, some one will think you mad, but, if it's the little finger, he will not think so. 

τὰ πολλοῦ ἄξια τοῦ μηδενὸς ἔλεγε πιπράσκεσθαι καὶ ἔμπαλιν: 

Very valuable things, said he, were bartered for things of no value, and vice versa. 

ἀνδριάντα γοῦν τρισχιλίων πιπράσκεσθαι, χοίνικα δ᾽ ἀλφίτων δύο χαλκῶν.

At all events a statue fetches three thousand drachmas, while a quart of barley-flour is sold for two copper coins.
#### 37
Θεασάμενός ποτε παιδίον ταῖς χερσὶ πῖνον ἐξέρριψε τῆς πήρας τὴν κοτύλην, εἰπών, "παιδίον με νενίκηκεν εὐτελείᾳ." 

One day, observing a child drinking out of his hands, he cast away the cup from his wallet with the words, "A child has beaten me in plainness of living." 

ἐξέβαλε δὲ καὶ τὸ τρυβλίον, ὁμοίως παιδίον θεασάμενος, ἐπειδὴ κατέαξε τὸ σκεῦος, τῷ κοίλῳ τοῦ ψωμίου τὴν φακῆν ὑποδεχόμενον. 

He also threw away his bowl when in like manner he saw a child who had broken his plate taking up his lentils with the hollow part of a morsel of bread. 

συνελογίζετο δὲ καὶ οὕτως: τῶν θεῶν ἐστι πάντα: φίλοι δὲ οἱ σοφοὶ τοῖς θεοῖς: κοινὰ δὲ τὰ τῶν φίλων. πάντ᾽ ἄρα ἐστὶ τῶν σοφῶν. 

He used also to reason thus: "All things belong to the gods. The wise are friends of the gods, and friends hold things in common. Therefore all things belong to the wise." 

θεασάμενός ποτε γυναῖκα ἀσχημονέστερον τοῖς θεοῖς προσπίπτουσαν, βουλόμενος αὐτῆς περιελεῖν τὴν δεισιδαιμονίαν, καθά φησι Ζωίλος ὁ Περγαῖος, προσελθὼν εἶπεν, 

One day he saw a woman kneeling before the gods in an ungraceful attitude, and wishing to free her of superstition, according to Zoïlus of Perga, he came forward and said, 

"οὐκ εὐλαβῇ, ὦ γύναι, μή ποτε θεοῦ ὄπισθεν ἑστῶτοσ--πάντα γάρ ἐστιν αὐτοῦ πλήρη--ἀσχημονήσῃς;" 19

"Are you not afraid, my good woman, that a god may be standing behind you ?--for all things are full of his presence--and you may be put to shame ?
#### 39
[39] ὁμοίως καὶ πρὸς τὸν εἰπόντα ὅτι κίνησις οὐκ ἔστιν, ἀναστὰς περιεπάτει. 

[39] In like manner, when somebody declared that there is no such thing as motion, he got up and walked about. 

πρὸς τὸν λέγοντα περὶ τῶν μετεώρων, "ποσταῖος," ἔφη, "πάρει ἀπὸ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ;" 

When some one was discoursing on celestial phenomena, "How many days," asked Diogenes, "were you in coming from the sky ?" 

εὐνούχου μοχθηροῦ ἐπιγράψαντος ἐπὶ τὴν οἰκίαν, "μηδὲν εἰσίτω κακόν," "ὁ οὖν κύριος," ἔφη, "τῆς οἰκίας ποῦ εἰσέλθῃ;" 

A eunuch of bad character had inscribed on his door the words, "Let nothing evil enter." "How then," he asked, "is the master of the house to get in ?" 

τῷ μύρῳ τοὺς πόδας ἀλειψάμενος ἔφη ἀπὸ μὲν τῆς κεφαλῆς εἰς τὸν ἀέρα ἀπιέναι τὸ μύρον, ἀπὸ δὲ τῶν ποδῶν εἰς τὴν ὄσφρησιν. 

When he had anointed his feet with unguent, he declared that from his head the unguent passed into the air, but from his feet into his nostrils. 

ἀξιούντων Ἀθηναίων μυηθῆναι αὐτὸν καὶ λεγόντων ὡς ἐν ᾄδου προεδρίας οἱ μεμυημένοι τυγχάνουσι, 

The Athenians urged him to become initiated, and told him that in the other world those who have been initiated enjoy a special privilege. 

"γελοῖον," ἔφη, "εἰ Ἀγησίλαος μὲν καὶ Ἐπαμεινώνδας ἐν τῷ βορβόρῳ διάξουσιν, εὐτελεῖς δέ τινες μεμυημένοι ἐν ταῖς μακάρων νήσοις ἔσονται."

"It would be ludicrous," quoth he, "if Agesilaus and Epaminondas are to dwell in the mire, while certain folk of no account will live in the Isles of the Blest because they have been initiated."
#### 40
22 [40] Πρὸς τοὺς ἑρπύσαντας ἐπὶ τὴν τράπεζαν μῦς, "ἰδού," φησί, "καὶ Διογένης παρασίτους τρέφει." 

[40] When mice crept on to the table he addressed them thus, "See now even Diogenes keeps parasites." 

Πλάτωνος εἰπόντος αὐτὸν κύνα, "ναί," ἔφη: "ἐγὼ γὰρ ἐπανῆλθον ἐπὶ τοὺς πεπρακότας." 

When Plato styled him a dog, "Quite true," he said, "for I come back again and again to those who have sold me." 

ἐκ τοῦ βαλανείου ἐξιὼν τῷ μὲν πυθομένῳ εἰ πολλοὶ ἄνθρωποι λοῦνται, ἠρνήσατο: τῷ δ᾽, εἰ πολὺς ὄχλος, ὡμολόγησε. 

As he was leaving the public baths, somebody inquired if many men were bathing. He said, No. But to another who asked if there was a great crowd of bathers, he said, Yes. 

Πλάτωνος ὁρισαμένου, Ἄνθρωπός ἐστι ζῷον δίπουν ἄπτερον, καὶ εὐδοκιμοῦντος, τίλας ἀλεκτρυόνα εἰσήνεγκεν αὐτὸν εἰς τὴν σχολὴν καί φησιν, "οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ Πλάτωνος ἄνθρωπος." 

Plato had defined Man as an animal, biped and featherless, and was applauded. Diogenes plucked a fowl and brought it into the lecture-room with the words, "Here is Plato's man." 

ὅθεν τῷ ὅρῳ προσετέθη τὸ πλατυώνυχον. 

In consequence of which there was added to the definition, "having broad nails." 

πρὸς τὸν πυθόμενον ποίᾳ ὥρᾳ δεῖ ἀριστᾶν, "εἰ μὲν πλούσιος," ἔφη, "ὅταν θέλῃ: εἰ δὲ πένης, ὅταν ἔχῃ.

To one who asked what was the proper time for lunch, he said, "If a rich man, when you will; if a poor man, when you can.
#### 45
[45] Θεασάμενός ποτε τοὺς ἱερομνήμονας τῶν ταμιῶν τινα φιάλην ὑφῃρημένον ἀπάγοντας ἔφη, "οἱ μεγάλοι κλέπται τὸν μικρὸν ἀπάγουσι." 

[45] Once he saw the officials of a temple leading away some one who had stolen a bowl belonging to the treasurers, and said, "The great thieves are leading away the little thief." 

θεασάμενός ποτε μειράκιον λίθους βάλλον ἐπὶ σταυρόν, "εὖγε," εἶπε, "τεύξῃ γὰρ τοῦ σκοποῦ." 

Noticing a lad one day throwing stones at a cross (gibbet), "Well done," he said, "you will hit your mark."12 

πρὸς τὰ περιστάντα μειράκια καὶ εἰπόντα, "βλέπωμεν μὴ δάκῃ ἡμᾶς," "θαρρεῖτε," ἔφη, "παιδία: κύων τευτλία οὐκ ἐσθίει." 

When some boys clustered round him and said, "Take care he doesn't bite us," he answered, "Never fear, boys, a dog does not eat beetroot." 

πρὸς τὸν ἐπὶ τῇ λεοντῇ θρυπτόμενον, "παῦσαι," ἔφη, "τὰ τῆς ἀρετῆς στρώματα καταισχύνων." 

To one who was proud of wearing a lion's skin his words were, "Leave off dishonouring the habiliments of courage." 

πρὸς τὸν μακαρίζοντα Καλλισθένην καὶ λέγοντα ὡς πολυτελῶν παρ᾽ Ἀλεξάνδρῳ μετέχει, "κακοδαίμων μὲν οὖν ἐστιν," εἶπεν, "ὃς καὶ ἀριστᾷ καὶ δειπνεῖ ὅταν Ἀλεξάνδρῳ δόξῃ."28 

When some one was extolling the good fortune of Callisthenes and saying what splendour he shared in the suite of Alexander, "Not so," said Diogenes, "but rather ill fortune; for he breakfasts and dines when Alexander thinks fit."
#### 46
[46] Χρημάτων δεόμενος ἀπαιτεῖν ἔλεγε τοὺς φίλους, οὐκ αἰτεῖν. 

[46] Being short of money, he told his friends that he applied to them not for alms, but for repayment of his due. 

ἐπ᾽ ἀγορᾶς ποτε χειρουργῶν, "εἴθε," ἔφη, "καὶ τὴν κοιλίαν ἦν παρατρίψαντα μὴ πεινῆν." 

When behaving indecently in the marketplace, he wished it were as easy to relieve hunger by rubbing an empty stomach. 

μειράκιον θεασάμενος μετὰ σατραπῶν ἐπὶ δεῖπνον ἀπιόν, ἀποσπάσας πρὸς τοὺς οἰκείους ἀπήγαγε καὶ ἐκέλευσε τηρεῖν. 

Seeing a youth starting off to dine with satraps, he dragged him off, took him to his friends and bade them keep strict watch over him. 

πρὸς τὸ κεκοσμημένον μειράκιον πυθόμενόν τι ἔφη οὐ πρότερον λέξειν αὐτῷ, εἰ μὴ ἀνασυράμενος δείξειε πότερον γυνή ἐστιν ἢ ἀνήρ. 

When a youth effeminately attired put a question to him, he declined to answer unless he pulled up his robe and showed whether he was man or woman. 

πρὸς τὸ κοτταβίζον ἐν τῷ βαλανείῳ μειράκιόν φησιν, "ὅσῳ βέλτιον, τοσούτῳ χεῖρον." 

A youth was playing cottabos in the baths. Diogenes said to him, "The better you play, the worse it is for you." 

ἐν δείπνῳ προσερρίπτουν αὐτῷ τινες ὀστάρια ὡς κυνί: καὶ ὃς ἀπαλλαττόμενος προσεούρησεν αὐτοῖς ὡς κύων.

At a feast certain people kept throwing all the bones to him as they would have done to a dog.13 Thereupon he played a dog's trick and drenched them.

Ἰδών ποτε δραπέτην ἐπὶ φρέατι καθήμενον ἔφη, "μειράκιον, βλέπε μὴ ἐμπέσῃς." 

One day seeing a runaway slave sitting on the brink of a well, he said, "Take care, my lad, you don't fall in." 

ἰδὼν [μειρακύλλιον] ἱματιοκλέπτην ἐν τῷ βαλανείῳ ἔφη, "ἐπ᾽ ἀλειμμάτιον ἢ ἐπ᾽ ἄλλ᾽ ἱμάτιον;" 

Seeing a boy taking clothes at the baths, he asked, "Is it for a little unguent ( ἀλειμμ άτιον) or is it for a new cloak (ἄλλ᾽ ἱμάτιον)?" 

ἰδών ποτε γυναῖκας ἀπ᾽ ἐλαίας ἀπηγχονισμένας, "εἴθε γάρ," ἔφη, "πάντα τὰ δένδρα τοιοῦτον καρπὸν ἤνεγκεν." 

Seeing some women hanged from an olive-tree, he said, "Would that every tree bore similar fruit." 

ἰδὼν λωποδύτην ἔφη, τἰπτε σὺ ὧδε, φέριστε; ἦ τινα συλήσων νεκύων κατατεθνηώτων;

On seeing a footpad he accosted him thus: What mak'st thou here, my gallant ? Com'st thou perchance for plunder of the dead?17

ἐρωτηθεὶς εἰ παιδισκάριον ἢ παιδάριον ἔχοι, ἔφη, "οὔ:" τοῦ δὲ εἰπόντος, 

Being asked whether he had any maid or boy to wait on him, he said "No."

On being asked by somebody, "What sort of a man do you consider Diogenes to be?" 

"Σωκράτης," εἶπε, "μαινόμενος." 37 

"A Socrates gone mad," said he.19 

ἐρωτηθεὶς ποίῳ καιρῷ δεῖ γαμεῖν, ἔφη, "τοὺς μὲν νέους μηδέπω, τοὺς δὲ πρεσβυτέρους μηδεπώποτε." 

Being asked what was the right time to marry, Diogenes replied, "For a young man not yet: for an old man never at all." 

ἐρωτηθεὶς τί θέλοι κονδύλου λαβεῖν, "περικεφαλαίαν," ἔφη. 

Being asked what he would take to be soundly cuffed, he replied, "A helmet." 

μειράκιον ἰδὼν καλλωπιζόμενον ἔφη, "εἰ μὲν πρὸς ἄνδρας, ἀτυχεῖς: εἰ δὲ πρὸς γυναῖκας, ἀδικεῖς." 

Seeing a youth dressing with elaborate care, he said, "If it's for men, you're a fool; if for women, a knave." 

ἰδών ποτε μειράκιον ἐρυθριῶν, "θάρρει," ἔφη: "τοιοῦτόν ἐστι τῆς ἀρετῆς τὸ χρῶμα." 

One day he detected a youth blushing. "Courage," quoth he, "that is the hue of virtue."

One day after listening to a couple of lawyers disputing, he condemned them both, saying that the one had no doubt stolen, but the other had not lost anything. 

ἐρωτηθεὶς ποῖον οἶνον ἡδέως πίνει, ἔφη, "τὸν ἀλλότριον." 

To the question what wine he found pleasant to drink, he replied, "That for which other people pay." 

πρὸς τὸν εἰπόντα, "πολλοί σου καταγελῶσιν," "ἀλλ᾽ ἐγώ," ἔφη, "οὐ καταγελῶμαι.

When he was told that many people laughed at him, he made answer, "But I am not laughed down.

[60] He was returning from Olympia, and when somebody inquired whether there was a great crowd, "Yes," he said, "a great crowd, but few who could be called men." 

τοὺς ἀσώτους εἶπε παραπλησίους εἶναι συκαῖς ἐπὶ κρημνῷ πεφυκυίαις, ὧν τοῦ καρποῦ ἄνθρωπος μὲν οὐκ ἀπογεύεται, κόρακες δὲ καὶ γῦπες ἐσθίουσι. 

Libertines he compared to figtrees growing upon a cliff: whose fruit is not enjoyed by any man, but is eaten by ravens and vultures. 

Φρύνης Ἀφροδίτην χρυσῆν ἀναθείσης ἐν Δελφοῖς φασὶ τοῦτον ἐπιγράψαι, "ἀπὸ τῆς τῶν Ἑλλήνων ἀκρασίας." 

When Phryne set up a golden statue of Aphrodite in Delphi, Diogenes is said to have written upon it: "From the licentiousness of Greece."

Ἀλεξάνδρου ποτὲ ἐπιστάντος αὐτῷ καὶ εἰπόντος, "ἐγώ εἰμι Ἀλέξανδρος ὁ μέγας βασιλεύς," "κἀγώ," φησί, "Διογένης ὁ κύων." 

Alexander once came and stood opposite him and said, "I am Alexander the great king." "And I," said he, "am Diogenes the Cynic."24 

ἐρωτηθεὶς τί ποιῶν κύων καλεῖται, ἔφη, "τοὺς μὲν διδόντας σαίνων, τοὺς δὲ μὴ διδόντας ὑλακτῶν, τοὺς δὲ πονηροὺς δάκνων."44 

Being asked what he had done to be called a hound, he said, "I fawn on those who give me anything, I yelp at those who refuse, and I set my teeth in rascals."
#### 61
[61] Ἀπὸ συκῆς ὠπώριζε: τοῦ δὲ φυλάττοντος εἰπόντος, "αὐτόθεν πρῴην ἄνθρωπος ἀπήγξατο," "ἐγὼ οὖν," φησίν, "αὐτὴν καθαρῶ." 

[61] He was gathering figs, and was told by the keeper that not long before a man had hanged himself on that very fig-tree. "Then," said he, "I will now purge it." 

ἰδὼν Ὀλυμπιονίκην εἰς ἑταίραν πυκνότερον ἀτενίζοντα, "ἴδε," ἔφη, "κριὸν Ἀρειμάνιον ὡς ὑπὸ τοῦ τυχόντος κορασίου τραχηλίζεται." 

Seeing an Olympian victor casting repeated glances at a courtesan, "See," he said, "yonder ram frenzied for battle, how he is held fast by the neck fascinated by a common minx." 

τὰς εὐπρεπεῖς ἑταίρας ἔλεγε θανασίμῳ μελικράτῳ παραπλησίας εἶναι. 

Handsome courtesans he would compare to a deadly honeyed potion. 

ἀριστῶντι αὐτῷ ἐν ἀγορᾷ οἱ περιεστῶτες συνεχὲς ἔλεγον, "κύον:" ὁ δέ, "ὑμεῖς," εἶπεν, "ἐστὲ κύνες, οἵ με ἀριστῶντα περιεστήκατε." δύο μαλακῶν περικρυπτομένων αὐτὸν ἔφη, "μὴ εὐλαβεῖσθε: κύων τευτλία οὐ τρώγει." 

He was breakfasting in the marketplace, and the bystanders gathered round him with cries of "dog." "It is you who are dogs," cried he, "when you stand round and watch me at my breakfast." 

περὶ παιδὸς πεπορνευκότος ἐρωτηθεὶς πόθεν εἴη, "Τεγεάτης," ἔφη. 45

When two cowards hid away from him, he called out, "Don't be afraid, a hound is not fond of beetroot." 
#### 73
Μηδέν τε ἄτοπον εἶναι ἐξ ἱεροῦ τι λαβεῖν ἢ τῶν ζῴων τινὸς γεύσασθαι: 

And he saw no impropriety either in stealing anything from a temple or in eating the flesh of any animal ; 

μηδ᾽ ἀνόσιον εἶναι τὸ καὶ τῶν ἀνθρωπείων κρεῶν ἅψασθαι, ὡς δῆλον ἐκ τῶν ἀλλοτρίων ἐθῶν: 

nor even anything impious in touching human flesh, this, he said, being clear from the custom of some foreign nations. 

καὶ τῷ ὀρθῷ λόγῳ πάντ᾽ ἐν πᾶσι καὶ διὰ πάντων εἶναι λέγων. 

Moreover, according to right reason, as he put it, all elements are contained in all things and pervade everything : 

καὶ γὰρ ἐν τῷ ἄρτῳ κρέας εἶναι καὶ ἐν τῷ λαχάνῳ ἄρτον, καὶ τῶν σωμάτων τῶν λοιπῶν ἐν πᾶσι διά τινων ἀδήλων πόρων [καὶ]60 ὄγκων εἰσκρινομένων καὶ συνατμιζομένων, ὡς δῆλον ἐν τῷ Πυέστῃ ποιεῖ, εἴ γ᾽ αὐτοῦ αἱ τραγῳδίαι καὶ μὴ Φιλίσκου τοῦ Αἰγινήτου ἐκείνου γνωρίμου ἢ Πασιφῶντος τοῦ Λουκιανοῦ, ὅν φησι Φαβωρῖνος ἐν Παντοδαπῇ ἱστορίᾳ μετὰ τὴν τελευτὴν αὐτοῦ συγγράψαι. 

since not only is meat a constituent of bread, but bread of vegetables ; and all other bodies also, by means of certain invisible passages and particles, find their way in and unite with all substances in the form of vapour. This he makes plain in the Thyestes, if the tragedies are really his and not the work of his friend Philiscus of Aegina or of Pasiphon, the son of Lucian,31 who according to Favorinus in his Miscellaneous History wrote them after the death of Diogenes. 

μουσικῆς τε καὶ γεωμετρικῆς καὶ ἀστρολογίας καὶ τῶν τοιούτων ἀμελεῖν, ὡς ἀχρήστων καὶ οὐκ ἀναγκαίων.

He held that we should neglect music, geometry, astronomy, and the like studies, as useless and unnecessary.
#### 77
[77] ἀλλ᾽ ἀνέβα χεῖλος ποτ᾽ ὀδόντας ἐρείσας [καὶ τὸ πνεῦμα συνδακών]. ἦς γὰρ ἀλαθέως Διογένης Ζανὸς γόνος οὐράνιός τε κύων.

[77] But he soared aloft with his lip tightly pressed against his teeth And holding his breath withal. For in truth he was rightly named Diogenes, a true-born son of Zeus, a hound of heaven.

Ἄλλοι φασὶ πολύπουν κυσὶ συμμερίσασθαι βουλόμενον οὕτω δηχθῆναι τοῦ ποδὸς τὸν τένοντα καὶ καταστρέψαι. οἱ μέντοι γνώριμοι αὐτοῦ, καθά φησιν Ἀντισθένης ἐν Διαδοχαῖς, εἴκαζον τὴν τοῦ πνεύματος συγκράτησιν. 

Another version is that, while trying to divide an octopus amongst the dogs, he was so severely bitten on the sinew of the foot that it caused his death. His friends, however, according to Antisthenes in his Successions of Philosophers, conjectured that it was due to the retention of his breath. 

ἐτύγχανε μὲν γὰρ διάγων ἐν τῷ Κρανείῳ τῷ πρὸ τῆς Κορίνθου γυμνασίῳ: 

For he happened to be living in the Craneum, the gymnasium in front of Corinth. 

κατὰ δὲ τὸ ἔθος ἧκον οἱ γνώριμοι καὶ αὐτὸν καταλαμβάνουσιν ἐγκεκαλυμμένον καὶ εἴκασαν αὐτὸν κοιμᾶσθαι: οὐδὲ γὰρ ἦν τις νυσταλέος καὶ ὑπνηλός. 

When his friends came according to custom and found him wrapped up in his cloak, they thought that he must be asleep, although he was by no means of a drowsy or somnolent habit. 

ὅθεν, ἀποπετάσαντες τὸν τρίβωνα ἔκπνουν αὐτὸν καταλαμβάνουσι καὶ ὑπέλαβον τοῦτο πρᾶξαι βουλόμενον λοιπὸν ὑπεξελθεῖν τοῦ βίου.65 

They therefore drew aside his cloak and found that he was dead. This they supposed to have been his deliberate act in order to escape thenceforward from life.
#### 78
[78] Ἔνθα καὶ στάσις, ὥς φασιν, ἐγένετο τῶν γνωρίμων, τίνες αὐτὸν θάψουσιν: ἀλλὰ καὶ μέχρι χειρῶν ἦλθον. 

[78] Hence, it is said, arose a quarrel among his disciples as to who should bury him : nay, they even came to blows ; 

ἀφικομένων δὲ τῶν πατέρων καὶ τῶν ὑπερεχόντων, ὑπὸ τούτοις ταφῆναι τὸν ἄνδρα παρὰ τῇ πύλῃ τῇ φερούσῃ εἰς τὸν Ἰσθμόν. 

but, when their fathers and men of influence arrived, under their direction he was buried beside the gate leading to the Isthmus. 

ἐπέστησάν τ᾽ αὐτῷ κίονα καὶ ἐπ᾽ αὐτῷ λίθου Παρίου κύνα. 

Over his grave they set up a pillar and a dog in Parian marble upon it. 

ὕστερον δὲ καὶ οἱ πολῖται αὐτοῦ χαλκαῖς εἰκόσιν ἐτίμησαν αὐτὸν καὶ ἐπέγραψαν οὕτω:

Subsequently his fellow-citizens honoured him with bronze statues, on which these verses were inscribed :

γηράσκει καὶ χαλκὸς ὑπὸ χρόνου, ἀλλὰ σὸν οὔτι κῦδος ὁ πᾶς αἰών, Διόγενες, καθελεῖ:

μοῦνος ἐπεὶ βιοτᾶς αὐτάρκεα δόξαν ἔδειξας θνατοῖς καὶ ζωᾶς οἶμον ἐλαφροτάταν.

Time makes even bronze grow old : but thy glory, Diogenes, all eternity will never destroy. Since thou alone didst point out to mortals the lesson of self-sufficingness and the easiest path of life.33

### 1 
1 Ἐπειδὴ δὲ τὴν Ἰωνικὴν φιλοσοφίαν τὴν ἀπὸ Θαλοῦ καὶ τοὺς ἐν ταύτῃ διαγενομένους ἄνδρας ἀξιολόγους διεληλύθαμεν, 

Having now completed our account of the philosophy of Ionia starting with Thales, as well as of its chief representatives, 

φέρε καὶ περὶ τῆς Ἰταλικῆς διαλάβωμεν, ἧς ἦρξε Πυθαγόρας Μνησάρχου δακτυλιογλύφου, ὥς φησιν Ἕρμιππος, Σάμιος ἤ, ὡς Ἀριστόξενος, Τυρρηνὸς ἀπὸ μιᾶς τῶν νήσων ἃς ἔσχον Ἀθηναῖοι Τυρρηνοὺς ἐκβαλόντες. 

let us proceed to examine the philosophy of Italy, which was started by Pythagoras,[1](##b-e##1) son of the gem-engraver Mnesarchus, and according to Hermippus[f1](##fn##1), a Samian, or, according to Aristoxenus[f2](##fn##2), a Tyrrhenian from one of those islands which the Athenians held after clearing them of their Tyrrhenian inhabitants[f3](##fn##3). 

ἔνιοι δ᾽ υἱὸν μὲν εἶναι Μαρμάκου τοῦ Ἱππάσου τοῦ Εὐθύφρονος τοῦ Κλεωνύμου φυγάδος ἐκ Φλιοῦντος, οἰκεῖν δ᾽ ἐν Σάμῳ τὸν Μάρμακον, ὅθεν Σάμιον τὸν Πυθαγόραν λέγεσθαι: 2 

Some indeed say that he was descended through Euthyphro, Hippasus and Marmacus from Cleonymus, who was exiled from Phlius, and that, as Marmacus lived in Samos, so Pythagoras was called a Samian. 

### 2 
συστῆναι δ᾽ εἰς Λέσβον ἐλθόντα Φερεκύδῃ ὑπὸ Ζωίλου τοῦ θείου. 

From Samos he went, it is said, to Lesbos with an introduction to Pherecydes from his uncle Zoïlus. 

καὶ τρία ποτήρια κατασκευασάμενος ἀργυρᾶ δῶρον ἀπήνεγκεν ἑκάστῳ τῶν ἱερέων εἰς Αἴγυπτον. 

He had three silver flagons made and took them as presents to each of the priests of Egypt. 

ἔσχε δ᾽ ἀδελφούς, πρεσβύτερον μὲν Εὔνομον, μέσον δὲ Τυρρηνόν: καὶ δοῦλον Ζάμολξιν, ᾧ Γέται θύουσι, Κρόνον νομίζοντες, ὥς φησιν Ἡρόδοτος. 

He had brothers, of whom Eunomus was the elder and Tyrrhenus the second ; he also had a slave, Zamolxis, who is worshipped, so says Herodotus,2 by the Getans, as Cronos. 

οὗτος ἤκουσε μέν, καθὰ
προείρηται, Φερεκύδου τοῦ Συρίου: μετὰ δὲ τὴν ἐκείνου τελευτὴν ἧκεν εἰς Σάμον καὶ ἤκουσεν Ἑρμοδάμαντος τοῦ ἀπογόνου Κρεωφύλου, ἤδη πρεσβυτέρου. 

He was a pupil, as already stated, of Pherecydes of Syros, after whose death he went to Samos to be the pupil of Hermodamas, Creophylus's descendant, a man already advanced in years. 

νέος δ᾽ ὢν καὶ φιλομαθὴς ἀπεδήμησε τῆς πατρίδος καὶ πάσας ἐμυήθη τάς θ᾽ Ἑλληνικὰς καὶ βαρβαρικὰς τελετάς.3 

While still young, so eager was he for knowledge, he left his own country and had himself initiated into all the mysteries and rites not only of Greece but also of foreign countries. 

### 3 
ἐγένετ᾽ οὖν ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ, ὁπηνίκα καὶ Πολυκράτης αὐτὸν Ἀμάσιδι συνέστησε δι᾽ ἐπιστολῆς: 

Now he was in Egypt when Polycrates sent him a letter of introduction to Amasis ; 

καὶ ἐξέμαθε τὴν φωνὴν αὐτῶν, καθά φησιν Ἀντιφῶν ἐν τῷ Περὶ τῶν ἐν ἀρετῇ πρωτευσάντων, καὶ παρὰ Χαλδαίοις ἐγένετο καὶ Μάγοις. 

he learnt the Egyptian language, so we learn from [Antiphon in his book On Men of Outstanding Merit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiphon_(writer)#:~:text=virtue), and he also journeyed among the Chaldaeans and Magi. 

εἶτ᾽ ἐν Κρήτῃ σὺν Ἐπιμενίδῃ κατῆλθεν εἰς τὸ Ἰδαῖον ἄντρον, 

Then while in Crete he went down into the [cave of Ida](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Ida_(Crete)#Idaean_Cave) with [Epimenides](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epimenides#:~:text=cave) ; 

ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ εἰς τὰ ἄδυτα: καὶ τὰ περὶ θεῶν ἐν ἀπορρήτοις ἔμαθεν. 

he also entered the Egyptian sanctuaries,[3](##b-e##3) and was told their secret lore concerning the gods. 

εἶτ᾽ ἐπανῆλθεν εἰς Σάμον, καὶ εὑρὼν τὴν πατρίδα τυραννουμένην ὑπὸ Πολυκράτους, 

After that he returned to Samos to find his country under the tyranny of Polycrates ; 

ἀπῆρεν εἰς Κρότωνα τῆς Ἰταλίας: 

so he sailed away to Croton in Italy, 

κἀκεῖ νόμους θεὶς τοῖς Ἰταλιώταις 

and there he laid down a constitution for the Italian Greeks, 

ἐδοξάσθη σὺν τοῖς μαθηταῖς, 

and he and his followers were held in great estimation ; 

οἳ πρὸς τοὺς τριακοσίους ὄντες ᾠκονόμουν ἄριστα τὰ πολιτικά, ὥστε σχεδὸν ἀριστοκρατίαν εἶναι τὴν πολιτείαν.4 

for, being nearly three hundred in number, so well did they govern the state that its constitution was in effect a true aristocracy (government by the best).
### 4 
Τοῦτόν φησιν Ἡρακλείδης ὁ Ποντικὸς περὶ αὑτοῦ τάδε λέγειν, 

This is what [f4](##fn##4)Heraclides of Pontus tells us he used to say about himself : 

ὡς εἴη ποτὲ γεγονὼς Αἰθαλίδης καὶ Ἑρμοῦ υἱὸς νομισθείη: 

that he had once been [Aethalides](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aethalides) and was accounted to be Hermes' son, 

τὸν δὲ Ἑρμῆν εἰπεῖν αὐτῷ ἑλέσθαι ὅ τι ἂν βούληται πλὴν ἀθανασίας. 

and Hermes told him he might choose any gift he liked except immortality ; 

αἰτήσασθαι οὖν ζῶντα καὶ τελευτῶντα μνήμην ἔχειν τῶν συμβαινόντων. 

so he asked to retain through life and through death a memory of his experiences. 

ἐν μὲν οὖν τῇ ζωῇ πάντων διαμνημονεῦσαι: 

Hence in life he could recall everything, 

ἐπεὶ δὲ ἀποθάνοι, τηρῆσαι τὴν αὐτὴν μνήμην. 

and when he died he still kept the same memories. 

χρόνῳ δ᾽ ὕστερον εἰς Εὔφορβον ἐλθεῖν καὶ ὑπὸ Μενέλεω τρωθῆναι. 

Afterwards in course of time his soul entered into [Euphorbus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphorbus)[f5](##fn##5) and he was wounded by Menelaus. 

ὁ δ᾽ Εὔφορβος ἔλεγεν ὡς Αἰθαλίδης ποτὲ γεγόνοι καὶ ὅτι παρ᾽ Ἑρμοῦ τὸ δῶρον λάβοι 

Now Euphorbus used to say that he had once been Aethalides and obtained this gift from Hermes, 

καὶ τὴν τῆς ψυχῆς περιπόλησιν, ὡς περιεπολήθη καὶ εἰς ὅσα φυτὰ καὶ ζῷα παρεγένετο καὶ ὅσα ἡ ψυχὴ ἐν Ἅιδῃ ἔπαθε καὶ αἱ λοιπαὶ τίνα ὑπομένουσιν. 5 

and then he told of the wanderings of his soul, how it migrated hither and thither, into how many plants and animals it had come, and all that it underwent in Hades, and all that the other souls there have to endure. 
### 5
ἐπειδὴ δὲ Εὔφορβος ἀποθάνοι, μεταβῆναι τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ εἰς Ἑρμότιμον, 

When Euphorbus died, his soul passed into [Hermotimus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermotimus_of_Clazomenae), 

ὃς καὶ αὐτὸς πίστιν θέλων δοῦναι εἶτ᾽ ἀνῆλθεν[6](##b-g##6) εἰς Βραγχίδας καὶ εἰσελθὼν εἰς τὸ τοῦ Ἀπόλλωνος ἱερὸν ἐπέδειξεν ἣν Μενέλαος ἀνέθηκεν ἀσπίδα, ῾ἔφη γὰρ αὐτόν, ὅτ᾽ ἀπέπλει ἐκ Τροίας, ἀναθεῖναι τῷ Ἀπόλλωνι τὴν ἀσπίδα,᾿ 

and he also, wishing to authenticate the story, went up to the temple of Apollo at [Branchidae](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didyma#Names), where he identified the shield which Menelaus, on his voyage home from Troy, had dedicated to Apollo, so he said : 

διασεσηπυῖαν ἤδη, μόνον δὲ διαμένον τὸ ἐλεφάντινον πρόσωπον. 

the shield being now so rotten through and through that the ivory facing only was left. 

ἐπειδὴ δ᾽ Ἑρμότιμος ἀπέθανε, γενέσθαι Πύρρον τὸν Δήλιον ἁλιέα: 

When Hermotimus died, he became Pyrrhus, a fisherman of Delos, 

καὶ πάντα πάλιν μνημονεύειν, πῶς πρόσθεν Αἰθαλίδης, εἶτ᾽ Εὔφορβος, εἶτα Ἑρμότιμος, εἶτα Πύρρος γένοιτο. 

and again he remembered everything, how he was first Aethalides, then Euphorbus, then Hermotimus, and then Pyrrhus. 

ἐπειδὴ δὲ Πύρρος ἀπέθανε, γενέσθαι Πυθαγόραν καὶ πάντων τῶν εἰρημένων μεμνῆσθαι.7 

But when Pyrrhus died, he became Pythagoras, and still remembered all the facts mentioned.
### 6 
Ἔνιοι μὲν οὖν Πυθαγόραν μηδὲ ἓν καταλιπεῖν σύγγραμμά φασιν παίζοντες. 

There are some who insist, absurdly enough, that Pythagoras left no writings whatever. 

Ἡράκλειτος γοῦν ὁ φυσικὸς μονονουχὶ κέκραγε καί φησι: 

At all events Heraclitus, the physicist,[4](##b-e##4) almost shouts in our ear, 

"Πυθαγόρης Μνησάρχου ἱστορίην ἤσκησεν ἀνθρώπων μάλιστα πάντων καὶ ἐκλεξάμενος ταύτας τὰς συγγραφὰς ἐποιήσατο ἑαυτοῦ σοφίην, πολυμαθείην, κακοτεχνίην." 

"Pythagoras, son of Mnesarchus, practised inquiry beyond all other men, and in this selection of his writings made himself a wisdom of his own, showing much learning but poor workmanship." 

οὕτω δ᾽ εἶπεν, ἐπειδήπερ ἐναρχόμενος ὁ Πυθαγόρας τοῦ Φυσικοῦ συγγράμματος λέγει ὧδε: 

The occasion of this remark was the opening words of Pythagoras's treatise On Nature, namely, 

"οὐ μὰ τὸν ἀέρα, τὸν ἀναπνέω, οὐ μὰ τὸ ὕδωρ, τὸ πίνω, οὔ κοτ᾽ οἴσω [8](##b-g##8) ψόγον περὶ τοῦ λόγου τοῦδε." 

"Nay, I swear by the air I breathe, I swear by the water I drink, I will never suffer censure on account of this work." 

γέγραπται δὲ τῷ Πυθαγόρᾳ συγγράμματα τρία, Παιδευτικόν, Πολιτικόν, Φυσικόν: 9 

Pythagoras in fact wrote three books. On Education, On Statesmanship, and On Nature. 

### 7 
τὸ δὲ φερόμενον ὡς Πυθαγόρου Λύσιδός ἐστι τοῦ Ταραντίνου Πυθαγορικοῦ, φυγόντος εἰς Θήβας καὶ Ἐπαμεινώνδα καθηγησαμένου. 

But the book which passes as the work of Pythagoras is by Lysis of Tarentum[f10](##fn#10), a Pythagorean, who fled to Thebes and taught [Epaminondas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epaminondas).[5](##b-e##5) 

φησὶ δ᾽ Ἡρακλείδης ὁ τοῦ Σαραπίωνος ἐν τῇ Σωτίωνος ἐπιτομῇ γεγραφέναι αὐτὸν καὶ Περὶ τοῦ ὅλου ἐν ἔπεσιν, δεύτερον τὸν Ἱερὸν λόγον, οὗ ἡ ἀρχή:

Heraclides, the son of Serapion[f11](##fn#11), in his [Epitome of Sotion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclides_Lembus#Works), says that he also wrote a poem On the Universe, and secondly the Sacred Poem which begins :

ὦ νέοι, ἀλλὰ σέβεσθε μεθ᾽ ἡσυχίης τάδε πάντα:

Young men, come reverence in quietude
All these my words ;

τρίτον Περὶ ψυχῆς, τέταρτον Περὶ εὐσεβείας, πέμπτον Ἡλοθαλῆ τὸν Ἐπιχάρμου τοῦ Κῴου πατέρα, ἕκτον Κρότωνα καὶ ἄλλους. 

thirdly On the Soul, fourthly Of Piety, fifthly [Helothales the Father of Epicharmus of Cos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicharmus_of_Kos#Life), sixthly Croton, and other works as well. 

τὸν δὲ Μυστικὸν λόγον Ἱππάσου φησὶν εἶναι, γεγραμμένον ἐπὶ διαβολῇ Πυθαγόρου, πολλοὺς δὲ καὶ ὑπὸ Ἄστωνος τοῦ Κροτωνιάτου γραφέντας ἀνατεθῆναι Πυθαγόρᾳ. 10 

The same authority says that the poem On the Mysteries was written by Hippasus[f13](##fn#13) to defame Pythagoras, and that many others written by Aston of Croton were ascribed to Pythagoras. 
### 8 
φησὶ δὲ καὶ Ἀριστόξενος τὰ πλεῖστα τῶν ἠθικῶν δογμάτων λαβεῖν τὸν Πυθαγόραν παρὰ Θεμιστοκλείας τῆς ἐν Δελφοῖς. 

Aristoxenus[f2](##fn#2) says that Pythagoras got most of his moral doctrines from the Delphic priestess [Themistoclea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Themistoclea). 

Ἴων δὲ ὁ Χῖος ἐν τοῖς Τριαγμοῖς φησιν αὐτὸν ἔνια ποιήσαντα ἀνενεγκεῖν εἰς Ὀρφέα. 

According to [Ion of Chios in his Triagmi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_of_Chios#:~:text=Kosmologikos%20is%20probably%20the%20same%20as%20the%20philosophical%20work%2C%20entitled%20Triagmos%20(%CE%A4%CF%81%CE%B9%CE%B1%CE%B3%CE%BC%CF%8C%CF%82)%20or%20Triagmoi%20(%CE%A4%CF%81%CE%B9%CE%B1%CE%B3%CE%BC%CE%BF%CE%AF)%2C%20which%20seems%20to%20have%20been%20a%20treatise%20on%20the%20constitution%20of%20things%20according%20to%20the%20theory%20of%20triads%3B%20the%20few%20surviving%20fragments%20suggesting%20it%20had%20Pythagorean%20leanings.%5B13%5D) he ascribed some poems of his own making to Orpheus.[6](##b-e##6) 

αὐτοῦ λέγουσι καὶ τοὺς Σκοπιάδας, οὗ ἡ ἀρχή, 

They further attribute to him the Scopiads which begins thus :

"Μὴ : : ἀνααίδευ μηδενί." 

Be not shameless, before any man.

Σωσικράτης δ᾽ ἐν Διαδοχαῖς φησιν αὐτὸν ἐρωτηθέντα ὑπὸ Λέοντος τοῦ Φλιασίων τυράννου τίς εἴη, φιλόσοφος, εἰπεῖν. 

[Sosicrates in his Successions of Philosophers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sosicrates) says that, when [Leon the tyrant of Phlius](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_of_Phlius) asked him who he was, he said, "A philosopher,"[7](##b-e#7) 

καὶ τὸν βίον ἐοικέναι πανηγύρει: 

and that he compared life to the Great Games, 

ὡς οὖν εἰς ταύτην οἱ μὲν ἀγωνιούμενοι, οἱ δὲ κατ᾽ ἐμπορίαν, 

where some went to compete for the prize and others went with wares to sell, 

οἱ δέ γε βέλτιστοι ἔρχονται θεαταί, 

but the best as spectators ; 

οὕτως ἐν τῷ βίῳ οἱ μὲν ἀνδραποδώδεις, ἔφη, φύονται δόξης καὶ πλεονεξίας θηραταί, 

for similarly, in life, some grow up with servile natures, greedy for fame and gain, 

οἱ δὲ φιλόσοφοι τῆς ἀληθείας. 

but the philosopher seeks for truth. 

καὶ τάδε μὲν ὧδε.11

Thus much for this part of the subject.

### 9 
Ἐν δὲ τοῖς τρισὶ συγγράμμασι τοῖς προειρημένοις φέρεται Πυθαγόρου τάδε καθολικῶς. 

The contents in general of the aforesaid three treatises of Pythagoras are as follows. 

οὐκ ἐᾷ εὔχεσθαι ὑπὲρ ἑαυτῶν διὰ τὸ μὴ εἰδέναι τὸ συμφέρον. 

He forbids us to pray for ourselves, because we do not know what will help us. 

τὴν μέθην ἓν ἀνθ᾽ ἑνὸς βλάβην καλεῖ καὶ πλησμονὴν πᾶσαν ἀποδοκιμάζει, 

Drinking he calls, in a word, a snare, and he discountenances all excess, 

λέγων μὴ παραβαίνειν μήτε τῶν ποτῶν μήτε τῶν σιτίων μηδένα τὴν συμμετρίαν. 

saying that no one should go beyond due proportion either in drinking or in eating. 

καὶ περὶ ἀφροδισίων δέ φησιν οὕτως: 

Of sexual indulgence, too, he says, 

"Ἀφροδίσια χειμῶνος ποιέεσθαι, μὴ θέρεος: 

"Keep to the winter for sexual pleasures, in summer abstain ; 

φθινοπώρου δὲ καὶ ἦρος κουφότερα, 

they are less harmful in autumn and spring, 

βαρέα δὲ πᾶσαν ὥρην καὶ ἐς ὑγιείην οὐκ ἀγαθά." 

but they are always harmful and not conducive to health." 

ἀλλὰ καί ποτ᾽ ἐρωτηθέντα πότε δεῖ πλησιάζειν εἰπεῖν: 

Asked once when a man should consort with a woman, he replied, 

ὅταν βούλῃ γενέσθαι σωυτοῦ ἀσθενέστερος.12 

"When you want to lose what strength you have."

### 10 
Διαιρεῖται δὲ καὶ τὸν τοῦ ἀνθρώπου βίον οὕτως: 

He divides man's life into four quarters thus : 

"Παῖς εἴκοσι ἔτεα, νεηνίσκος εἴκοσι, νεηνίης εἴκοσι, γέρων εἴκοσι. 

"Twenty years a boy, twenty years a youth, twenty years a young man, twenty years an old man ; 

αἱ δὲ ἡλικίαι πρὸς τὰς ὥρας ὧδε σύμμετροι: 

and these four periods correspond to the four seasons, 

παῖς ἔαρ, νεηνίσκος θέρος, νεηνίης φθινόπωρον, γέρων χειμών." 

the boy to spring, the youth to summer, the young man to autumn, and the old man to winter," 

ἔστι δ᾽ αὐτῷ ὁ μὲν νεηνίσκος μειράκιον, ὁ δὲ νεηνίης ἀνήρ. 

meaning by youth one not yet grown up and by a young man a man of mature age. 

εἶπέ τε πρῶτος, ὥς φησι Τίμαιος, 

According to [Timaeus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timaeus_(historian)), he was the first to say, 

κοινὰ τὰ φίλων εἶναι 

"Friends have all things in common" 

καὶ φιλίαν ἰσότητα. 

and "Friendship is equality" ; 

καὶ αὐτοῦ οἱ μαθηταὶ κατετίθεντο τὰς οὐσίας εἰς ἕν \[ποιούμενοι\]. 

indeed, his disciples did put all their possessions into one common stock. 

πενταετίαν θ᾽ ἡσύχαζον, μόνον τῶν λόγων κατακούοντες καὶ οὐδέπω Πυθαγόραν ὁρῶντες εἰς ὃ δοκιμασθεῖεν: 

For five whole years they had to keep silence, merely listening to his discourses without seeing him, [8](##b-e##8) until they passed an examination, 

τοὐντεῦθεν δ᾽ ἐγίνοντο τῆς οἰκίας αὐτοῦ καὶ τῆς ὄψεως μετεῖχον. 

and thenceforward they were admitted to his house and allowed to see him. 

ἀπείχοντο δὲ καὶ σοροῦ κυπαρισσίνης 

They would never use coffins of cypress, 

διὰ τὸ τὸ τοῦ Διὸς σκῆπτρον ἐντεῦθεν πεποιῆσθαι, 

because the sceptre of Zeus was made from it, 

ὥς φησιν Ἕρμιππος ἐν δευτέρῳ Περὶ Πυθαγόρου.13 

so we are informed by Hermippus[f1](##fn#1) in his second book On Pythagoras.
### 11 
Καὶ γὰρ καὶ σεμνοπρεπέστατος λέγεται γενέσθαι 

Indeed, his bearing is said to have been most dignified, 

καὶ οἱ μαθηταὶ δόξαν εἶχον περὶ αὐτοῦ ὡς εἴη Ἀπόλλων ἐξ Ὑπερβορέων ἀφιγμένος. 

and his disciples held the opinion about him that he was Apollo come down from the far north. 

λόγος δέ ποτ᾽ αὐτοῦ παραγυμνωθέντος τὸν μηρὸν ὀφθῆναι χρυσοῦν: 

There is a story that once, when he was disrobed, his thigh was seen to be of gold ; 

καὶ ὅτι Νέσσος ὁ ποταμὸς διαβαίνοντα αὐτὸν προσαγορεύσαι πολὺς ἦν ὁ φάσκων. 

and when he crossed the river Nessus, quite a number of people said they heard it welcome him. 

Τίμαιός τέ φησιν ἐν δεκάτῃ Ἱστοριῶν λέγειν αὐτὸν 

According to Timaeus in the tenth book of his History, he remarked that 

τὰς συνοικούσας ἀνδράσι θεῶν ἔχειν ὀνόματα, Κόρας, Νύμφας, εἶτα Μητέρας καλουμένας. 

the consorts of men bore divine names, being called first Virgins, then Brides, and then Mothers.[9](##b-e##9)

τοῦτον καὶ γεωμετρίαν ἐπὶ πέρας ἀγαγεῖν, 

He it was who brought geometry to perfection, 

Μοίριδος πρώτου εὑρόντος τὰς ἀρχὰς τῶν στοιχείων αὐτῆς, 

while it was [Moeris](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104%3Aentry%3Dmoeris-bio-1) who first discovered the beginnings of the elements of geometry : 

ὥς φησιν Ἀντικλείδης ἐν δευτέρῳ Περὶ Ἀλεξάνδρου. 14 

[Anticlides in his second book On Alexander](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticlides)[10](##b-e##10) affirms this, 
### 12 
μάλιστα δὲ σχολάσαι τὸν Πυθαγόραν περὶ τὸ ἀριθμητικὸν εἶδος αὐτῆς: 

and further that Pythagoras spent most of his time upon the arithmetical aspect of geometry ; 

τόν τε κανόνα τὸν ἐκ μιᾶς χορδῆς εὑρεῖν. 

he also discovered the musical intervals on the monochord. 

οὐκ ἠμέλησε δ᾽ οὐδ᾽ ἰατρικῆς. 

Nor did he neglect even medicine. 

φησὶ δ᾽ Ἀπολλόδωρος ὁ λογιστικὸς 

We are told by [Apollodorus the calculator](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotenuse#eEtymology) 

ἑκατόμβην θῦσαι αὐτόν, εὑρόντα ὅτι τοῦ ὀρθογωνίου τριγώνου ἡ ὑποτείνουσα πλευρὰ ἴσον δύναται ταῖς περιεχούσαις. 

that he offered a sacrifice of oxen on finding that in a right-angled triangle the square on the hypotenuse is equal to the squares on the sides containing the right angle. 

καὶ ἔστιν ἐπίγραμμα οὕτως ἔχον:

And there is an epigram running as follows[11](##b-e##11) :

ἡνίκα Πυθαγόρης τὸ περικλεὲς εὕρετο γράμμα, κεῖν᾽ ἐφ᾽ ὅτῳ κλεινὴν ἤγαγε βουθυσίην.

What time Pythagoras that famed figure found,
For which the noble offering he brought.

Λέγεται δὲ καὶ πρῶτος κρέασιν ἀσκῆσαι ἀθλητάς, 

He is also said to have been the first to diet athletes on meat, 

καὶ πρῶτόν γ᾽ Εὐρυμένην, 

trying first with Eurymenes[12](##b-e##12)-- 

καθά φησι Φαβωρῖνος ἐν τρίτῳ τῶν Ἀπομνημονευμάτων, 

so we learn from Favorinus[f15](##fn#15) in the third book of his [Memorabilia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favorinus#:~:text=memoirs)--

τῶν πρότερον ἰσχάσι ξηραῖς καὶ τυροῖς ὑγροῖς, ἀλλὰ καὶ πυροῖς σωμασκούντων αὐτούς, 

whereas in former times they had trained on dried figs, on butter,13 and even on wheatmeal, 

καθάπερ ὁ αὐτὸς Φαβωρῖνος ἐν ὀγδόῃ Παντοδαπῆς ἱστορίας φησίν.15 

as we are told by the same Favorinus in the eighth book of his [Miscellaneous History](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favorinus#:~:text=miscellaneous).
### 13 
οἱ δὲ Πυθαγόραν ἀλείπτην τινὰ τοῦτον σιτίσαι τὸν τρόπον, μὴ τοῦτον. 

Some say it was a certain trainer named Pythagoras who instituted this diet,[14](##b-e##14) and not our Pythagoras, 

τοῦτον γὰρ καὶ τὸ φονεύειν ἀπαγορεύειν, μὴ ὅτι γεύεσθαι τῶν ζῴων κοινὸν δίκαιον ἡμῖν ἐχόντων ψυχῆς. 

who forbade even the killing, let alone the eating, of animals which share with us the privilege of having a soul. 

καὶ τόδε μὲν ἦν τὸ πρόσχημα: 

This was the excuse put forward ; 

τὸ δ᾽ ἀληθὲς τῶν ἐμψύχων ἀπηγόρευεν ἅπτεσθαι συνασκῶν καὶ συνεθίζων εἰς εὐκολίαν βίου τοὺς ἀνθρώπους, 

but his real reason for forbidding animal diet was to practise people and accustom them to simplicity of life, 

ὥστε εὐπορίστους αὐτοῖς εἶναι τὰς τροφάς, 

so that they could live on things easily procurable, 

ἄπυρα προσφερομένοις καὶ λιτὸν ὕδωρ πίνουσιν: 

spreading their tables with uncooked foods and drinking pure water only, 

ἐντεῦθεν γὰρ καὶ σώματος ὑγίειαν καὶ ψυχῆς ὀξύτητα περιγίνεσθαι. 

for this was the way to a healthy body and a keen mind. 

ἀμέλει καὶ βωμὸν προσκυνῆσαι μόνον ἐν Δήλῳ τὸν Ἀπόλλωνος τοῦ γενέτορος, ὅς ἐστιν ὄπισθεν τοῦ Κερατίνου, 

Of course the only altar at which he worshipped was that of Apollo the Giver of Life, behind the Altar of Horns at Delos, 

διὰ τὸ πυροὺς καὶ κριθὰς καὶ πόπανα μόνα τίθεσθαι ἐπ᾽ αὐτοῦ ἄνευ πυρός, 

for thereon were placed flour and meal and cakes, without the use of fire, 

ἱερεῖον δὲ μηδέν, 

and there was no animal victim, 

ὥς φησιν Ἀριστοτέλης ἐν Δηλίων πολιτείᾳ.16 

as we are told by Aristotle in his Constitution of Delos.
### 14 
Πρῶτόν τέ φασι τοῦτον ἀποφῆναι τὴν ψυχὴν κύκολον ἀνάγκης ἀμείβουσαν ἄλλοτ᾽ ἄλλοις ἐνδεῖσθαι ζῴοις: 

He was the first, they say, to declare that the soul, bound now in this creature, now in that, thus goes on a round ordained of necessity. 

καὶ πρῶτον εἰς τοὺς Ἕλληνας μέτρα καὶ σταθμὰ εἰσηγήσασθαι, καθά φησιν Ἀριστόξενος ὁ μουσικός: 

He too, according to Aristoxenus[f2](#f#2) the musician, was the first to introduce weights and measures into Greece. 

πρῶτόν τε Ἕσπερον καὶ Φωσφόρον τὸν αὐτὸν εἰπεῖν, ὥς φησι Παρμενίδης.[17](##b-g##17) 

It was he who first declared that the Evening and Morning Stars are the same, as Parmenides maintains.[15](##b-e##15) 

οὕτω δ᾽ ἐθαυμάσθη ὥστ᾽ ἔλεγον τοὺς γνωρίμους αὐτοῦ μάντιας θεῶ φωνᾶς, 

So greatly was he admired that his disciples used to be called "prophets to declare the voice of God," 

ἀλλὰ καὶ αὐτὸς ἐν τῇ γραφῇ φησι 

besides which he himself says in a written work that 

δι᾽ ἑπτὰ καὶ διηκοσίων ἐτέων ἐξ ἀΐδεω παραγεγενῆσθαι ἐς ἀνθρώπους. 

"after two hundred and seven years in Hades he has returned to the land of the living." 

τοιγὰρ καὶ προσεκαρτέρουν αὐτῷ καὶ τῶν λόγων ἕνεκα προσῄεσαν καὶ Λευκανοὶ καὶ Πευκέτιοι Μεσσάπιοί τε καὶ Ῥωμαῖοι.18 

Thus it was that they remained his staunch adherents, and men came to hear his words from afar, among them Lucanians, Peucetians, Messapians and Romans.

### 15 
Μέχρι δὲ Φιλολάου οὐκ ἦν τι γνῶναι Πυθαγόρειον δόγμα: 

Down to the time of Philolaus[f6](##fn#6) it was not possible to acquire knowledge of any Pythagorean doctrine, 

οὗτος δὲ μόνος ἐξήνεγκε τὰ διαβόητα τρία βιβλία, ἃ Πλάτων ἐπέστειλεν ἑκατὸν μνῶν ὠνηθῆναι. 

and Philolaus alone brought out those three celebrated books which Plato sent a hundred minas to purchase. 

τῶν θ᾽ ἑξακοσίων οὐκ ἐλάττους ἐπὶ τὴν νυκτερινὴν ἀκρόασιν ἀπήντων αὐτοῦ: 

Not less than six hundred persons went to his evening lectures ; 

καὶ εἴ τινες ἀξιωθεῖεν αὐτὸν θεάσασθαι, ἔγραφον πρὸς τοὺς οἰκείους ὡς μεγάλου τινὸς τετυχηκότες. 

and those who were privileged to see him wrote to their friends congratulating themselves on a great piece of good fortune. 

Μεταποντῖνοί γε μὴν τὴν μὲν οἰκίαν αὐτοῦ Δήμητρος ἱερὸν ἐκάλουν, τὸν στενωπὸν δὲ μουσεῖον, 

Moreover, the Metapontines named his house the Temple of Demeter[f7](##fn) and his porch the Museum, 

ὥς φησι Φαβωρῖνος ἐν Παντοδαπαῖς ἱστορίαις: 

so we learn from Favorinus[f15](##fn#15) in his [Miscellaneous History](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favorinus#:~:text=miscellaneous).[16](##b-e##16) 

ἔλεγόν τε καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι Πυθαγόρειοι μὴ εἶναι πρὸς πάντας πάντα ῥητά, 

And the rest of the Pythagoreans used to say that not all his doctrines were for all men to hear, 

ὥς φησιν Ἀριστόξενος ἐν δεκάτῃ Παιδευτικῶν νόμων: 19 

our authority for this being Aristoxenus[f2](##fn#2) in the tenth book of his Rules of Pedagogy, 
### 16 
ἔνθα καὶ Ξενόφιλον τὸν Πυθαγορικόν, ἐρωτηθέντα πῶς ἂν μάλιστα τὸν υἱὸν παιδεύσειεν, εἰπεῖν, 

where we are also told that one of the school, Xenophilus[f8](##fn#8) by name, asked by some one how he could best educate his son, replied, 

εἰ πόλεως εὐνομουμένης γενηθείη. 

"By making him the citizen of a well-governed state." 

ἄλλους τε πολλοὺς κατὰ τὴν Ἰταλίαν ἀπεργάσασθαι καλούς τε κἀγαθοὺς ἄνδρας, ἀτὰρ καὶ Ζάλευκον καὶ Χαρώνδαν τοὺς νομοθέτας: 

Throughout Italy Pythagoras made many into good men and true, men too of note like the lawgivers [Zaleucus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaleucus) and [Charondas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charondas) ; 

ἱκανός τε γὰρ ἦν φιλίας ἐργάτης τά τ᾽ ἄλλα καὶ εἴ τινα πύθοιτο τῶν συμβόλων αὐτοῦ κεκοινωνηκότα, εὐθύς τε προσηταιρίζετο καὶ φίλον κατεσκεύαζεν.20 

for he had a great gift for friendship, and especially, when he found his own watchwords adopted by anyone, he would immediately take to that man and make a friend of him.
### 17 
Ἦν δ᾽ αὐτῷ τὰ σύμβολα τάδε: 

The following were his watchwords or precepts : 

πῦρ μαχαίρᾳ μὴ σκαλεύειν, 

don't stir the fire with a knife, 

ζυγὸν μὴ ὑπερβαίνειν, 

don't step over the beam of a balance, 

ἐπὶ χοίνικος μὴ καθίζειν, 

don't sit down on your bushel,[17](##b-e##17) 

καρδίην μὴ ἐσθίειν, 

don't eat your heart, 

φορτίον μὴ συγκαθαιρεῖν, ουνεπιτιθέναι δέ, 

don't help a man off with a load but help him on, 

τὰ στρώματα ἀεὶ συνδεδεμένα ἔχειν, 

always roll your bed-clothes up, 

ἐν δακτυλίῳ εἰκόνα θεοῦ μὴ περιφέρειν, 

don't put God's image on the circle of a ring, 

χύτρας ἴχνος συγχεῖν ἐν τῇ τέφρᾳ,

don't leave the pan's imprint on the ashes, 

δᾳδίῳ θᾶκον μὴ ὀμόργνυσθαι, 

don't wipe up a mess with a torch, 

πρὸς ἥλιον τετραμμένον μὴ ὀμίχειν, 

don't commit a nuisance towards the sun, 

τὰς λεωφόρους μὴ βαδίζειν, 

don't walk the highway, 

μὴ ῥᾳδίως δεξιὰν ἐμβάλλειν, 

don't shake hands too eagerly, 

ὁμωροφίους χελιδόνας μὴ ἔχειν, 

don't have swallows under your own roof, 

γαμψώνυχα μὴ τρέφειν, 

don't keep birds with hooked claws, 

ἀπονυχίσμασι καὶ κουραῖς μὴ ἐπουρεῖν μηδὲ ἐφίστασθαι, 

don't make water on nor stand upon your nail-and hair-trimmings, 

ὀξεῖαν μάχαιραν ἀποστρέφειν, 

turn the sharp blade away, 

ἀποδημοῦντα ἐπὶ τοῖς ὅροις ἀνεπιστρεπτεῖν.21 

when you go abroad don't turn round at the frontier.
### 18 


This is what they meant. 

Ἤθελε δ᾽ αὐτῷ τὸ μὲν πῦρ μαχαίρᾳ μὴ σκαλεύειν δυναστῶν ὀργὴν καὶ οἰδοῦντα θυμὸν μὴ κινεῖν. 

Don't stir the fire with a knife : don't stir the passions or the swelling pride of the great. 

τὸ δὲ ζυγὸν μὴ ὑπερβαίνειν, τουτέστι τὸ ἴσον καὶ δίκαιον μὴ ὑπερβαίνειν. 

Don't step over the beam of a balance : don't overstep the bounds of equity and justice. 

ἐπί τε χοίνικος μὴ καθίζειν ἐν ἴσῳ τοῦ ἐνεστῶτος φροντίδα ποιεῖσθαι καὶ τοῦ μέλλοντος: 

Don't sit down on your bushel : have the same care of to-day and the future, 

ἡ γὰρ χοῖνιξ ἡμερησία τροφή. 

a bushel being the day's ration. 

διὰ δὲ τοῦ καρδίαν μὴ ἐσθίειν ἐδήλου μὴ τὴν ψυχὴν ἀνίαις καὶ λύπαις κατατήκειν. 

By not eating your heart he meant not wasting your life in troubles and pains. 

διὰ δὲ τοῦ εἰς ἀποδημίαν βαδίζοντα μὴ ἐπιστρέφεσθαι παρῄνει τοῖς ἀπαλλαττομένοις τοῦ βίου μὴ ἐπιθυμητικῶς ἔχειν τοῦ ζῆν μηδ᾽ ὑπὸ τῶν ἐνταῦθα ἡδονῶν ἐπάγεσθαι. 

By saying do not turn round when you go abroad, he meant to advise those who are departing this life not to set their hearts' desire on living nor to be too much attracted by the pleasures of this life. 

καὶ τὰ ἄλλα πρὸς ταῦτα λοιπόν ἐστιν ἐκλαμβάνειν, ἵνα μὴ παρέλκωμεν.22 

The explanations of the rest are similar and would take too long to set out.
### 19 
Παντὸς δὲ μᾶλλον ἀπηγόρευε μήτ᾽ ἐρυθῖνον ἐσθίειν μήτε μελάνουρον, καρδίας τ᾽ ἀπέχεσθαι καὶ κυάμων: Ἀριστοτέλης δέ φησι καὶ μήτρας καὶ τρίγλης ἐνίοτε. 

Above all, he forbade as food red mullet and blacktail, and he enjoined abstinence from the hearts of animals and from beans, and sometimes, according to Aristotle, even from paunch and gurnard. 

αὐτὸν δ᾽ ἀρκεῖσθαι μέλιτι μόνῳ φασί τινες ἢ κηρίῳ ἢ ἄρτῳ, οἴνου δὲ μεθ᾽ ἡμέραν μὴ γεύεσθαι: 
ὄψῳ τε τὰ πολλὰ λαχάνοις ἑφθοῖς τε καὶ ὠμοῖς, τοῖς δὲ θαλαττίοις σπανίως. 

Some say that he contented himself with just some honey or a honeycomb or bread, never touching wine in the daytime, and with greens boiled or raw for dainties, and fish but rarely. 

στολὴ δ᾽ αὐτῷ λευκή, καθαρά, καὶ στρώματα λευκὰ ἐξ ἐρίων: 

His robe was white and spotless, his quilts of white wool, 

τὰ γὰρ λινᾶ οὔπω εἰς ἐκείνους ἀφῖκτο τοὺς τόπους. 

for linen had not yet reached those parts. 

οὐδέποτ᾽ ἐγνώσθη οὔτε διαχωρῶν οὔτε ἀφροδισιάζων οὔτε μεθυσθείς. 23 

He was never known to over-eat, to behave loosely, or to be drunk. 
### 20 
ἀπείχετο καὶ γέλωτος καὶ πάσης ἀρεσκείας οἷον σκωμμάτων καὶ διηγημάτων φορτικῶν. 

He would avoid laughter and all pandering to tastes such as in- sulting jests and vulgar tales. 

ὀργιζόμενός τ᾽ οὔτε οἰκέτην ἐκόλαζεν οὔτ᾽ ἐλεύθερον οὐδένα. 

He would punish neither slave nor free man in anger. 

ἐκάλει δὲ τὸ νουθετεῖν πεδαρτᾶν. 

Admonition he used to call "setting right." 

μαντικῇ τ᾽ ἐχρῆτο τῇ διὰ τῶν κλῃδόνων τε καὶ οἰωνῶν, ἥκιστα δὲ τῇ διὰ τῶν ἐμπύρων, ἔξω τῆς διὰ λιβάνου. 

He used to practise divination by sounds or voices and by auguries, never by burnt-offerings, beyond frankincense. 

θυσίαις τε ἐχρῆτο ἀψύχοις, οἱ δέ φασιν, ὅτι ἀλέκτορσι μόνον καὶ ἐρίφοις γαλαθηνοῖς καὶ τοῖς λεγομένοις ἁπαλίαις, ἥκιστα δὲ ἄρνασιν. 

The offerings he made were always inanimate ; though some say that he would offer cocks, sucking goats and porkers, as they are called, but lambs never. 

ὅ γε μὴν Ἀριστόξενος πάντα μὲν τἄλλα συγχωρεῖν αὐτὸν ἐσθίειν ἔμψυχα, μόνον δ᾽ ἀπέχεσθαι βοὸς ἀροτῆρος καὶ κριοῦ.24 

However, Aristoxenus [f2](##fn#2)has it that he consented to the eating of all other animals, and only abstained from ploughing oxen and rams.

### 21 
Ὁ δ᾽ αὐτός φησιν, ὡς προείρηται, καὶ τὰ δόγματα λαβεῖν αὐτὸν παρὰ τῆς ἐν Δελφοῖς Θεμιστοκλείας. 

The same authority, as we have seen, asserts that Pythagoras took his doctrines from the Delphic priestess Themistoclea. 

φησὶ δ᾽ Ἱερώνυμος κατελθόντα αὐτὸν εἰς ᾄδου τὴν μὲν Ἡσιόδου ψυχὴν ἰδεῖν πρὸς κίονι χαλκῷ δεδεμένην καὶ τρίζουσαν, τὴν δ᾽ Ὁμήρου κρεμαμένην ἀπὸ δένδρου καὶ ὄφεις περὶ αὐτὴν ἀνθ᾽ ὧν εἶπον περὶ θεῶν, 

[Hieronymus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hieronymus_of_Rhodes), however, says that, when he had descended into Hades, he saw the soul of Hesiod bound fast to a brazen pillar and gibbering, and the soul of Homer hung on a tree with serpents writhing about it, this being their punishment for what they had said about the gods ; 

κολαζομένους δὲ καὶ τοὺς μὴ θέλοντας συνεῖναι ταῖς ἑαυτῶν γυναιξί: 

he also saw under torture those who would not remain faithful to their wives. 

καὶ δὴ καὶ διὰ τοῦτο τιμηθῆναι ὑπὸ τῶν ἐν Κρότωνι. 

This, says our authority, is why he was honoured by the people of Croton. 

φησὶ δ᾽ Ἀρίστιππος ὁ Κυρηναῖος ἐν τῷ Περὶ φυσιολόγων Πυθαγόραν αὐτὸν ὀνομασθῆναι ὅτι τὴν ἀλήθειαν ἠγόρευεν οὐχ ἧττον τοῦ Πυθίου.25 

[Aristippus of Cyrene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristippus_of_Cyrene) affirms in his work On the Physicists that he was named Pythagoras because he uttered the truth as infallibly as did the Pythian oracle.[18](##b-e##18)
### 22 
Λέγεται παρεγγυᾶν αὐτὸν ἑκάστοτε τοῖς μαθηταῖς 

He is said to have advised his disciples as follows : 

τάδε λέγειν εἰς τὸν οἶκον εἰσιοῦσι, πῆ παρέβην; 

Always to say on entering their own doors :

τί δ᾽ ἔρεξα; τί μοι δέον οὐκ ἐτελέσθη;

Where did I trespass? What did I achieve?
And unfulfilled what duties did I leave?

σφάγιά τε θεοῖς προσφέρειν κωλύειν, μόνον δὲ τὸν ἀναίμακτον βωμὸν προσκυνεῖν. 

Not to let victims be brought for sacrifice to the gods, and to worship only at the altar unstained with blood. 

μηδ᾽ ὀμνύναι θεούς: ἀσκεῖν γὰρ αὑτὸν δεῖν ἀξιόπιστον παρέχειν.

Not to call the gods to witness, man's duty being rather to strive to make his own word carry conviction. 

τούς τε πρεσβυτέρους τιμᾶν, τὸ προηγούμενον τῷ χρόνῳ τιμιώτερον ἡγουμένους: 

To honour their elders, on the principle that precedence in time gives a greater title to respect ; 

ὡς ἐν κόσμῳ μὲν ἀνατολὴν δύσεως, ἐν βίῳ δ᾽ ἀρχὴν τελευτῆς, ἐν ζωῇ δὲ γένεσιν φθορᾶς. 26 

for as in the world sunrise comes before sunset, so in human life the beginning before the end, and in all organic life birth precedes death. 
### 23 
καὶ θεοὺς μὲν δαιμόνων προτιμᾶν, ἥρωας δ᾽ ἀνθρώπων, ἀνθρώπων δὲ μάλιστα τοὺς γονέας. 

And he further bade them to honour gods before demi-gods, heroes before men, and first among men their parents ; 

ἀλλήλοις θ᾽ ὁμιλεῖν, ὡς τοὺς μὲν φίλους ἐχθροὺς μὴ ποιῆσαι, τοὺς δ᾽ ἐχθροὺς φίλους ἐργάσασθαι. 

and so to behave one to another as not to make friends into enemies, but to turn enemies into friends. 

ἴδιόν τε μηδὲν ἡγεῖσθαι. 

To deem nothing their own. 

νόμῳ βοηθεῖν, ἀνομίᾳ πολεμεῖν: 

To support the law, to wage war on lawlessness. 

φυτὸν ἥμερον μήτε φθίνειν μήτε σίνεσθαι, ἀλλὰ μηδὲ ζῷον ὃ μὴ βλάπτει ἀνθρώπους. 

Never to kill or injure trees that are not wild, nor even any animal that does not injure man. 

αἰδῶ καὶ εὐλάβειαν εἶναι μήτε γέλωτι κατέχεσθαι μήτε σκυθρωπάζειν. 

That it is seemly and advisable neither to give way to unbridled laughter nor to wear sullen looks. 

φεύγειν σαρκῶν πλεονασμόν, ὁδοιπορίης ἄνεσιν καὶ ἐπίτασιν ποιεῖσθαι, μνήμην ἀσκεῖν, ἐν ὀργῇ μήτε τι λέγειν μήτε πράσσειν, μαντικὴν πᾶσαν [27](#bg##27) τιμᾶν, 28 

To avoid excess of flesh, on a journey to let exertion and slackening alternate, to train the memory, in wrath to restrain hand and tongue, to respect all divination, 
### 24 
ᾠδαῖς χρῆσθαι πρὸς λύραν ὕμνῳ τε θεῶν καὶ ἀνδρῶν ἀγαθῶν εὔλογον χάριν ἔχειν. 

to sing to the lyre and by hymns to show due gratitude to gods and to good men. 

τῶν δὲ κυάμων ἀπέχεσθαι διὰ τὸ πνευματώδεις ὄντας μάλιστα μετέχειν τοῦ ψυχικοῦ: 

To abstain from beans because they are flatulent and partake most of the breath of life ; 

καὶ ἄλλως κοσμιωτέρας ἀπεργάζεσθαι τὰς γαστέρας, μὴ παραληφθέντας. 

and besides, it is better for the stomach if they are not taken, 

καὶ διὰ τοῦτο καὶ τὰς καθ᾽ ὕπνους φαντασίας λείας καὶ ἀταράχους ἀποτελεῖν.

and this again will make our dreams in sleep smooth and untroubled.

Φησὶ δ᾽ ὁ Ἀλέξανδρος ἐν Ταῖς τῶν φιλοσόφων διαδοχαῖς καὶ ταῦτα εὑρηκέναι ἐν Πυθαγορικοῖς ὑπομνήμασιν. 29 

Alexander[f9](#f#9) in his Successions of Philosophers says that he found in the Pythagorean memoirs the following tenets as well.19 
### 25 
ἀρχὴν μὲν ἁπάντων μονάδα: 

The principle of all things is the monad or unit ; 

ἐκ δὲ τῆς μονάδος ἀόριστον δυάδα ὡς ἂν ὕλην τῇ μονάδι αἰτίῳ ὄντι ὑποστῆναι: 

arising from this monad the undefined dyad or two serves as material substratum to the monad, which is cause ; 

ἐκ δὲ τῆς μονάδος καὶ τῆς ἀορίστου δυάδος τοὺς ἀριθμούς: ἐκ δὲ τῶν ἀριθμῶν τὰ σημεῖα: ἐκ δὲ τούτων τὰς γραμμάς, ἐξ ὧν τὰ ἐπίπεδα σχήματα: ἐκ δὲ τῶν ἐπιπέδων τὰ στερεὰ σχήματα: ἐκ δὲ τούτων τὰ αἰσθητὰ σώματα, ὧν καὶ τὰ στοιχεῖα εἶναι τέτταρα, πῦρ, ὕδωρ, γῆν, ἀέρα: 

from the monad and the undefined dyad spring numbers ; from numbers, points ; from points, lines ; from lines, plane figures ; from plane figures, solid figures ; from solid figures, sensible bodies, the elements of which are four, fire, water, earth and air; 

μεταβάλλειν δὲ καὶ τρέπεσθαι δι᾽ ὅλων, καὶ γίνεσθαι ἐξ αὐτῶν κόσμον ἔμψυχον, νοερόν, σφαιροειδῆ, μέσην περιέχοντα τὴν γῆν καὶ αὐτὴν σφαιροειδῆ καὶ περιοικουμένην. 30 

these elements interchange and turn into one another completely, and combine to produce a universe animate, intelligent, spherical, with the earth at its centre, the earth itself too being spherical and inhabited round about. 

### 26 
εἶναι δὲ καὶ ἀντίποδας καὶ τὰ ἡμῖν κάτω ἐκείνοις ἄνω. 

There are also antipodes, and our "down" is their "up." 

ἰσόμοιρά τ᾽ εἶναι ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ φῶς καὶ σκότος, καὶ θερμὸν καὶ ψυχρόν, καὶ ξηρὸν καὶ ὑγρόν: 

Light and darkness have equal part[20](##b-e##20) in the universe, so have hot and cold, and dry and moist ; 

ὧν κατ᾽ ἐπικράτειαν θερμοῦ μὲν θέρος γίνεσθαι, ψυχροῦ δὲ χειμῶνα, ξηροῦ δ᾽ ἔαρ, καὶ ὑγροῦ φθινόπωρον. 

and of these, if hot preponderates, we have summer; if cold, winter; if dry, spring; if moist, late autumn. 

ἐὰν δὲ ἰσομοιρῇ, τὰ κάλλιστα εἶναι τοῦ ἔτους, οὗ τὸ μὲν θάλλον ἔαρ ὑγιεινόν, τὸ δὲ φθίνον φθινόπωρον νοσερόν. 

If all are in equilibrium, we have the best periods of the year, of which the freshness of spring constitutes the healthy season, and the decay of late autumn the unhealthy. 

ἀλλὰ καὶ τῆς ἡμέρας θάλλειν μὲν τὴν ἕω, φθίνειν δὲ τὴν ἑσπέραν: ὅθεν καὶ νοσερωτέραν εἶναι. 

So too, in the day, freshness belongs to the morning, and decay to the evening, which is therefore more unhealthy. 

τόν τε περὶ τὴν γῆν ἀέρα ἄσειστον καὶ νοσερὸν καὶ τὰ ἐν αὐτῷ πάντα θνητά: 

The air about the earth is stagnant and unwholesome, and all within it is mortal; 

τὸν δὲ ἀνωτάτω ἀεικίνητόν τ᾽ εἶναι καὶ καθαρὸν καὶ ὑγιᾶ καὶ πάντα τὰ ἐν αὐτῷ ἀθάνατα καὶ διὰ τοῦτο θεῖα. 31 

but the uppermost air is ever-moved and pure and healthy, and all within it is immortal and consequently divine. 
### 27 
ἥλιόν τε καὶ σελήνην καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους ἀστέρας εἶναι θεούς: 

The sun, the moon, and the other stars are gods; 

ἐπικρατεῖν γὰρ τὸ θερμὸν ἐν αὐτοῖς, ὅπερ ἐστὶ ζωῆς αἴτιον. 

for, in them, there is a preponderance of heat, and heat is the cause of life. 

τήν τε σελήνην λάμπεσθαι ὑφ᾽ ἡλίου. 

The moon is illumined by the sun. 

καὶ ἀνθρώποις εἶναι πρὸς θεοὺς συγγένειαν, κατὰ τὸ μετέχειν ἄνθρωπον θερμοῦ: 

Gods and men are akin, inasmuch as man partakes of heat ; 

διὸ καὶ προνοεῖσθαι τὸν θεὸν ἡμῶν. 

therefore God takes thought for man. 

εἱμαρμένην τε τῶν ὅλων καὶ κατὰ μέρος αἰτίαν εἶναι τῆς διοικήσεως. 

Fate is the cause of things being thus ordered both as a whole and separately. 

διήκειν τ᾽ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἡλίου ἀκτῖνα διὰ τοῦ αἰθέρος τοῦ τε ψυχροῦ καὶ παχέος.

The sun's ray penetrates through the aether, whether cold or dense--

καλοῦσι δὲ τὸν μὲν ἀέρα ψυχρὸν αἰθέρα, τὴν δὲ θάλασσαν καὶ τὸ ὑγρὸν παχὺν αἰθέρα. 

the air they call cold aether, and the sea and moisture dense aether --

ταύτην δὲ τὴν ἀκτῖνα καὶ εἰς τὰ βένθη δύεσθαι καὶ διὰ τοῦτο ζωοποιεῖν πάντα. 32 

and this ray descends even to the depths and for this reason quickens all things. 
### 28 
καὶ ζῆν μὲν πάνθ᾽ ὅσα μετέχει τοῦ θερμοῦ: διὸ καὶ τὰ φυτὰ ζῷα εἶναι: 

All things live which partake of heat--this is why plants are living things --

ψυχὴν μέντοι μὴ ἔχειν πάντα. εἶναι δὲ τὴν ψυχὴν ἀπόσπασμα αἰθέρος καὶ τοῦ θερμοῦ καὶ τοῦ ψυχροῦ, τῷ συμμετέχειν ψυχροῦ αἰθέρος. 

but all have not soul, which is a detached part of aether, partly the hot and partly the cold, for it partakes of cold aether too. 

διαφέρειν τε ψυχὴν ζωῆς: ἀθάνατόν τ᾽ εἶναι αὐτήν, ἐπειδήπερ καὶ τὸ ἀφ᾽ οὗ ἀπέσπασται ἀθάνατόν ἐστι. 

Soul is distinct from life; it is immortal, since that from which it is detached is immortal. 

τὰ δὲ ζῷα γεννᾶσθαι ἐξ ἀλλήλων ἀπὸ σπερμάτων, 

Living creatures are reproduced from one another by germination; 

τὴν δ᾽ ἐκ γῆς γένεσιν ἀδύνατον ὑφίστασθαι. 

there is no such thing as spontaneous generation from earth. 

τὸ δὲ σπέρμα εἶναι σταγόνα ἐγκεφάλου περιέχουσαν ἐν ἑαυτῇ θερμὸν ἀτμόν: ταύτην δὲ προσφερομένην τῇ μήτρᾳ ἀπὸ μὲν τοῦ ἐγκεφάλου ἰχῶρα καὶ ὑγρὸν καὶ αἷμα προΐεσθαι, ἐξ ὧν σάρκας τε καὶ νεῦρα καὶ ὀστᾶ καὶ τρίχας καὶ τὸ ὅλον συνίστασθαι σῶμα: 

The germ is a clot of brain containing hot vapour within it; and this, when brought to the womb, throws out, from the brain, ichor, fluid and blood, whence are formed flesh, sinews, bones, hairs, and the whole of the body, 

ἀπὸ δὲ τοῦ ἀτμοῦ ψυχὴν καὶ αἴσθησιν. 33 

while soul and sense come from the vapour within. 
### 29 
μορφοῦσθαι δὲ τὸ μὲν πρῶτον παγὲν ἐν ἡμέραις τεσσαράκοντα, κατὰ δὲ τοὺς τῆς ἁρμονίας λόγους ἐν ἑπτὰ ἢ ἐννέα ἢ δέκα τὸ πλεῖστον μησὶ τελεωθὲν ἀποκυΐσκεσθαι τὸ βρέφος: 

First congealing in about forty days, it receives form and, according to the ratios of "harmony," in seven, nine, or at the most ten, months, the mature child is brought forth. 

ἔχειν δ᾽ ἐν αὑτῷ πάντας τοὺς λόγους τῆς ζωῆς, ὧν εἰρομένων συνέχεσθαι κατὰ τοὺς τῆς ἁρμονίας λόγους, ἑκάστων ἐν τεταγμένοις καιροῖς ἐπιγινομένων. 

It has in it all the relations constituting life, and these, forming a continuous series, keep it together according to the ratios of harmony, each appearing at regulated intervals. 

τήν τ᾽ αἴσθησιν κοινῶς καὶ κατ᾽ εἶδος τὴν ὅρασιν ἀτμόν τιν᾽ εἶναι ἄγαν θερμόν. 

Sense generally, and sight in particular, is a certain unusually hot vapour. 

καὶ διὰ τοῦτο λέγεται δι᾽ ἀέρος ὁρᾶν καὶ δι᾽ ὕδατος: ἀντερείδεσθαι γὰρ τὸ θερμὸν ἀπὸ τοῦ ψυχροῦ. ἐπεί τοι εἰ ψυχρὸς ἦν ὁ ἐν τοῖς ὄμμασιν ἀτμός, διειστήκει ἂν πρὸς τὸν ὅμοιον ἀέρα: 

This is why it is said to see through air and water, because the hot aether is resisted by the cold; for, if the vapour in the eyes had been cold, it would have been dissipated on meeting the air, its like. 

νῦν δὲ : : ἔστιν[34](##b-g##34) ἐν οἷς ἡλίου πύλας καλεῖ τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς.

As it is, in certain \[lines\] he calls the eyes the portals of the sun. 

τὰ δ᾽ αὐτὰ καὶ περὶ τῆς ἀκοῆς καὶ τῶν λοιπῶν αἰσθήσεων δογματίζει.35

His conclusion is the same with regard to hearing and the other senses.
### 30 
Τὴν δ᾽ ἀνθρώπου ψυχὴν διαιρεῖσθαι τριχῆ, εἴς τε νοῦν καὶ φρένας καὶ θυμόν. 

The soul of man, he says, is divided into three parts, intelligence, reason, and passion. 

νοῦν μὲν οὖν καὶ θυμὸν εἶναι καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἄλλοις ζῴοις, φρένας δὲ μόνον ἐν ἀνθρώπῳ. 

Intelligence and passion are possessed by other animals as well, but reason by man alone. 

εἶναι δὲ τὴν ἀρχὴν τῆς ψυχῆς ἀπὸ καρδίας μέχρις ἐγκεφάλου: 

The seat of the soul extends from the heart to the brain; 

καὶ τὸ μὲν ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ μέρος αὐτῆς ὑπάρχειν θυμόν, φρένας δὲ καὶ νοῦν τὰ ἐν τῷ ἐγκεφάλῳ: 

the part of it which is in the heart is passion, while the parts located in the brain are reason and intelligence. 

σταγόνας δ᾽ εἶναι ἀπὸ τούτων τὰς αἰσθήσεις. 

The senses are distillations from these. 

καὶ τὸ μὲν φρόνιμον ἀθάνατον, τὰ δὲ λοιπὰ θνητά. 

Reason is immortal, all else mortal. 

τρέφεσθαί τε τὴν ψυχὴν ἀπὸ τοῦ αἵματος: 

The soul draws nourishment from the blood; 

τοὺς δὲ λόγους ψυχῆς ἀνέμους εἶναι. 

the faculties[21](##b-e##21) of the soul are winds, 

ἀόρατόν τ᾽ εἶναι αὐτὴν καὶ τοὺς λόγους, ἐπεὶ καὶ ὁ αἰθὴρ ἀόρατος.36 

for they as well as the soul are invisible, just as the aether is invisible. 

### 31 
δεσμά τ᾽ εἶναι τῆς ψυχῆς τὰς φλέβας καὶ τὰς ἀρτηρίας καὶ τὰ νεῦρα: 

The veins, arteries, and sinews are the bonds of the soul. 

ὅταν δ᾽ ἰσχύῃ καὶ καθ᾽ αὑτὴν γενομένη ἠρεμῇ, δεσμὰ γίνεσθαι αὐτῆς τοὺς λόγους καὶ τὰ ἔργα. 

But when it is strong and settled down into itself, reasonings and deeds become its bonds. 

ἐκριφθεῖσαν δ᾽ αὐτὴν ἐπὶ γῆς πλάζεσθαι ἐν τῷ ἀέρι ὁμοίαν τῷ σώματι. 

When cast out upon the earth, it wanders in the air like the body. 

τὸν δ᾽ Ἑρμῆν ταμίαν εἶναι τῶν ψυχῶν καὶ διὰ τοῦτο πομπαῖον λέγεσθαι καὶ πυλαῖον καὶ χθόνιον, 

Hermes is the steward of souls, and for that reason is called Hermes the Escorter, Hermes the Keeper of the Gate, and Hermes of the Underworld, 

ἐπειδήπερ οὗτος εἰσπέμπει ἀπὸ τῶν σωμάτων τὰς ψυχὰς ἀπό τε γῆς καὶ ἐκ θαλάττης: 

since it is he who brings in the souls from their bodies both by land and sea ; 

καὶ ἄγεσθαι τὰς μὲν καθαρὰς ἐπὶ τὸν ὕψιστον, τὰς δ᾽ ἀκαθάρτους μήτ᾽ ἐκείναις πελάζειν μήτ᾽ ἀλλήλαις, δεῖσθαι δ᾽ ἐν ἀρρήκτοις δεσμοῖς ὑπ᾽ Ἐρινύων. 37 

and the pure are taken into the uppermost region, but the impure are not permitted to approach the pure or each other, but are bound by the Furies in bonds unbreakable. 

### 32 
εἶναί τε πάντα τὸν ἀέρα ψυχῶν ἔμπλεων: καὶ ταύτας δαίμονάς τε καὶ ἥρωας ὀνομάζεσθαι: 

The whole air is full of souls which are called genii[22](##b-e##22) or heroes; 

καὶ ὑπὸ τούτων πέμπεσθαι ἀνθρώποις τούς τ᾽ ὀνείρους καὶ τὰ σημεῖα νόσου τε καὶ ὑγιείας, καὶ οὐ μόνον ἀνθρώποις, ἀλλὰ καὶ προ-βάτοις καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις κτήνεσιν: 

these are they who send men dreams and signs of future disease and health, and not to men alone, but to sheep also and cattle as well; 

εἴς τε τούτους γίνεσθαι τούς τε καθαρμοὺς καὶ ἀποτροπιασμοὺς μαντικήν τε πᾶσαν καὶ κληδόνας καὶ τὰ ὅμοια. 

and it is to them that purifications and [lustrations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lustratio), all divination, omens and the like, have reference. 

μέγιστον δέ φησιν εἶναι τῶν ἐν ἀνθρώποις τὸ τὴν ψυχὴν πεῖσαι ἐπὶ τὸ ἀγαθὸν ἢ ἐπὶ τὸ κακόν. 

The most momentous thing in human life is the art of winning the soul to good or to evil. 

εὐδαιμονεῖν τ᾽ ἀνθρώπους ὅταν ἀγαθὴ ψυχὴ προσγένηται, 

Blest are the men who acquire a good soul; 

μηδέποτε δ᾽ ἠρεμεῖν μηδὲ τὸν αὐτὸν : : ῥόον κρατεῖν.38 

\[if it be bad\] they can never be at rest, nor ever keep the same course two days together.

### 33 
Ὅρκιόν τ᾽ εἶναι τὸ δίκαιον καὶ διὰ τοῦτο Δία ὅρκιον λέγεσθαι. 

Right has the force of an oath, and that is why Zeus is called the God of Oaths. 

τήν τ᾽ ἀρετὴν ἁρμονίαν εἶναι καὶ τὴν ὑγίειαν καὶ τὸ ἀγαθὸν ἅπαν καὶ τὸν θεόν: 

Virtue is harmony, and so are health and all good and God himself; 

διὸ καὶ καθ᾽ ἁρμονίαν συνεστάναι τὰ ὅλα. 

this is why they say that all things are constructed according to the laws of harmony. 

φιλίαν τ᾽ εἶναι ἐναρμόνιον ἰσότητα. 

The love of friends is just concord and equality. 

τιμὰς θεοῖς δεῖν νομίζειν καὶ ἥρωσι μὴ τὰς ἴσας, ἀλλὰ θεοῖς ἀεὶ μετ᾽ εὐφημίας λευχειμονοῦντας καὶ ἁγνεύοντας, ἥρωσι δ᾽ ἀπὸ μέσου ἡμέρας. 

We should not pay equal worship to gods and heroes, but to the gods always, with reverent silence, in white robes, and after purification, to the heroes only from midday onwards. 

τὴν δ᾽ ἁγνείαν εἶναι διὰ καθαρμῶν καὶ λουτρῶν καὶ περιρραντηρίων καὶ διὰ τοῦ καθαρεύειν ἀπό τε κήδους καὶ λεχοῦς καὶ μιάσματος παντὸς καὶ ἀπέχεσθαι βρωτῶν θνησειδίων τε κρεῶν καὶ τριγλῶν καὶ μελανούρων καὶ ᾠῶν καὶ τῶν ᾠοτόκων ζῴων καὶ κυάμων καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ὧν παρακελεύονται καὶ οἱ τὰς τελετὰς ἐν τοῖς ἱεροῖς ἐπιτελοῦντες. 39 

Purification is by cleansing, baptism and lustration, and by keeping clean from all deaths and births and all pollution, and abstaining from meat and flesh of animals that have died, mullets, gurnards, eggs and egg-sprung animals, beans, and the other abstinences prescribed by those who perform mystic rites in the temples. 
### 34 
φησὶ δ᾽ Ἀριστοτέλης ἐν τῷ Περὶ τῶν Πυθαγορείων[40](##b-g##40) παραγγέλλειν αὐτὸν ἀπέχεσθαι τῶν κυάμων ἤτοι ὅτι αἰδοίοις εἰσὶν ὅμοιοι ἢ ὅτι ᾍδου πύλαις. : : ἀγόνατον γὰρ μόνον: ἢ ὅτι φθείρει ἢ ὅτι τῇ τοῦ ὅλου φύσει ὅμοιον ἢ ὅτι ὀλιγαρχικόν: κληροῦνται γοῦν αὐτοῖς. 

According to [Aristotle in his work On the Pythagoreans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoreanism#:~:text=In%20On%20the%20Heavens%2C%20Aristotle%20refuted%20the%20Pythagorean%20doctrine%20on%20the%20harmony%20of%20the%20spheres.%5B72%5D%20Nevertheless%2C%20he%20wrote%20a%20treatise%20on%20the%20Pythagoreans%20of%20which%20only%20fragments%20survive), Pythagoras counselled abstinence from beans either because they are like the genitals, or because they are like the gates of Hades . . . as being alone unjointed, or because they are injurious, or because they are like the form of the universe, or because they belong to oligarchy, since they are used in election by lot. 

τὰ δὲ πεσόντα μὴ ἀναιρεῖσθαι, ὑπὲρ τοῦ ἐθίζεσθαι μὴ ἀκολάστως ἐσθίειν ἢ ὅτι ἐπὶ τελευτῇ τινος: 

He bade his disciples not to pick up fallen crumbs, either in order to accustom them not to eat immoderately, or because connected with a person's death; 

καὶ Ἀριστοφάνης δὲ τῶν ἡρώων φησὶν εἶναι τὰ πίπτοντα, λέγων ἐν τοῖς Ἥρωσι,

nay, even, according to Aristo- phanes, crumbs belong to the heroes, for in his Heroes he says23:

μηδὲ γεύεσθ᾽ ἅττ᾽ ἂν ἐντὸς τῆς τραπέζης καταπέσῃ:

Nor taste ye of what falls beneath the board !

Ἀλεκτρυόνος μὴ ἅπτεσθαι λευκοῦ, ὅτι ἱερὸς τοῦ Μηνὸς καὶ ἱκέτης: 

Another of his precepts was not to eat white cocks, as being sacred to the Month and wearing suppliant garb--

τὸ δ᾽ ἦν τῶν ἀγαθῶν: 

now supplication ranked with things good-- 

τῷ τε Μηνὶ ἱερός: σημαίνει γὰρ τὰς ὥρας. 

sacred to the Month because they announce the time of day ; 

καὶ τὸ μὲν λευκὸν τῆς τἀγαθοῦ φύσεως, τὸ δὲ μέλαν τοῦ κακοῦ. 

and again white represents the nature of the good, black the nature of evil. 

τῶν ἰχθύων μὴ ἅπτεσθαι, ὅσοι ἱεροί: μὴ γὰρ δεῖν τὰ αὐτὰ τετάχθαι θεοῖς καὶ ἀνθρώποις, ὥσπερ οὐδ᾽ ἐλευθέροις καὶ δούλοις. 

Not to touch such fish as were sacred; for it is not right that gods and men should be allotted the same things, any more than free men and slaves. 

ἄρτον μὴ καταγνύειν, ὅτι ἐπὶ ἕνα οἱ πάλαι τῶν φίλων ἐφοίτων, 41 

Not to break bread ; for once friends used to meet over one loaf, 

### 35 

καθάπερ ἔτι καὶ νῦν οἱ βάρβαροι: 

as the barbarians do even to this day ; 

μηδὲ διαιρεῖν, ὃς συνάγει αὐτούς: 

and you should not divide bread which brings them together; 

οἱ δέ, πρὸς τὴν ἐν ᾄδου κρίσιν: οἱ δ᾽ εἰς πόλεμον δειλίαν ποιεῖν: 

οἱ δέ, ἐπεὶ ἀπὸ τούτου[42](b-g##42) ἄρχεται τὸ ὅλον.

some give as the explanation of this that it has reference to the judgement of the dead in Hades, others that bread makes cowards in war, others again that it is from it that the whole world begins.[24](##b-e##24)

Καὶ τῶν σχημάτων τὸ κάλλιστον σφαῖραν εἶναι τῶν στερεῶν, τῶν δ᾽ ἐπιπέδων κύκλον.  

He held that the most beautiful figure is the sphere among solids, and the circle among plane figures. 

γῆρας καὶ πᾶν τὸ μειούμενον ὅμοιον: καὶ αὔξην καὶ νεότητα ταὐτόν.

Old age may be compared to everything that is decreasing, while youth is one with increase. 

ὑγίειαν τὴν τοῦ εἴδους διαμονήν, νόσον τὴν τούτου φθοράν. 

Health means retention of the form, disease its destruction. 

περὶ τῶν ἁλῶν, ὅτι δεῖ παρατίθεσθαι πρὸς ὑπόμνησιν τοῦ δικαίου: οἱ γὰρ ἅλες πᾶν σῴζουσιν ὅ τι ἂν παραλάβωσι καὶ γεγόνασιν ἐκ τῶν καθαρωτάτων ἡλίου καὶ θαλάσσης.43 

Of salt he said it should be brought to table to remind us of what is right; for salt preserves whatever it finds, and it arises from the purest sources, sun and sea.

### 36 
Καὶ ταῦτα μέν φησιν ὁ Ἀλέξανδρος ἐν τοῖς Πυθαγορικοῖς ὑπομνήμασιν εὑρηκέναι, 

This is what Alexander says that he found in the Pythagorean memoirs.[25](##b-e##25) 

καὶ τὰ ἐκείνων ἐχόμενα ὁ Ἀριστοτέλης.

What follows is Aristotle's.

Τὴν δὲ σεμνοπρέπειαν τοῦ Πυθαγόρου καὶ Τίμων ἐν τοῖς Σίλλοις δάκνων αὐτὸν ὅμως οὐ παρέλιπεν, εἰπὼν οὕτω:

But Pythagoras's great dignity not even Timon overlooked, who, although he digs at him in his Silli,26 speaks of 

Πυθαγόρην τε γόητας ἀποκλίναντ᾽ ἐπὶ δόξας θήρῃ ἐπ᾽ ἀνθρώπων, σεμνηγορίης ὀαριστήν.

Pythagoras, inclined to witching works and ways,
Man-snarer, fond of noble periphrase.

περὶ δὲ τοῦ ἄλλοτ᾽ ἄλλον αὐτὸν γεγενῆσθαι Ξενοφάνης ἐν ἐλεγείᾳ προσμαρτυρεῖ, ἧς ἀρχή,

[Xenophanes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophanes#Life)[27](##b-e##27) confirms the statement about his having been different people at different times in the [elegiacs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophanes#Social_criticism) beginning :

νῦν αὖτ᾽ ἄλλον ἔπειμι λόγον, δείξω δὲ κέλευθον.

Now other thoughts, another path, I show.

ὃ δὲ περὶ αὐτοῦ φησιν, οὕτως ἔχει:

What he says of him is as follows :

καί ποτέ μιν στυφελιζομένου σκύλακος παριόντα φασὶν ἐποικτῖραι καὶ τόδε φάσθαι ἔπος: 

They say that, passing a belaboured whelp,
He, full of pity, spake these words of dole :

"παῦσαι μηδὲ ῥάπιζ᾽, ἐπεὶ ἦ φίλου ἀνέρος ἐστὶ ψυχή, τὴν ἔγνων φθεγξαμένης ἀΐων."44 

"Stay, smite not ! 'Tis a friend, a human soul ;
I knew him straight whenas I heard him yelp !"

### 37 
Καὶ ταῦτα μὲν ὁ Ξενοφάνης. 

Thus Xenophanes. 

ἔσκωψε δ᾽ αὐτὸν Κρατῖνος μὲν ἐν Πυθαγοριζούσῃ: ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐν Ταραντίνοις φησὶν οὕτως:

But [Cratinus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cratinus_Junior#Surviving_titles_and_fragments) also lampooned him both in the Pythagorizing Woman and also in The Tarentines, where we read[28](##b-e##28):

ἔθος ἐστὶν αὐτοῖς, ἄν τιν᾽ ἰδιώτην ποθὲν λάβωσιν εἰσελθόντα, διαπειρώμενον τῆς τῶν λόγων ῥώμης ταράττειν καὶ κυκᾶν τοῖς ἀντιθέτοις, τοῖς πέρασι, τοῖς παρισώμασιν, τοῖς ἀποπλάνοις, τοῖς μεγέθεσιν νουβυστικῶς.

They are wont,
If haply they a foreigner do find,
To hold a cross-examination
Of doctrines' worth, to trouble and confound him
With terms, equations, and antitheses
Brain-bung'd with magnitudes and periphrases.

Μνησίμαχος δ᾽ Ἀλκμαίωνι:

Again, [Mnesimachus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_comedy#:~:text=Mnesimachus) in the [Alcmaeon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcmaeon_of_Croton#Pythagorean)[29](##b-e##29):

ὡς Πυθαγοριστὶ θύομεν τῷ Λοξίᾳ, ἔμψυχον οὐδὲν ἐσθίοντες παντελῶς.45 

To Loxias we sacrifice : Pythagoras his rite,
Of nothing that is animate we ever take a bite.
### 38
Ἀριστοφῶν Πυθαγοριστῇ:

And [Aristophon in the Pythagorist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristophon_(comic_poet)#:~:text=Pythagorean)[30](##b-e##30):

ἔφη καταβὰς ἐς τὴν δίαιταν τῶν κάτω ἰδεῖν ἑκάστους, διαφέρειν δὲ πάμπολυ τοὺς Πυθαγοριστὰς τῶν νεκρῶν: μόνοισι γὰρ
τούτοισι τὸν Πλούτωνα συσσιτεῖν ἔφη δι᾽ εὐσέβειαν. 

a. He told how he travelled in Hades and looked on the dwellers below,
How each of them lives, but how different by far from the lives of the dead
Were the lives of the Pythagoreans, for these alone, so he said, Were suffered to dine with King Pluto, which was for their piety's sake.

β. δυσχερῆ θεὸν λέγεις, εἰ τοῖς ῥύπου μεστοῖσιν ἥδεται ξυνών.

b. What an ill-tempered god for whom such swine, such creatures good company make ;

ἔτι ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ:

and in the same later :

ἐσθίουσί τε λάχανά τε καὶ πίνουσιν ἐπὶ τούτοις ὕδωρ: φθεῖρας δὲ καὶ τρίβωνα τήν τ᾽ ἀλουσίαν οὐδεὶς ἂν ὑπομείνειε τῶν ἑτέρων <νεκρῶν>.46 

Their food is just greens, and to wet it pure water is all that they drink ;
And the want of a bath, and the vermin, and their old threadbare coats so do stink
That none of the rest will come near them.
### 39
Ἐτελεύτα δ᾽ ὁ Πυθαγόρας τοῦτον τὸν τρόπον. 

Pythagoras met his death in this wise.[31](##b-e##31) 

συνεδρεύοντος μετὰ τῶν συνήθων ἐν τῇ Μίλωνος οἰκίᾳ \[τούτου\], ὑπό τινος τῶν μὴ παραδοχῆς ἀξιωθέντων διὰ φθόνον ὑποπρησθῆναι τὴν οἰκίαν συνέβη: 

As he sat one day among his acquaintances at the house of [Milo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milo_of_Croton#:~:text=Pythagoras), it chanced that the house was set ablaze out of jealousy by one of the people who were not accounted worthy of admittance to his presence, 

τινὲς δ᾽ αὐτοὺς τοὺς Κροτωνιάτας τοῦτο πρᾶξαι, τυραννίδος ἐπίθεσιν εὐλαβουμένους. 

though some say it was the work of the inhabitants of Croton anxious to safeguard themselves against the setting-up of a tyranny. 

τὸν δὴ Πυθαγόραν καταληφθῆναι διεξιόντα: 

Pythagoras was caught as he tried to escape; 

καὶ πρός τινι χωρίῳ γενόμενος πλήρει κυάμων, ἵνα \[αὐτόθι\] ἔστη, εἰπὼν ἁλῶναι ἂν μᾶλλον ἢ πατῆσαι ἀναιρεθῆναι δὲ κρεῖττον ἢ λαλῆσαι: 

he got as far as a certain field of beans, where he stopped, saying he would be captured rather than cross it, and be killed rather than prate about his doctrines; 

καὶ ὧδε πρὸς τῶν διωκόντων ἀποσφαγῆναι. 

and so his pursuers cut his throat.[32](##b-e##32) 

οὕτω δὲ καὶ τοὺς πλείους τῶν ἑταίρων αὐτοῦ διαφθαρῆναι, ὄντας πρὸς τοὺς τετταράκοντα: 

So also were murdered more than half of his disciples, to the number of forty or thereabouts; 

διαφυγεῖν δ᾽ ὀλίγους, ὧν ἦν καὶ Ἄρχιππος ὁ Ταραντῖνος καὶ Λῦσις ὁ προειρημένος.47 

but a very few escaped, including Archippus of Tarentum and Lysis[f10](#f#10), already mentioned.
### 40
Φησὶ δὲ Δικαίαρχος τὸν Πυθαγόραν ἀποθανεῖν καταφυγόντα εἰς τὸ ἐν Μεταποντίῳ ἱερὸν τῶν Μουσῶν, τετταράκοντ᾽ ἡμέρας ἀσιτήσαντα. 

[Dicaearchus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dicaearchus#:~:text=Pythagoras), however, says that Pythagoras died a fugitive in the temple of the Muses at Metapontum after forty days' starvation. 

Ἡρακλείδης δέ φησιν ἐν τῇ τῶν Σατύρου βίων ἐπιτομῇ μετὰ τὸ θάψαι Φερεκύδην ἐν Δήλῳ ἐπανελθεῖν εἰς Ἰταλίαν καὶ : : πανδαισίαν εὑρόντα Κύλωνος τοῦ Κροτωνιάτου εἰς Μεταπόντιον ὑπεξελθεῖν κἀκεῖ τὸν βίον καταστρέψαι ἀσιτίᾳ, μὴ βουλόμενον περαιτέρω ζῆν. 

Heraclides[f11](##fn#11), in his [Epitome of the Lives of Satyrus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclides_Lembus#:~:text=Satyrus), says that, after burying Pherecydes at Delos, he returned to Italy and, when he found Cylon of Croton[f12](##fn#12) giving a luxurious banquet to all and sundry, retired to Metapontum to end his days there by starvation, having no wish to live longer. 

Ἕρμιππος δέ φησι, πολεμούντων Ἀκραγαντίνων καὶ Συρακοσίων, ἐξελθεῖν τὸν Πυθαγόραν μετὰ τῶν συνήθων καὶ προστῆναι τῶν Ἀκραγαντίνων: τροπῆς δὲ γενομένης περικάμπτοντα αὐτὸν τὴν τῶν κυάμων χώραν ὑπὸ τῶν Συρακοσίων ἀναιρεθῆναι: 

On the other hand, Hermippus[f1](##fn#1) relates that, when the men of [Agrigentum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrigento) and Syracuse were at war, Pythagoras and his disciples went out and fought in the van of the army of the Agrigentines, and, their line being turned, he was killed by the Syracusans as he was trying to avoid the beanfield; 

τούς τε λοιπούς, ὄντας πρὸς τοὺς πέντε καὶ τριάκοντα, ἐν Τάραντι κατακαυθῆναι, θέλοντας ἀντιπολιτεύεσθαι τοῖς προεστῶσι.48 

the rest, about thirty-five in number, were burned at the stake in Tarentum for trying to set up a government in opposition to those in power.

### 41 
Καὶ ἄλλο τι περὶ Πυθαγόρου φησὶν ὁ Ἕρμιππος. \[λέγει γὰρ\] 

Hermippus[f1](##fn#1) gives another anecdote. 

ὡς γενόμενος ἐν Ἰταλίᾳ κατὰ γῆς οἰκίσκον ποιήσαι καὶ τῇ μητρὶ ἐντείλαιτο τὰ γινόμενα εἰς δέλτον γράφειν σημειουμένην καὶ τὸν χρόνον, ἔπειτα καθιέναι αὐτῷ ἔστ᾽ ἂν ἀνέλθῃ. τοῦτο ποιῆσαι τὴν μητέρα. 

Pythagoras, on coming to Italy, made a subterranean dwelling and enjoined on his mother to mark and record all that passed, and at what hour, and to send her notes down to him until he should ascend. She did so. 

τὸν δὲ Πυθαγόραν μετὰ χρόνον ἀνελθεῖν ἰσχνὸν καὶ κατεσκελετευμένον: εἰσελθόντα τ᾽ εἰς τὴν ἐκκλησίαν φάσκειν ὡς ἀφῖκται ἐξ ᾄδου: καὶ δὴ καὶ ἀνεγίνωσκεν αὐτοῖς τὰ συμβεβηκότα. 

Pythagoras some time afterwards came up withered and looking like a skeleton, then went into the assembly and declared he had been down to Hades, and even read out his experiences to them. 

οἱ δὲ σαινόμενοι τοῖς λεγομένοις ἐδάκρυόν τε καὶ ᾤμωζον καὶ ἐπίστευον εἶναι τὸν Πυθαγόραν θεῖόν τινα, ὥστε καὶ τὰς γυναῖκας αὐτῷ παραδοῦναι, ὡς καὶ μαθησομένας τι τῶν αὐτοῦ: 

They were so affected that they wept and wailed and looked upon him as divine, going so far as to send their wives to him in hopes that they would learn some of his doctrines; 

ἃς καὶ Πυθαγορικὰς κληθῆναι. 

and so they were called Pythagorean women. 

καὶ ταῦτα μὲν ὁ Ἕρμιππος.49 

Thus far Hermippus.
### 42
Ἦν δὲ τῷ Πυθαγόρᾳ καὶ γυνή, Θεανὼ ὄνομα, Βροντίνου τοῦ Κροτωνιάτου θυγάτηρ: οἱ δέ, γυναῖκα μὲν εἶναι Βροντίνου, μαθήτριαν δὲ Πυθαγόρου. 

Pythagoras had a wife, [Theano](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theano_(philosopher)) by name, daughter of [Brontinus of Croton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brontinus), though some call her Brontinus's wife and Pythagoras's pupil. 

ἦν αὐτῷ καὶ θυγάτηρ Δαμώ, ὥς φησι Λῦσις ἐν ἐπιστολῇ τῇ πρὸς Ἵππασον, περὶ Πυθαγόρου λέγων οὕτως: 

He had a daughter [Damo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damo_(philosopher)), according to the letter of Lysis[f10](##fn#10) to Hippasus[f13](##fn#13), which says of him, 

"λέγοντι δὲ πολλοὶ τὺ καὶ δαμοσίᾳ φιλοσοφέν, ὅπερ ἀπαξίωσε Πυθαγόρας, ὅς γέ τοι Δαμοῖ τᾷ ἑαυτοῦ θυγατρὶ παρακαταθέμενος τὰ ὑπομνάματα ἐπέσκαψε μηδενὶ τῶν ἐκτὸς τᾶς οἰκίας παραδιδόμεν. 

"I am told by many that you discourse publicly, a thing which Pythagoras deemed unworthy, for certain it is that, when he entrusted his daughter Damo with the custody of his memoirs, he solemnly charged her never to give them to anyone outside his house. 

ἁ δὲ δυναμένα πολλῶν χραμάτων ἀποδίδοσθαι τὼς λόγως οὐκ ἐβουλάθη: 

And, although she could have sold the writings for a large sum of money, she would not, 

πενίαν δὲ καὶ τὰς τῶ πατρὸς ἐπισκάψιας ἐνόμιζε χρυσῶ τιμιωτέρας ἦμεν, καὶ ταῦτα γυνά."50 

but reckoned poverty and her father's solemn injunctions more precious than gold, for all that she was a woman."
### 43 
Ἦν καὶ Τηλαύγης υἱὸς αὐτοῖς, ὃς καὶ διεδέξατο τὸν πατέρα καὶ κατά τινας Ἐμπεδοκλέους καθηγήσατο: 


They also had a son [Telauges](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telauges), who succeeded his father and, according to some, was [Empedocles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empedocles)' instructor. 

Ἱππόβοτός γέ τοί φησι λέγειν Ἐμπεδοκλέα,


At all events [Hippobotus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippobotus) makes Empedocles say[33](##b-e##33):

Τήλαυγες, κλυτὲ κοῦρε Θεανοῦς Πυθαγόρεώ τε.

Telauges, famed
Son of Theano and Pythagoras.

σύγγραμμα δὲ \[φέρεται\] τοῦ Τηλαύγους οὐδέν, τῆς δὲ μητρὸς αὐτοῦ Θεανοῦς τινα. 

Telauges wrote nothing, so far as we know, but his mother Theano wrote a few things. 

ἀλλὰ καί φασιν αὐτὴν ἐρωτηθεῖσαν ποσταία γυνὴ ἀπ᾽ ἀνδρὸς καθαρεύει, 

Further, a story is told that being asked how many days it was before a woman becomes pure after intercourse, 

φάναι, "ἀπὸ μὲν τοῦ ἰδίου παραχρῆμα, ἀπὸ δὲ τοῦ ἀλλοτρίου οὐδέποτε." 

she replied, "With her own husband at once, with another man never." 

τῇ δὲ πρὸς τὸν ἴδιον ἄνδρα μελλούσῃ πορεύεσθαι παρῄνει ἅμα τοῖς ἐνδύμασι καὶ τὴν αἰσχύνην ἀποτίθεσθαι, ἀνισταμένην τε πάλιν ἅμ᾽ αὐτοῖσιν ἀναλαμβάνειν. 

And she advised a woman going in to her own husband to put off her shame with her clothes, and on leaving him to put it on again along with them. 

ἐρωτηθεῖσα, "ποῖα;" ἔφη, "ταῦτα δι᾽ ἃ γυνὴ κέκλημαι."51 

Asked "Put on what?" she replied, "What makes me to be called a woman."
### 44 

Ὁ δ᾽ οὖν Πυθαγόρας, 

To return to Pythagoras. 

ὡς μὲν Ἡρακλείδης φησὶν ὁ τοῦ Σαραπίωνος, ὀγδοηκοντούτης ἐτελεύτα, 

According to Heraclides, the son of Serapion[f11](##fn#11), he was eighty years old when he died, 

κατὰ τὴν ἰδίαν ὑπογραφὴν τῶν ἡλικιῶν: ὡς δ᾽ οἱ πλείους, ἔτη βιοὺς ἐνενήκοντα. 

and this agrees with his own description of the life of man, though most authorities say he was ninety. 

καὶ ἡμῶν ἐστιν εἰς αὐτὸν πεπαιγμένα οὕτως ἔχοντα:

And there are jesting lines of my own upon him as follows[34](##b-e##34):

οὐ μόνος ἐμψύχων ἄπεχες χέρας, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἡμεῖς: τίς γὰρ ὃς ἐμψύχων ἥψατο, Πυθαγόρα;

Not thou alone from all things animate Didst keep, Pythagoras. 

ἀλλ᾽ ὅταν ἑψηθῇ τι καὶ ὀπτηθῇ καὶ ἁλισθῇ, δὴ τότε καὶ ψυχὴν οὐκ ἔχον ἐσθίομεν.

All food is dead When boil'd and bak'd and salt-besprinkle-èd;
For then it surely is inanimate.

ἄλλο:

Again[35](##b-e##35):

ἦν ἄρα Πυθαγόρης τοῖος σοφός, ὥστε μὲν αὐτὸς μὴ ψαύειν κρειῶν καὶ λέγεν ὡς ἄδικον,
σιτίζειν δ᾽ ἄλλους. ἄγαμαι σοφόν: αὐτὸς ἔφα μὲν οὐκ ἀδικεῖν, ἄλλους δ᾽ αὐτὸς ἔτευχ᾽ ἀδικεῖν.52 

So wise was wise Pythagoras that he Would touch no meats, but called it impious, Bade others eat. Good wisdom : not for us
To do the wrong; let others impious be.
### 45 
καὶ ἄλλο:

And again[36](##b-e##36): 

τὰς φρένας ἢν ἐθέλῃς τὰς Πυθαγόραο νοῆσαι, ἀσπίδος Εὐφόρβου βλέψον ἐς ὀμφάλιον.
φησὶ γὰρ οὗτος, Ἐγὼν ἦν πρόβροτος: ὃς δ᾽ ὅτε οὐκ ἦν,
φάσκων ὥς τις ἔην, οὔτις ἔην ὅτ᾽ ἔην.

If thou wouldst know the mind of old Pythagoras, Look on Euphorbus' buckler and its boss.
He says "I've lived before." If, when he says he was, He was not, he was no-one when he was.

καὶ ἄλλο, ὡς ἐτελεύτα:

And again, of the manner of his death[37](##b-e##37):

αἲ, αἴ, Πυθαγόρης τί τόσον κυάμους ἐσεβάσθη; καὶ θάνε φοιτηταῖς ἄμμιγα τοῖς ἰδίοις.
χωρίον ἦν κυάμων: ἵνα μὴ τούτους δὲ πατήσῃ, ἐξ Ἀκραγαντίνων κάτθαν᾽ ἐνὶ τριόδῳ.

Woe! Woe! Whence, Pythagoras, this deep reverence for beans? Why did he fall in the midst of his disciples? A bean-field there was he durst not cross; sooner than trample on it, he endured to be slain at the cross-roads by the men of [Acragas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrigento).

Ἤκμαζε δὲ καὶ κατὰ τὴν ἑξηκοστὴν Ὀλυμπιάδα,

He flourished in the 60th Olympiad[38](##b-e##38) 

καὶ αὐτοῦ τὸ σύστημα διέμενε μέχρι γενεῶν ἐννέα ἢ καὶ δέκα: 53 

and his school lasted until the ninth or tenth generation. 
### 46 
τελευταῖοι γὰρ ἐγένοντο τῶν Πυθαγορείων, οὓς καὶ Ἀριστόξενος εἶδε, Ξενόφιλός τε ὁ Χαλκιδεὺς ἀπὸ Θρᾴκης καὶ Φάντων ὁ Φλιάσιος καὶ Ἐχεκράτης καὶ Διοκλῆς καὶ Πολύμναστος, Φλιάσιοι καὶ αὐτοί. ἦσαν δ᾽ ἀκροαταὶ Φιλολάου καὶ Εὐρύτου τῶν Ταραντίνων.

For the last of the Pythagoreans, whom Aristoxenus[f2](##fn#2) in his time saw, were Xenophilus[f8](##fn#8) from the Thracian Chalcidice, [Phanton of Phlius](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phanto_of_Phlius), and [Echecrates](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echecrates_of_Phlius), Diocles and Polymnastus, also of Phlius, who were pupils of Philolaus[f6](##fn#6) and [Eurytus of Tarentum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurytus_(Pythagorean)).

Γεγόνασι δὲ Πυθαγόραι τέτταρες περὶ τοὺς αὐτοὺς χρόνους, οὐ πολὺ ἀπ᾽ ἀλλήλων ἀπέχοντες: 

There were four men of the name of Pythagoras living about the same time and at no great distance from one another : 

εἷς μὲν Κροτωνιάτης, τυραννικὸς ἄνθρωπος: ἕτερος Φλιάσιος, σωμασκητής, \[ ἀλείπτης, ὥς φασί τινες: τρίτος Ζακύνθιος: τέταρτος αὐτὸς οὗτος, οὗ φασιν εἶναι τἀπόρρητα τῆς φιλοσοφίας: \[ αὐτῶν διδάσκαλος: ἐφ᾽ οὗ καὶ τὸ Αὐτὸς ἔφα παροιμιακὸν εἰς τὸν βίον ἦλθεν.54 

(1) of Croton, a man with tyrannical leanings ; (2) of Phlius, an athlete, some say a trainer ; (3) of Zacynthus ; (4) our subject, who discovered the secrets of philosophy \[and taught them\], and to whom was applied the phrase, "The Master said" (Ipse dixit), which passed into a proverb of ordinary life. 
### 47 
οἱ δὲ καὶ ἄλλον ἀνδριαντοποιὸν Ῥηγῖνον γεγονέναι φασὶ Πυθαγόραν, πρῶτον δοκοῦντα ῥυθμοῦ καὶ συμμετρίας ἐστοχάσθαι: καὶ ἄλλον ἀνδριαντοποιὸν Σάμιον: 

Some say there was also [another Pythagoras, a sculptor of Rhegium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras_(sculptor)), who is thought to have been the first to aim at rhythm and symmetry ; another a sculptor of Samos ; 

another a bad orator ; 

καὶ ἕτερον ῥήτορα μοχθηρόν: 

καὶ ἰατρὸν ἄλλον, τὰ περὶ κήλης γεγραφότα καί τινα περὶ Ὁμήρου συντεταγμένον: 

another a doctor who wrote on hernia and also compiled some things about Homer ; 

καὶ ἕτερον Δωρικὰ πεπραγματευμένον, ὡς Διονύσιος ἱστορεῖ. 

and yet another who, so we are told by [Dionysius](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus), wrote a history of the Dorian race. 

Ἐρατοσθένης δέ φησι, καθὸ καὶ Φαβωρῖνος ἐν τῇ ὀγδόῃ Παντοδαπῆς ἱστορίας παρατίθεται, τοῦτον εἶναι τὸν πρῶτον ἐντέχνως πυκτεύσαντα ἐπὶ τῆς ὀγδόης καὶ τετταρακοστῆς Ὀλυμπιάδος, κομήτην καὶ ἁλουργίδα φοροῦντα: 

[Eratosthenes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes) says, according to what we learn from Favorinus[f15](##fn#15) in the eighth book of his Miscellaneous History, that the [last-named was the first to box scientifically](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras_(boxer)), in the 48th Olympiad,[39](##b-e##39) keeping his hair long and wearing a purple robe ; 

ἐκκριθέντα τ᾽ ἐκ τῶν παίδων καὶ χλευασθέντα αὐτίκα προσβῆναι τοὺς ἄνδρας καὶ νικῆσαι.55 

and that when he was excluded with ridicule from the boys' contest, he went at once to the men's and won that ; 
### 48 
δηλοῦν δὲ τοῦτο καὶ τοὐπίγραμμα ὅπερ ἐποίησε Θεαίτητος:

this is declared by [Theaetetus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theaetetus_(poet))'s epigram[40](##b-e##40):

Πυθαγόρην τινά, Πυθαγόρην, ὦ ξεῖνε, κομήτην, ᾀδόμενον πύκτην εἰ κατέχεις Σάμιον,
Πυθαγόρης ἐγώ εἰμι: τὰ δ᾽ ἔργα μου εἴ τιν᾽ ἔροιο Ἠλείων, φήσεις αὐτὸν ἄπιστα λέγειν.

Know'st one Pythagoras, long-haired Pythagoras,
The far-fam'd boxer of the Samians?
I am Pythagoras ; ask the Elians
What were my feats, thou'lt not believe the tale.

Τοῦτον ὁ Φαβωρῖνός φησιν ὅροις χρήσασθαι διὰ τῆς μαθηματικῆς ὕλης, ἐπὶ πλέον δὲ Σωκράτην καὶ τοὺς ἐκείνῳ πλησιάσαντας, καὶ μετὰ ταῦτ᾽ Ἀριστοτέλην καὶ τοὺς στωικούς.

Favorinus[f15](##fn#15) says that our philosopher used definitions throughout the subject matter of mathematics ; their use was extended by Socrates and his disciples, and afterwards by Aristotle and the Stoics.

Ἀλλὰ μὴν καὶ τὸν οὐρανὸν πρῶτον ὀνομάσαι κόσμον καὶ τὴν γῆν στρογγύλην: ὡς δὲ Θεόφραστος, Παρμενίδην: ὡς δὲ Ζήνων, Ἡσίοδον.56 

Further, we are told that he was the first to call the heaven the universe and the earth spherical,[41](##b-e##41) though [Theophrastus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophrastus) says it was Parmenides, and Zeno that it was Hesiod. 

### 49 
τούτῳ φασὶν ἀντιπαρατάσσεσθαι Κύλωνα καθάπερ Ἀντίλοχον Σωκράτει.

It is said that Cylon[f12](##fn#12) was a rival of Pythagoras, as Antilochus[42](##b-e##42) was of Socrates.

Ἐπὶ δὲ τοῦ ἀθλητοῦ Πυθαγόρου καὶ τοῦτ᾽ ἐλέγετο τὸ ἐπίγραμμα:

Pythagoras the athlete was also the subject of another epigram as follows[43](##b-e##43):

οὗτος πυκτεύσων ἐς Ὀλύμπια παισὶν ἄνηβος ἤλυθε Πυθαγόρης ὁ Κράτεω Σάμιος.

Gone to box with other lads
Is the lad Pythagoras,
Gone to the games Olympian
Crates' son the Samian.

ὁ δὲ φιλόσοφος καὶ ὧδε ἐπέστειλε:

The philosopher also wrote the following letter :

Πυθαγόρης Ἀναξιμένει.
"Καὶ σύ, ὦ λῷστε, εἰ μηδὲν ἀμείνων ἦς Πυθαγόρεω γενεήν τε καὶ κλέος, μεταναστὰς ἂν οἴχεο ἐκ Μιλήτου: νῦν δὲ κατερύκει σε ἡ πατρόθεν εὔκλεια, καὶ ἐμὲ δὲ ἂν κατείρυκεν Ἀναξιμένει ἐοικότα. εἰ δὲ ὑμεῖς οἱ ὀνήιστοι τὰς πόλιας ἐκλείψετε, ἀπὸ μὲν αὐτέων ὁ κόσμος αἱρεθήσεται, ἐπικινδυνότερα δ᾽ αὐτῇσι τὰ ἐκ Μήδων.57 

Pythagoras to Anaximenes.
"Even you, O most excellent of men, were you no better born and famed than Pythagoras, would have risen and departed from Miletus. But now your ancestral glory has detained you as it had detained me were I Anaximenes's peer. But if you, the best men, abandon your cities, then will their good order perish, and the peril from the Medes will increase. 
### 50 
οὔτε δὲ αἰεὶ καλὸν αἰθερολογέειν μελεδωνόν τε εἶναι τῇ πατρίδι κάλλιον.

For always to scan the heavens is not well, but more seemly is it to be provident for one's mother country. 

καὶ ἐγὼ δὲ οὐ πάντα περὶ τοὺς ἐμεωυτοῦ μύθους, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐν πολέμοις οὓς διαφέρουσιν ἐς ἀλλήλους Ἰταλιῶται."

For I too am not altogether in my discourses but am found no less in the wars which the Italians wage with one another."

Ἐπειδὴ δὲ περὶ Πυθαγόρου διεληλύθαμεν, ῥητέον περὶ τῶν ἐλλογίμων Πυθαγορικῶν: 

Having now finished our account of Pythagoras, we have next to speak of the noteworthy Pythagoreans ; 

μεθ᾽ οὓς περὶ τῶν σποράδην κατά τινας φερομένων: 

after them will come the philosophers whom some denominate "sporadic" [i.e. belonging to no particular school;] 

ἔπειθ᾽ οὕτως ἐξάψομεν τὴν διαδοχὴν τῶν ἀξίων λόγου ἕως Ἐπικούρου καθὰ καὶ προειρήκαμεν. 

and then, in the next place, we will append the succession of all those worthy of notice as far as Epicurus, in the way that we promised. 

περὶ μὲν οὖν Θεανοῦς καὶ Τηλαύγους διειλέγμεθα: 

We have already treated of Theano and Telauges : 

λεκτέον δὲ νῦν περὶ Ἐμπεδοκλέους πρῶτον: 

so now we have first to speak of Empedocles, 

κατὰ γάρ τινας Πυθαγόρου διήκουσεν.

for some say he was a pupil of Pythagoras.

For the doctrines of Pythagoras(§§ 25-35) Alexander is taken as D. L.'s authority (see Introd. pp. xxvi, xxvii) This indefatigable pedant is known to have written a special work on the Pythagorean system. Our author may not have possessed this work by Alexander, but he probably had access to a public library containing it. In any case he deserves praise for the selection. Between Alexander Polyhistor in the first century b.c. and the threshold of the third century a.d. there had been an enormous increase in neoPythagorean literature, mostly dealing with mystical properties of numbers and with ethics based upon theology. All this D. L. ignores, going back to a Hellenistic document long forgotten.

In the account which follows two passages should be distinguished: (1) συνεδρ εύοντο ς συνέβη, and (2) οὔτω δὲ καὶ（§ 40) ἀσιτής αντα. A similar combination of Neanthes and Dicaearchus is found in Porphyry, Vit. Pyth 55 sqq., Neanthes apparently insisting on the absence, and Dicaearchus on the presence, of the master at the time when the brotherhood were attacked and scattered. Iamblichus, Vit. Pyth. 251 sq., cites Nicomachus, whose version agrees with that of Neanthes.

### 32 
[39](#8#1#39)
This passage, partly in direct ( γενόμε νος, ἔστη, εἰπών) and partly in reported speech ( καταλη φθῆναι. ἀποσφαγ ῆναι), receives some light from the story of Myllias and his wife Timycha as given by Iamblichus, Vit. Pyth. 189-194, on the authority of Hippobotus and Neanthes (cf. also Porphyry, Vit. Pyth. § 61, where the story of Damon and Phintias is said to have been transferred by Hippobotus and Neanthes to the same trusty pair, Myllias and Timycha). The story in Iamblichus represents a band of Pythagoreans pursued by a tyrant's myrmidons and caught in a plain where beans were growing, all of them preferring to die where they stood rather than trample on the beans; but this story might be located anywhere. It has nothing inherently to do with the end of Pythagoras. What remains, τὸν δὲ Π. κατα- ληφθῆν αι διεξιό ντα, may be compared with Porphyry, Vit. Pyth. § 57, where we are told that the disciples made a bridge of their own bodies over the fire and thus the master escaped from the burning house but, in despair at the extinction of his school, chose a voluntary dealth. The words οὕτω δέ which follow come in awkwardly, as they are separated from the sentence about the fire.

As Favorinus seems to have paid special attention to discoveries and the invention of names (cf. ii. 1, 20, viii. 12, 47, ix. 23, 34), it seems likely that he is our author's authority here ; so probably a different book of Favorinus is cited.

ὦ φίλοι, οἳ μέγα ἄστυ κατὰ ξανθοῦ Ἀκράγαντος ναίετ᾽ ἀν᾽ ἄκρα πόλεος, ἀγαθῶν μελεδήμονες ἔργων, χαίρετ᾽: 

My friends, who dwell in the grcat city sloping down to yellow Acragas, hard by the citadel, busied with goodly works, all hail! 

ἐγὼ δ᾽ ὑμῖν θεὸς ἄμβροτος, οὐκέτι θνητὸς πωλεῦμαι μετὰ πᾶσι τετιμένος, ὥσπερ ἔοικα, ταινίαις τε περίστεπτος στέφεσίν τε θαλείοις: 

I go about among you an immortal god, no more a mortal, so honoured of all, as is meet, crowned with fillets and flowery garlands. 

τοῖσιν ἅμ᾽ <εὖτ᾽> ἂν ἵκωμαι ἐς ἄστεα τηλεθάοντα, ἀνδράσιν ἠδὲ γυναιξί, σεβίζομαι: 

Straightway as soon as I enter with these, men and women, into flourishing towns, I am reverenced 

οἱ δ᾽ ἅμ᾽ ἕπονται μυρίοι, ἐξερέοντες ὅπῃ πρὸς κέρδος ἀταρπός: 

and tens of thousands follow, to learn where is the path which leads to welfare, 

οἱ μὲν μαντοσυνέων κεχρημένοι, οἱ δ᾽ ἐπὶ νούσων παντοίων ἐπύθοντο κλύειν εὐηκέα βάξιν.

Ἕρμιππος δέ φησι Πάνθειάν τινα Ἀκραγαντίνην ἀπηλπισμένην ὑπὸ τῶν ἰατρῶν θεραπεῦσαι αὐτὸν καὶ διὰ τοῦτο τὴν θυσίαν ἐπιτελεῖν: τοὺς δὲ κληθέντας εἶναι πρὸς τοὺς ὀγδοήκοντα. 

Hermippus tells us that Empedocles cured Panthea, a woman of Agrigentum, who had been given up by the physicians, and this was why he was offering sacrifice, and that those invited were about eighty in number. 

Ἱππόβοτος δέ φησιν ἐξαναστάντα αὐτὸν ὡδευκέναι ὡς ἐπὶ τὴν Αἴτνην, εἶτα παραγενόμενον ἐπὶ τοὺς κρατῆρας τοῦ πυρὸς ἐναλέσθαι καὶ ἀφανισθῆναι, βουλόμενον τὴν περὶ αὑτοῦ φήμην βεβαιῶσαι ὅτι γεγόνοι θεός, ὕστερον δὲ γνωσθῆναι, ἀναρριπισθείσης αὐτοῦ μιᾶς τῶν κρηπίδων: 

Hippobotus, again, asserts that, when he got up, he set out on his way to Etna ; then, when he had reached it, he plunged into the fiery craters and disappeared, his intention being to confirm the report that he had become a god. Afterwards the truth was known, because one of his slippers was thrown up in the flames ; 

χαλκᾶς γὰρ εἴθιστο ὑποδεῖσθαι. 

it had been his custom to wear slippers of bronze.

To this story Pausanias is made (by Heraclides) to take exception.21

Alcmaeon of Croton, another disciple of Pythagoras, wrote chiefly on medicine, but now and again he touches on natural philosophy, as when he says, "Most human affairs go in pairs." He is thought to have been the first to compile a physical treatise, so we learn from Favorinus in his Miscellaneous History ; and he said that the moon [and] generally [the heavenly bodies] are in their nature eternal.
He was the son of Pirithous, as he himself tells us at the beginning of his treatise1 : "These are the words of Alcmaeon of Croton, son of Pirithous, which he spake to Brotinus, Leon and Bathyllus : `Of things invisible, as of mortal things, only the gods have certain knowledge ; but to us, as men, only inference from evidence is possible,' and so on." He held also that the soul is immortal and that it is continuously in motion like the sun.

Heraclitus diss pythagoras

Ἡράκλειτος Βλόσωνος ἤ, ὥς τινες, Ἡράκωντος2 Ἐφέσιος. 

Heraclitus, son of Bloson or, according to some, of Heracon, was a native of Ephesus. 

οὗτος ἤκμαζε μὲν κατὰ τὴν ἐνάτην καὶ ἑξηκοστὴν Ὀλυμπιάδα. 

He flourished in the 69th Olympiad.1 

μεγαλόφρ ων δὲ γέγονε παρ᾽ ὁντιναοῦ καὶ ὑπερόπτης, 

He was lofty-minded beyond all other men,2 and over-weening, 

ὡς καὶ ἐκ τοῦ συγγράμματος αὐτοῦ δῆλον, ἐν ᾧ φησι, 

as is clear from his book in which he says : 

"πολυμαθίη νόον3 οὐ διδάσκει: Ἡσίοδον γὰρ ἂν ἐδίδαξε καὶ Πυθαγόρην, αὖτίς τε Ξενοφάνεά τε καὶ Ἑκαταῖον." 

"Much learning does not teach understanding ; else would it have taught Hesiod and Pythagoras, or, again, Xenophanes and Hecataeus."3 

εἶναι γὰρͅ ιἓν τὸ σοφόν, ἐπίστασθαι γνώμην, ὁτέη ἐκυβέρνησε πάντα διὰ πάντων." 

For "this one thing is wisdom, to understand thought, as that which guides all the world everywhere."4 

τόν τε Ὅμηρον ἔφασκεν ἄξιον ἐκ τῶν ἀγώνων ἐκβάλλεσθαι καὶ ῥαπίζεσθαι, καὶ Ἀρχίλοχον ὁμοίως.

And he used to say that "Homer deserved to be chased out of the lists and beaten with rods, and Archilochus likewise."5
#### 3
ἀναχωρήσας δ᾽ εἰς τὸ ἱερὸν τῆς Ἀρτέμιδος μετὰ τῶν παίδων ἠστραγάλιζε: 

[3] He would retire to the temple of Artemis and play at knuckle-bones with the boys ; 

περιστάντων δ᾽ αὐτὸν τῶν Ἐφεσίων, "τί, ὦ κάκιστοι, θαυμάζετε;" εἶπεν: "ἢ οὐ κρεῖττον τοῦτο ποιεῖν ἢ μεθ᾽ ὑμῶν πολιτεύεσθαι;"

and when the Ephesians stood round him and looked on, "Why, you rascals," he said, "are you astonished? Is it not better to do this than to take part in your civil life ?"

Καὶ τέλος μισανθρωπήσας καὶ ἐκπατήσας ἐν τοῖς ὄρεσι διητᾶτο, πόας σιτούμενος καὶ βοτάνας. 

Finally, he became a hater of his kind and wandered on the mountains, and there he continued to live, making his diet of grass and herbs. 

καὶ μέντοι καὶ διὰ τοῦτο περιτραπεὶς εἰς ὕδερον κατῆλθεν εἰς ἄστυ καὶ τῶν ἰατρῶν αἰνιγματωδῶς ἐπυνθάνετο εἰ δύναιντ᾽ ἐξ ἐπομβρίας αὐχμὸν ποιῆσαι: 

However, when this gave him dropsy, he made his way back to the city and put this riddle to the physicians, whether they were competent to create a drought after heavy rain. 

τῶν δὲ μὴ συνιέντων, αὑτὸν εἰς βουστάσιον κατορύξας τῇ τῶν βολίτων ἀλέᾳ ἤλπισεν ἐξατμισθήσεσθαι. 

They could make nothing of this, whereupon he buried himself in a cowshed, expecting that the noxious damp humour would be drawn out of him by the warmth of the manure. 

οὐδὲν δ᾽ ἀνύων οὐδ᾽ οὕτως, ἐτελεύτα βιοὺς ἔτη ἑξήκοντα.

But, as even this was of no avail, he died at the age of sixty.
#### 5
Γέγονε δὲ θαυμάσιος ἐκ παίδων, ὅτε καὶ νέος ὢν ἔφασκε μηδὲν εἰδέναι, τέλειος μέντοι γενόμενος πάντ᾽ ἐγνωκέναι. 

He was exceptional from his boyhood ; for when a youth he used to say that he knew nothing, although when he was grown up he claimed that he knew everything. 

ἤκουσέ τ᾽ οὐδενός, ἀλλ᾽ αὑτὸν ἔφη διζήσασθαι καὶ μαθεῖν πάντα παρ᾽ ἑαυτοῦ. 

He was nobody's pupil, but he declared that he "inquired of himself,"10 and learned everything from himself. 

Σωτίων δέ φησιν εἰρηκέναι τινὰς Ξενοφάνους αὐτὸν ἀκηκοέναι: λέγειν τε Ἀρίστωνα ἐν τῷ Περὶ Ἡρακλείτου καὶ τὸν ὕδερον αὐτὸν θεραπευθῆναι, ἀποθανεῖν δ᾽ ἄλλῃ νόσῳ. τοῦτο δὲ καὶ Ἱππόβοτός φησι.

Some, however, had said that he had been a pupil of Xenophanes, as we learn from Sotion, who also tells us that Ariston in his book On Heraclitus declares that he was cured of the dropsy and died of another disease. And Hippobotus has the same story.

Τὸ δὲ φερόμενον αὐτοῦ βιβλίον ἐστὶ μὲν ἀπὸ τοῦ συνέχοντος Περὶ φύσεως, διῄρηται δ᾽ εἰς τρεῖς λόγους, εἴς τε τὸν περὶ τοῦ παντὸς καὶ πολιτικὸν καὶ θεολογικόν. 10 

As to the work which passes as his, it is a continuous treatise On Nature, but is divided into three discourses, one on the universe, another on politics, and a third on theology. 
#### 6
[6] ἀνέθηκε δ᾽ αὐτὸ εἰς τὸ τῆς Ἀρτέμιδος ἱερόν, ὡς μέν τινες, ἐπιτηδεύσας ἀσαφέστερον γράψαι, ὅπως οἱ δυνάμενοι <μόνοι> προσίοιεν αὐτῷ καὶ μὴ ἐκ τοῦ δημώδους εὐκαταφρόνητον ᾖ. 

[6] This book he deposited in the temple of Artemis and, according to some, he deliberately made it the more obscure in order that none but adepts should approach it, and lest familiarity should breed contempt. 

τοῦτον δὲ καὶ ὁ Τίμων ὑπογράφει λέγων,

Of our philosopher Timon11 gives a sketch in these words12 :

τοῖς δ᾽ ἔνι κοκκυστής, ὀχλολοίδορος Ἡράκλειτος, αἰνικτὴς ἀνόρουσε.

In their midst uprose shrill, cuckoo-like, a mob-reviler, riddling Heraclitus.

Θεόφραστος δέ φησιν ὑπὸ μελαγχολίας τὰ μὲν ἡμιτελῆ, τὰ δ᾽ ἄλλοτ᾽ ἄλλως ἔχοντα γράψαι. 

Theophrastus puts it down to melancholy that some parts of his work are half-finished, while other parts make a strange medley. 

σημεῖον δ᾽ αὐτοῦ τῆς μεγαλοφροσύνης Ἀντισθένης φησὶν ἐν Διαδοχαῖς: ἐκχωρῆσαι γὰρ τἀδελφῷ τῆς βασιλείας. 

As a proof of his magnanimity Antisthenes in his Successions of Philosophers cites the fact that he renounced his claim to the kingship in favour of his brother. 

τοσαύτην δὲ δόξαν ἔσχε τὸ σύγγραμμα ὡς καὶ αἱρετιστὰς ἀπ᾽ αὐτοῦ γενέσθαι τοὺς κληθέντας Ἡρακλειτείους.

So great fame did his book win that a sect was founded and called the Heracliteans, after him.
#### 7
Ἐδόκει δ᾽ αὐτῷ καθολικῶς μὲν τάδε: 

Here is a general summary of his doctrines. 

ἐκ πυρὸς τὰ πάντα συνεστάναι καὶ εἰς τοῦτο ἀναλύεσθαι: 

All things are composed of fire, and into fire they are again resolved ; 

πάντα δὲ γίνεσθαι καθ᾽ εἱμαρμένην καὶ διὰ τῆς ἐναντιοδρομίας ἡρμόσθαι τὰ ὄντα: 

further, all things come about by destiny, and existent things are brought into harmony by the clash of opposing currents ; 

καὶ πάντα ψυχῶν εἶναι καὶ δαιμόνων πλήρη. 

again, all things are filled with souls and divinities. 

εἴρηκε δὲ καὶ περὶ τῶν ἐν κόσμῳ συνισταμένων πάντων παθῶν, ὅτι τε ὁ ἥλιός ἐστι τὸ μέγεθος οἷος φαίνεται. 

He has also given an account of all the orderly happenings in the universe, and declares the sun to be no larger than it appears. 

λέγεται δὲ καὶ 

Another of his sayings is : 

"ψυχῆς πείρατα ἰὼν οὐκ ἂν ἐξεύροιο, πᾶσαν ἐπιπορευόμενος ὁδόν: οὕτω βαθὺν λόγον ἔχει." 

"Of soul thou shalt never find boundaries, not if thou trackest it on every path ; so deep is its cause."13 

τήν τ᾽ οἴησιν ἱερὰν νόσον ἔλεγε καὶ τὴν ὅρασιν ψεύδεσθαι. 

Self-conceit he used to call a falling sickness (epilepsy) and eyesight a lying sense.14 

λαμπρῶς τ᾽ ἐνίοτε ἐν τῷ συγγράμματι καὶ σαφῶς ἐκβάλλει, ὥστε καὶ τὸν νωθέστατον ῥᾳδίως γνῶναι καὶ δίαρμα ψυχῆς λαβεῖν: 

Sometimes, however, his utterances are clear and distinct, so that even the dullest can easily understand and derive therefrom elevation of soul. 

ἥ τε βραχύτης καὶ τὸ βάρος τῆς ἑρμηνείας ἀσύγκριτον.

For brevity and weightiness his exposition is incomparable.
#### 8
12 [8] Καὶ τὰ ἐπὶ μέρους δὲ αὐτῷ ὧδ᾽ ἔχει τῶν δογμάτων: 

Coming now to his particular tenets, we may state them as follows : 

πῦρ εἶναι στοιχεῖον καὶ πυρὸς ἀμοιβὴν τὰ πάντα, ἀραιώσει καὶ πυκνώσει γινόμενα. 

fire is the element, all things are exchange for fire and come into being by rarefaction and condensation15 ; 

σαφῶς δ᾽ οὐδὲν ἐκτίθεται. 

but of this he gives no clear explanation. 

γίνεσθαί τε πάντα κατ᾽ ἐναντιότητα καὶ ῥεῖν τὰ ὅλα ποταμοῦ δίκην, πεπεράνθαι τε τὸ πᾶν καὶ ἕνα εἶναι κόσμον: 

All things come into being by conflict of opposites, and the sum of things flows like a stream. Further, all that is is limited and forms one world. 

γεννᾶσθαί τε αὐτὸν ἐκ πυρὸς καὶ πάλιν ἐκπυροῦσθαι κατά τινας περιόδους ἐναλλὰξ τὸν σύμπαντα αἰῶνα: 

And it is alternately born from fire and again resolved into fire in fixed cycles to all eternity, 

τοῦτο δὲ γίνεσθαι καθ᾽ εἱμαρμένην. 

and this is determined by destiny. 

τῶν δὲ ἐναντίων τὸ μὲν ἐπὶ τὴν γένεσιν ἄγον καλεῖσθαι πόλεμον καὶ ἔριν, τὸ δ᾽ ἐπὶ τὴν ἐκπύρωσιν ὁμολογίαν καὶ εἰρήνην, καὶ τὴν μεταβολὴν ὁδὸν ἄνω κάτω, τόν τε κόσμον γίνεσθαι κατ᾽ αὐτήν.

Of the opposites that which tends to birth or creation is called war and strife, and that which tends to destruction by fire is called concord and peace.16 Change he called a pathway up and down, and this determines the birth of the world.
#### 9
[9] Πυκνούμενον γὰρ τὸ πῦρ ἐξυγραίνεσθαι συνιστάμενόν τε γίνεσθαι ὕδωρ, πηγνύμενον δὲ τὸ ὕδωρ εἰς γῆν τρέπεσθαι: 

For fire by contracting turns into moisture, and this condensing turns into water ; water again when congealed turns into earth. 

καὶ ταύτην ὁδὸν ἐπὶ τὸ κάτω εἶναι. 

This process he calls the downward path. 

πάλιν τε αὖ τὴν γῆν χεῖσθαι, ἐξ ἧς τὸ ὕδωρ γίνεσθαι, ἐκ δὲ τούτου τὰ λοιπά, σχεδὸν πάντα ἐπὶ τὴν ἀναθυμίασιν ἀνάγων τὴν ἀπὸ τῆς θαλάττης: 

Then again earth is liquefied, and thus gives rise to water, and from water the rest of the series is derived. He reduces nearly everything to exhalation from the sea. 

αὕτη δέ ἐστιν ἡ ἐπὶ τὸ ἄνω ὁδός. 

This process is the upward path. 

γίνεσθαι δ᾽ ἀναθυμιάσεις ἀπό τε γῆς καὶ θαλάττης, ἃς μὲν λαμπρὰς καὶ καθαράς, ἃς δὲ σκοτεινάς. 

Exhalations arise from earth as well as from sea ; those from sea are bright and pure, those from earth dark. 

αὔξεσθαι δὲ τὸ μὲν πῦρ ὑπὸ τῶν λαμπρῶν, τὸ δὲ ὑγρὸν ὑπὸ τῶν ἑτέρων. 

Fire is fed by the bright exhalations, the moist element by the others. 

τὸ δὲ περιέχον ὁποῖόν ἐστιν οὐ δηλοῖ: 

He does not make clear the nature of the surrounding element. 

εἶναι μέντοι ἐν αὐτῷ σκάφας ἐπεστραμμένας κατὰ κοῖλον πρὸς ἡμᾶς, ἐν αἷς ἀθροιζομένας τὰς λαμπρὰς ἀναθυμιάσεις ἀποτελεῖν φλόγας, ἃς εἶναι τὰ ἄστρα. 14 

He says, however, that there are in it bowls with their concavities turned towards us, in which the bright exhalations collect and produce flames. These are the stars. 
#### 10
[10] λαμπροτάτην δὲ εἶναι τὴν τοῦ ἡλίου φλόγα καὶ θερμοτάτην. 

The flame of the sun is the brightest and the hottest ; 

τὰ μὲν γὰρ ἄλλα ἄστρα πλεῖον ἀπέχειν ἀπὸ γῆς καὶ διὰ τοῦτο ἧττον λάμπειν καὶ θάλπειν, τὴν δὲ σελήνην προσγειοτέραν οὖσαν μὴ διὰ τοῦ καθαροῦ φέρεσθαι τόπου. 

the other stars are further from the earth and for that reason give it less light and heat. The moon, which is nearer to the earth, traverses a region which is not pure. 

τὸν μέντοι ἥλιον ἐν διαυγεῖ καὶ ἀμιγεῖ κινεῖσθαι15 καὶ σύμμετρον ἀφ᾽ ἡμῶν ἔχειν διάστημα: 

The sun, however, moves in a clear and untroubled region, and keeps a proportionate distance from us. 

τοιγάρτοι μᾶλλον θερμαίνειν τε καὶ φωτίζειν. 

That is why it gives us more heat and light. 

ἐκλείπειν τε ἥλιον καὶ σελήνην, ἄνω στρεφομένων τῶν σκαφῶν: τούς τε κατὰ μῆνα τῆς σελήνης σχηματισμοὺς γίνεσθαι στρεφομένης ἐν αὐτῇ κατὰ μικρὸν τῆς σκάφης. 

Eclipses of the sun and moon occur when the bowls are turned upwards ; the monthly phases of the moon are due to the bowl turning round in its place little by little. 

ἡμέραν τε καὶ νύκτα γίνεσθαι καὶ μῆνας καὶ ὥρας ἐτείους καὶ ἐνιαυτοὺς ὑετούς τε καὶ πνεύματα καὶ τὰ τούτοις ὅμοια κατὰ τὰς διαφόρους ἀναθυμιάσεις. 16 

Day and night, months, seasons and years, rains and winds and other similar phenomena are accounted for by the various exhalations. 
#### 11
[11] τὴν μὲν γὰρ λαμπρὰν ἀναθυμίασιν φλογωθεῖσαν ἐν τῷ κύκλῳ17 τοῦ ἡλίου ἡμέραν ποιεῖν, τὴν δὲ ἐναντίαν ἐπικρατήσασαν νύκτ᾽ ἀποτελεῖν: 

Thus the bright exhalation, set aflame in the hollow orb of the sun, produces day, the opposite exhalation when it has got the mastery causes night ; 

καὶ ἐκ μὲν τοῦ λαμπροῦ τὸ θερμὸν αὐξόμενον θέρος ποιεῖν, ἐκ δὲ τοῦ σκοτεινοῦ τὸ ὑγρὸν πλεονάζον χειμῶνα ἀπεργάζεσθαι. 

the increase of warmth due to the bright exhalation produces summer, whereas the preponderance of moisture due to the dark exhalation brings about winter. 

ἀκολούθως δὲ τούτοις καὶ περὶ τῶν ἄλλων αἰτιολογεῖ. 

His explanations of other phenomena are in harmony with this. 

περὶ δὲ τῆς γῆς οὐδὲν ἀποφαίνεται ποία τίς ἐστιν, ἀλλ᾽ οὐδὲ περὶ τῶν σκαφῶν. καὶ ταῦτα μὲν ἦν αὐτῷ τὰ δοκοῦντα.

He gives no account of the nature of the earth, nor even of the bowls. These, then, were his opinions.

Τὰ δὲ περὶ Σωκράτους καὶ ὅσα ἐντυχὼν τῷ συγγράμματι εἴποι, κομίσαντος Εὐριπίδου, καθά φησιν Ἀρίστων, ἐν τῷ περὶ Σωκράτους εἰρήκαμεν. 18

The story told by Ariston of Socrates, and his remarks when he came upon the book of Heraclitus, which Euripides brought him, I have mentioned in my Life of Socrates.17

XENOPHANES
Xenophanes, a native of Colophon, the son of Dexius, or, according to Apollodorus, of Orthomenes, is praised by Timon, whose words at all events are:
Xenophanes, not over-proud, perverter of Homer, castigator.

οὗτος ἐκπεσὼν τῆς πατρίδος ἐν Ζάγκλῃ τῆς Σικελίας : : :2 διέτριβε δὲ καὶ ἐν Κατάνῃ. διήκουσε δὲ κατ᾽ ἐνίους μὲν οὐδενός, κατ᾽ ἐνίους δὲ Βότωνος Ἀθηναίου ἤ, ὥς τινες, Ἀρχελάου. καί, ὡς Σωτίων φησί, κατ᾽ Ἀναξίμανδρον ἦν. γέγραφε δὲ καὶ ἐν ἔπεσι καὶ ἐλεγείας καὶ ἰάμβους καθ᾽ Ἡσιόδου καὶ Ὁμήρου, ἐπικόπτων αὐτῶν τὰ περὶ θεῶν εἰρημένα. ἀλλὰ καὶ αὐτὸς ἐρραψῴδει τὰ ἑαυτοῦ. ἀντιδοξάσαι τε λέγεται Θαλῇ καὶ Πυθαγόρᾳ, καθάψασθαι δὲ καὶ Ἐπιμενίδου. μακροβιώτατός τε γέγονεν, ὥς που καὶ αὐτός φησιν:

He was banished from his native city and lived at Zancle in Sicily [and having joined the colony planted at Elea taught there]. He also lived in Catana. According to some he was no man's pupil, according to others he was a pupil of Boton of Athens, or, as some say, of Archelaus. Sotion makes him a contemporary of Anaximander. His writings are in epic metre, as well as elegiacs and iambics attacking Hesiod and Homer and denouncing what they said about the gods. Furthermore he used to recite his own poems. It is stated that he opposed the views of Thales and Pythagoras, and attacked Epimenides also. He lived to a very great age, as his own words somewhere testify:

Seven and sixty are now the years that have been tossing my cares up and down the land of Greece; and there were then twenty and five years more from my birth up, if I know how to speak truly about these things.

Φησὶ δὲ τέτταρα εἶναι τῶν ὄντων στοιχεῖα, κόσμους δ᾽ ἀπείρους, οὐ παραλλακτοὺς δέ. τὰ νέφη συνίστασθαι τῆς ἀφ᾽ ἡλίου ἀτμίδος ἀναφερομένης καὶ αἰρούσης αὐτὰ εἰς τὸ περιέχον. οὐσίαν θεοῦ σφαιροειδῆ, μηδὲν ὅμοιον ἔχουσαν ἀνθρώπῳ: ὅλον δὲ ὁρᾶν καὶ ὅλον ἀκούειν, μὴ μέντοι ἀναπνεῖν: σύμπαντά τε εἶναι νοῦν καὶ φρόνησιν καὶ ἀΐδιον. πρῶτός τε ἀπεφήνατο ὅτι πᾶν τὸ γινόμενον φθαρτόν ἐστι καὶ ἡ ψυχὴ πνεῦμα.

He holds that there are four elements of existent things, and worlds unlimited in number but not overlapping [in time]. Clouds are formed when the vapour from the sun is carried upwards and lifts them into the surrounding air. The substance of God is spherical, in no way resembling man. He is all eye and all ear, but does not breathe; he is the totality of mind and thought, and is eternal. Xenophanes was the first to declare that everything which comes into being is doomed to perish, and that the soul is breath.

1 Πύρρων Ἠλεῖος Πλειστάρχου μὲν ἦν υἱός, καθὰ καὶ Διοκλῆς ἱστορεῖ: ὥς φησι δ᾽ Ἀπολλόδωρος ἐν Χρονικοῖς, πρότερον ἦν ζωγράφος, καὶ ἤκουσε Βρύσωνος τοῦ Στίλπωνος, ὡς Ἀλέξανδρος ἐν Διαδοχαῖς, εἶτ᾽ Ἀναξάρχου, ξυνακολουθῶν πανταχοῦ, ὡς καὶ τοῖς Γυμνοσοφισταῖς ἐν Ἰνδίᾳ συμμίξαι καὶ τοῖς Μάγοις. ὅθεν γενναιότατα δοκεῖ φιλοσοφῆσαι, τὸ τῆς ἀκαταληψίας καὶ ἐποχῆς εἶδος εἰσαγαγών, ὡς Ἀσκάνιος ὁ Ἀβδηρίτης φησίν: οὐδὲν γὰρ ἔφασκεν οὔτε καλὸν οὔτ᾽ αἰσχρὸν οὔτε δίκαιον οὔτ᾽ ἄδικον: καὶ ὁμοίως ἐπὶ πάντων μηδὲν εἶναι τῇ ἀλῃθείᾳ, νόμῳ δὲ καὶ ἔθει πάντα τοὺς ἀνθρώπους πράττειν: οὐ γὰρ μᾶλλον τόδε ἢ τόδε εἶναι ἕκαστον.

2 Ἀκόλουθος δ᾽ ἦν καὶ τῷ βίῳ, μηδὲν ἐκτρεπόμενος μηδὲ φυλαττόμενος, ἅπαντα ὑφιστάμενος, ἁμάξας, εἰ τύχοι, καὶ κρημνοὺς καὶ κύνας καὶ ὅλως μηδὲν ταῖς αἰσθήσεσιν ἐπιτρέπων. σώζεσθαι μέντοι, καθά φασιν οἱ περὶ τὸν Καρύστιον Ἀντίγονον, ὑπὸ τῶν γνωρίμων παρακολουθούντων. Αἰνεσίδημος δέ φησι φιλοσοφεῖν μὲν αὐτὸν κατὰ τὸν τῆς ἐποχῆς λόγον, μὴ μέντοι γ᾽ ἀπροοράτως ἕκαστα πράττειν. ὁ δὲ πρὸς τὰ ἐνενήκοντα ἔτη κατεβίω.

Ἀντίγονος δέ φησιν ὁ Καρύστιος ἐν τῷ Περὶ Πύρρωνος τάδε περὶ αὐτοῦ, ὅτι τὴν ἀρχὴν ἄδοξός τ᾽ ἦν καὶ πένης καὶ ζωγράφος. σώζεσθαί τ᾽ αὐτοῦ

ἐν Ἤλιδι ἐν τῷ γυμνασίῳ λαμπαδιστὰς μετρίως ἔχοντας.
