# Madhyamaka
Section 
(Volume 30) 15 texts on Madhyamaka thought. The Madhyamaka texts of the Chinese Canon are considerably different from the Tibetan renditions of the same system of thought. The Chinese collection consists mostly of earlier works. The Chinese Canon does not contain as many works or as many schools of this system as the Tibetan Canon

XV. 
# Yogacara
Section (Volumes 30-31), 19 texts-contains a very complete collection of this system of thought

XVI. Collection of 
# Treatises 
(Volume 2): 65 Texts on miscellaneous works on logic and other matters The Hetuvidva which is closely connected with Vijnanavada (Yogacara school), is not fully translated in the Chinese Canon and cannot compare favorably with the works of Dignaga and Dharmakirti collected in the Tibetan Canon.
