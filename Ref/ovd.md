Orphei mors.
  
“DEATH OF ORPHEUS

 
Carmine dum tali silvas animosque ferarum

Threicius vates et saxa sequentia ducit,

ecce nurus Ciconum, tectae lymphata ferinis

pectora velleribus, tumuli de vertice cernunt

Orphea percussis sociantem carmina nervis.   5

E quibus una, leves iactato crine per auras,

“en,” ait “en hic est nostri contemptor!” et hastam

vatis Apollinei vocalia misit in ora,

quae foliis praesuta notam sine vulnere fecit;


“While with his songs, Orpheus, the bard of Thrace,

allured the trees, the savage animals,

and even the insensate rocks, to follow him;

Ciconian matrons, with their raving breasts

concealed in skins of forest animals,

from the summit of a hill observed him there,

attuning love songs to a sounding harp.

One of those women, as her tangled hair

was tossed upon the light breeze shouted, “See!

Here is the poet who has scorned our love!”

Then hurled her spear at the melodious mouth

of great Apollo’s bard: but the spear’s point,

trailing in flight a garland of fresh leaves,

made but a harmless bruise and wounded not.



alterius telum lapis est, qui missus in ipso   10

aere concentu victus vocisque lyraeque est

ac veluti supplex pro tam furialibus ausis

ante pedes iacuit. 


“The weapon of another was a stone,

which in the very air was overpowered

by the true harmony of his voice and lyre,

and so disabled lay before his feet,

as asking pardon for that vain attempt.


 
Sed enim temeraria crescunt

bella modusque abiit, insanaque regnat Erinys.

Cunctaque tela forent cantu mollita, sed ingens   15

clamor et infracto Berecyntia tibia cornu

tympanaque et plausus et Bacchei ululatus

obstrepuere sono citharae: tum denique saxa

non exauditi rubuerunt sanguine vatis.


“The madness of such warfare then increased.

All moderation is entirely lost,

and a wild Fury overcomes the right.—

although their weapons would have lost all force,

subjected to the power of Orpheus’ harp,

the clamorous discord of their boxwood pipes,

the blaring of their horns, their tambourines

and clapping hands and Bacchanalian yells,

with hideous discords drowned his voice and harp.—

at last the stones that heard his song no more

fell crimson with the Thracian poet’s blood.

 

Ac primum attonitas etiamnum voce canentis  20

innumeras volucres anguesque agmenque ferarum

Maenades, Orphei titulum, rapuere, theatri.

Inde cruentatis vertuntur in Orphea dextris

et coeunt ut aves, si quando luce vagantem

noctis avem cernunt. Structoque utrimque theatro   25

ceu matutina cervus periturus harena

praeda canum est, vatemque petunt et fronde virentes

coniciunt thyrsos non haec in munera factos.


“Before his life was taken, the maenads turned

their threatening hands upon the many birds,

which still were charmed by Orpheus as he sang,

the serpents, and the company of beasts—

fabulous audience of that worshipped bard.

And then they turned on him their blood-stained hands:

and flocked together swiftly, as wild birds,

which, by some chance, may see the bird of night

beneath the sun. And as the savage dogs

rush on the doomed stag, loosed some bright fore-noon,

on blood-sand of the amphitheatre;

they rushed against the bard, with swift

hurled thyrsi which, adorned with emerald leaves

had not till then been used for cruelty.

 

Hae glaebas, illae direptos arbore ramos,

pars torquent silices. Neu desint tela furori,   30

forte boves presso subigebant vomere terram,

nec procul hinc multo fructum sudore parantes

dura lacertosi fodiebant arva coloni.

Agmine qui viso fugiunt operisque relinquunt

arma sui, vacuosque iacent dispersa per agros   35

sarculaque rastrique graves longique ligones.


“And some threw clods, and others branches torn

from trees; and others threw flint stones at him,

and, that no lack of weapons might restrain

their savage fury then, not far from there

by chance they found some oxen which turned up

the soil with ploughshares, and in fields nearby

were strong-armed peasants, who with eager sweat

worked for the harvest as they dug hard fields;

and all those peasants, when they saw the troop

of frantic women, ran away and left

their implements of labor strown upon

deserted fields—harrows and heavy rakes

and their long spades.

 

Quae postquam rapuere ferae cornuque minaci

divulsere boves, ad vatis fata recurrunt

Tendentemque manus et in illo tempore primum

inrita dicentem nec quicquam voce moventem   40

sacrilegae perimunt. Perque os, pro Iuppiter! illud

auditum saxis intellectumque ferarum

sensibus in ventos anima exhalata recessit.


“After the savage mob

had seized upon those implements, and torn

to pieces oxen armed with threatening horns,

they hastened to destroy the harmless bard,

devoted Orpheus; and with impious hate,

murdered him, while his out-stretched hands implored

their mercy—the first and only time his voice

had no persuasion. O great Jupiter!

Through those same lips which had controlled the rocks

and which had overcome ferocious beasts,

his life breathed forth, departed in the air.

 

Te maestae volucres, Orpheu, te turba ferarum,

te rigidi silices, tua carmina saepe secutae   45

fleverunt silvae, positis te frondibus arbor

tonsa comas luxit. Lacrimis quoque flumina dicunt

increvisse suis, obstrusaque carbasa pullo

naides et dryades passosque habuere capillos.


“The mournful birds, the stricken animals,

the hard stones and the weeping woods, all these

that often had followed your inspiring voice,

bewailed your death; while trees dropped their green leaves,

mourning for you, as if they tore their hair.

They say sad rivers swelled with their own tears—

naiads and dryads with dishevelled hair

wore garments of dark color.

 

Membra iacent diversa locis. Caput, Hebre, lyramque   50

excipis, et (mirum!) medio dum labitur amne,

flebile nescio quid queritur lyra, flebile lingua

murmurat exanimis, respondent flebile ripae.

 
“His torn limbs

were scattered in strange places. Hebrus then

received his head and harp—and, wonderful!

While his loved harp was floating down the stream,

it mourned for him beyond my power to tell.

His tongue though lifeless, uttered a mournful sound

and mournfully the river’s banks replied:



Iamque mare invectae flumen populare relinquunt

et Methymnaeae potiuntur litore Lesbi.   55

Hic ferus expositum peregrinis anguis harenis

os petit et sparsos stillanti rore capillos.

Tandem Phoebus adest morsusque inferre parantem

arcet et in lapidem rictus serpentis apertos

congelat et patulos, ut erant, indurat hiatus.   60


onward borne by the river to the sea

they left their native stream and reached the shore

of Lesbos at Methymna. Instantly,

a furious serpent rose to attack the head

of Orpheus, cast up on that foreign sand—

the hair still wet with spray. Phoebus at last

appeared and saved the head from that attack:

before the serpent could inflict a sting,

he drove it off, and hardened its wide jaws

to rigid stone.

 

Umbra subit terras et quae loca viderat ante,

cuncta recognoscit quaerensque per arva piorum

invenit Eurydicen cupidisque amplectitur ulnis.

Hic modo coniunctis spatiantur passibus ambo,

nunc praecedentem sequitur, nunc praevius anteit   65

Eurydicenque suam iam tutus respicit Orpheus.


“Meanwhile the fleeting shade

of Orpheus had descended under earth:

remembering now those regions that he saw

when there before, he sought Eurydice

through fields frequented by the blest; and when

he found her, folded her in eager arms.

Then lovingly they wandered side by side,

or he would follow when she chose to lead,

or at another time he walked in front,

looking back, safely,—at Eurydice.

  

Non impune tamen scelus hoc sinit esse Lyaeus,

amissoque dolens sacrorum vate suorum

protinus in silvis matres Edonidas omnes,

quae videre nefas, torta radice ligavit.   70


“Bacchus would not permit the wickedness

of those who slaughtered Orpheus to remain

unpunished. Grieving for the loss of his

loved bard of sacred rites, at once he bound

with twisted roots the feet of everyone

of those Edonian women who had caused

the crime of Orpheus’ death.



Quippe pedum digitos, in quantum est quaeque secuta,

traxit et in solidam detrusit acumina terram,

utque suum laqueis, quos callidus abdidit auceps,

crus ubi commisit volucris sensitque teneri,

plangitur ac trepidans adstringit vincula motu:   75

sic, ut quaeque solo defixa cohaeserat harum,

exsternata fugam frustra temptabat; at illam

lenta tenet radix exsultantemque coercet,

dumque ubi sint digiti, dum pes ubi, quaerit, et ungues,

adspicit in teretes lignum succedere suras,   80

et conata femur maerenti plangere dextra,

robora percussit: pectus quoque robora fiunt,

robora sunt umeri, porrectaque bracchia veros

esse putes ramos, et non fallere putando.


“Their toes grew long.

He thrust the sharp points in the solid earth.

As when a bird entangled in a snare,

hid by the cunning fowler, knows too late

that it is held, then vainly beats its wings,

and fluttering only makes more tight the noose

with every struggle; so each woman-fiend

whose feet were sinking in the soil, when she

attempted flight, was held by deepening roots.

And while she looks down where her toes and nails

and feet should be, she sees wood growing up

from them and covering all her graceful legs.

Full of delirious grief, endeavoring

to smite with right hand on her changing thigh,

she strikes on solid oak. Her tender breast

and shoulders are transformed to rigid oak.

You would declare that her extended arms

are real branches of a forest tree,

and such a thought would be the very truth.”

(trans. Brookes More, 1922)

Pythagoras.
60Vir fuit hic, ortu Samius, sed fugerat una
et Samon et dominos odioque tyrannidis exsul
sponte erat, isque, licet caeli regione remotos,
mente deos adiit et quae natura negabat
visibus humanis, oculis ea pectoris hausit,

PYTHAGORAS TEACHES HIS PHILOSOPHY
Here lived a man, by birth a Samian.
He had fled from Samos and the ruling class,
a voluntary exile, for his hate
against all tyranny. He had the gift
of holding mental converse with the gods,
who live far distant in the highth of heaven;
and all that Nature has denied to man
and human vision, he reviewed with eyes
of his enlightened soul. 
### 65
cumque animo et vigili perspexerat omnia cura,
in medium discenda dabat coetusque silentum
dictaque mirantum magni primordia mundi
et rerum causas et, quid natura, docebat,
quid deus, unde nives, quae fulminis esset origo,

And, when he had
examined all things in his careful mind
with watchful study, he released his thoughts
to knowledge of the public.
He would speak
to crowds of people, silent and amazed,
while he revealed to them the origin
of this vast universe, the cause of things,
what is nature, what a god, whence came the snow,
the cause of lightning—
### 70
Iuppiter an venti discussa nube tonarent,
quid quateret terras, qua sidera lege mearent —
et quodcumque latet; primusque animalia mensis
arguit imponi, primus quoque talibus ora
docta quidem solvit, sed non et credita, verbis:

was it Jupiter
or did the winds, that thundered when the cloud
was rent asunder, cause the lightning flash?
What shook the earth, what laws controlled the stars
as they were moved—and every hidden thing
he was the first man to forbid the use
of any animal's flesh as human food,
he was the first to speak with learned lips,
though not believed in this, exhorting them.—

### 75
“Parcite, mortales, dapibus temerare nefandis
corpora! Sunt fruges, sunt deducentia ramos
pondere poma suo tumidaeque in vitibus uvae,
sunt herbae dulces, sunt quae mitescere flamma
mollirique queant; nec vobis lacteus umor

“No, mortals,” he would say, “Do not permit
pollution of your bodies with such food,
for there are grain and good fruits which bear down
the branches by their weight, and ripened grapes
upon the vines, and herbs—those sweet by nature
and those which will grow tender and mellow with
a fire, and flowing milk is not denied,

### 80
eripitur, nec mella thymi redolentia flore:
prodiga divitias alimentaque mitia tellus
suggerit atque epulas sine caede et sanguine praebet.
Carne ferae sedant ieiunia, nec tamen omnes:
quippe equus et pecudes armentaque gramine vivunt.

nor honey, redolent of blossoming thyme.
“The lavish Earth yields rich and healthful food
affording dainties without slaughter, death,
and bloodshed. Dull beasts delight to satisfy
their hunger with torn flesh; and yet not all:
horses and sheep and cattle live on grass.

### 85
At quibus ingenium est inmansuetumque ferumque,
Armeniae tigres iracundique leones
cumque lupis ursi, dapibus cum sanguine gaudent.
Heu quantum scelus est in viscera viscera condi
congestoque avidum pinguescere corpore corpus

But all the savage animals—the fierce
Armenian tigers and ferocious lions,
and bears, together with the roving wolves—
delight in viands reeking with warm blood.
“Oh, ponder a moment such a monstrous crime—
vitals in vitals gorged, 
### 90
alteriusque animantem animantis vivere leto!
Scilicet in tantis opibus, quas optima matrum
terra parit, nil te nisi tristia mandere saevo
vulnera dente iuvat ritusque referre Cyclopum,
nec, nisi perdideris alium, placare voracis

one greedy body
fattening with plunder of another's flesh,
a living being fed on another's life!
In that abundance, which our Earth, the best
of mothers, will afford have you no joy,
unless your savage teeth can gnaw
the piteous flesh of some flayed animal
to reenact the Cyclopean crime?
### 95
et male morati poteris ieiunia ventris?
At vetus illa aetas, cui fecimus aurea nomen,
fetibus arboreis et, quas humus educat, herbis
fortunata fuit nec polluit ora cruore.
Tunc et aves tutae movere per aera pennas,

And can you not appease the hungry void—
the perverted craving of a stomach's greed,
unless you first destroy another life?
“That age of old time which is given the name
of ‘Golden,’ was so blest in fruit of trees,
and in the good herbs which the earth produced
that it never would pollute the mouth with blood.
The birds then safely moved their wings in air,

### 100
et lepus impavidus mediis erravit in arvis,
nec sua credulitas piscem suspenderat hamo:
cuncta sine insidiis nullamque timentia fraudem
plenaque pacis erant. Postquam non utilis auctor
victibus invidit, quisquis fuit ille, deorum

the timid hares would wander in the fields
with no fear, and their own credulity
had not suspended fishes from the hook.
All life was safe from treacherous wiles,
fearing no injury, a peaceful world.
“After that time some one of ill advice
(it does not matter who it might have been)
envied the ways of lions and gulped into
his greedy paunch stuff from a carcass vile.

### 105
corporeasque dapes avidam demersit in alvum,
fecit iter sceleri, primoque e caede ferarum
incaluisse potest maculatum sanguine ferrum
(idque satis fuerat), nostrumque petentia letum
corpora missa neci salva pietate fatemur:

He opened the foul paths of wickedness.
It may be that in killing beasts of prey
our steel was for the first time warmed with blood.
And that could be defended, for I hold
that predatory creatures which attempt
destruction of mankind, are put to death
without evasion of the sacred laws:
but, though with justice they are put to death,
that cannot be a cause for eating them.

### 110
sed quam danda neci, tam non epulanda fuerunt.
Longius inde nefas abiit, et prima putatur
hostia sus meruisse mori, quia semina pando
eruerit rostro spemque interceperit anni.
Vite caper morsa Bacchi mactatus ad aras

“This wickedness went further; and the sow
was thought to have deserved death as the first
of victims, for with her long turned-up snout
she spoiled the good hope of a harvest year.
The ravenous goat, that gnawed a sprouting vine,
was led for slaughter to the altar fires
of angry Bacchus. 
### 115
dicitur ultoris; nocuit sua culpa duobus!
Quid meruistis oves, placidum pecus, inque tuendos
natum homines, pleno quae fertis in ubere nectar,
mollia quae nobis vestras velamina lanas
praebetis vitaque magis quam morte iuvatis?

It was their own fault
that surely caused the ruin of those two.
“But why have sheep deserved sad destiny,
harmless and useful for the good of man
with nectar in full udders? 
Their soft wool
affords the warmest coverings for our use,
their life and not their death would help us more.
### 120
Quid meruere boves, animal sine fraude dolisque,
innocuum, simplex, natum tolerare labores?
Inmemor est demum nec frugum munere dignus,
qui potuit curvi dempto modo pondere aratri
ruricolam mactare suum, qui trita labore

Why have the oxen of the field deserved
a sad end—innocent, without deceit,
and harmless, without guile, born to endure
hard labor? 
Without gratitude is he,
unworthy of the gift of harvest fields,
who, after he relieved his worker from
weight of the curving plow could butcher him,
### 125
illa, quibus totiens durum renovaverat arvum,
tot dederat messes, percussit colla securi.
Nec satis est, quod tale nefas committitur: ipsos
inscripsere deos sceleri, numenque supernum
caede laboriferi credunt gaudere iuvenci.

could sever with an axe that toil worn neck,
by which so often with hard work the ground
had been turned up, so many harvests reared.
For some, even crimes like these are not enough,
they have imputed to the gods themselves
abomination—they believe a god
in heaven above, rejoices at the death
of a laborious ox.
### 130
Victima labe carens et praestantissima forma
(nam placuisse nocet) vittis insignis et auro
sistitur ante aras auditque ignara precantem
imponique suae videt inter cornua fronti,
quas coluit, fruges percussaque sanguine cultros

“A victim free
of blemish and most beautiful in form
(perfection brings destruction) is adorned
with garlands and with gilded horns before
the altar. In his ignorance he hears
one praying, and he sees the very grain
he labored to produce, fixed on his head
between the horns, and felled, he stains with blood
the knife which just before he may have seen
### 135
inficit in liquida praevisos forsitan unda.
Protinus ereptas viventi pectore fibras
inspiciunt mentesque deum scrutantur in illis:
unde (fames homini vetitorum tanta ciborum!)
audetis vesci, genus o mortale? Quod, oro,

reflected in clear water. Instantly
they snatch out entrails from his throbbing form,
and seek in them intentions of the gods.
Then, in your lust for a forbidden food
you will presume to batten on his flesh,
O race of mortals! Do not eat such food!
Give your attention to my serious words;
### 140
ne facite, et monitis animos advertite nostris!
Cumque boum dabitis caesorum membra palato,
mandere vos vestros scite et sentite colonos.
Et quoniam deus ora movet, sequar ora moventem
rite deum Delphosque meos ipsumque recludam

and, when you next present the slaughtered flesh
of oxen to your palates, know and feel
that you gnaw your fellow tillers of the soil.
“And, since a god impels me to speak out,
I will obey the god who urges me,
and will disclose to you the heavens above,

### 145
aethera et augustae reserabo oracula mentis.
Magna nec ingeniis investigata priorum
quaeque diu latuere, canam; iuvat ire per alta
astra, iuvat terris et inerti sede relicta
nube vehi validique umeris insistere Atlantis

and I will even reveal the oracles
of the Divine Will. I will sing to you
of things most wonderful, which never were
investigated by the intellects
of ancient times and things which have been long
concealed from man. In fancy I delight
to float among the stars or take my stand
on mighty Atlas' shoulders, and to look
### 150
palantesque homines passim ac rationis egentes
despectare procul trepidosque obitumque timentes
sic exhortari seriemque evolvere fati:

afar down on men wandering here and there—
afraid in life yet dreading unknown death,
and in these words exhort them and reveal
the sequence of events ordained by fate!
### 155
### 160
Ipse ego (nam memini) Troiani tempore belli
Panthoides Euphorbus eram, cui pectore quondam
haesit in adverso gravis hasta minoris Atridae:
cognovi clipeum, laevae gestamina nostrae,
nuper Abanteis templo Iunonis in Argis.

“I can declare, for I remember well,
that in the days of the great Trojan War,
I was Euphorbus, son of Panthous.
In my opposing breast was planted then
the heavy spear-point of the younger son
of Atreus. Not long past I recognised
the shield, once burden of my left arm, where
it hung in Juno's temple at ancient Argos,
the realm of Abas.
