### 1.7
Śiva in his form as five-faced Sadāśiva, performs the five acts ( pañcakṛtya) of the creation, maintenance, and destruction of the universe, concealing himself and revealing himself to devotees (Tat Prak 1.7). 
### 1.15
This liberation is attained with the grace ( anugraha) of Śiva through initiation ( dīkṣā) by a teacher in whose body Śiva has become established ( ācāryamūrtistha) (Tat Prak 1.15; Hulin 1980, 115–117). 

Through initiation and the subsequent actions of daily and occasional rituals performed throughout his life, the impurity, which is a substance ( dravya) covering the soul, is gradually removed and the aspirant finally achieves liberation a death through the descent of Śiva’s grace ( śaktipāta). Once liberated, the soul does not merge with Śiva, because of their ontological distinction, but rather becomes equal to Śiva ( śivatulya), possessing all of Śiva’s powers of omniscience and omnipotence, but remaining eternally distinct (Davis 1991, 83–111; Sanderson 1995, 39–40).

### 6.1
The self or “beast” ( paśu) is eternally distinct from Śiva and bound within the cosmos or “bond” ( pāśa), in the cycle of birth and death by impurity ( mala), action ( karma), and the material substratum of the cosmos ( māyā). Śiva performs the five acts for his play ( krīḍa) and for the liberation of beings (Tat Prak 6.1).
