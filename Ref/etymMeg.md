SUMMARY: Fragment 63 states that the Giants were born from Earth (Gaia) and the blood of Uranus, this from the The Sacred Logos in 24 Rhapsodies by Orpheus.

63. (44) Ἐτυμολογικὸν Μέγα 231, 21 s. Γίγας (Natalis Comes Mytholog. Ven. 1568, 194). Edo ex Etym. genuin. (A [Vat. 1818], B [Marc.]), cuius lectionem mecum comiter communicavit R. Retzenstein.:

Γίγας παρὰ τὸ ἐκ τῆς γῆς ἰέναι· οἷον·

“Giant comes from the Earth; as for instance:

οὓς καλέουσι Γίγαντας ἐπώνυμον ἐν μακάρεσσιν,

‘They call them Yígandæs (Giants, Γίγαντες) by name among the happy (Gods),

οὕνεκα Γῆς ἐγένοντο, καὶ αἵματος Οὐρανίοιο.

because they were born from Yi (Earth, Γῆ), and the blood of Ouranós (Heaven, Οὐρανός).’

οὕτως Ὀρφεὺς ἐν τῷ Νʹ [1] τοῦ Ἱεροῦ λόγου.

“In this way Orphéfs (Ὀρφεὺς) (spoke) in the 50th of the Sacred Logos (Ιερός Λόγος σε 24 Ραψωδίες). (trans. by the author)

[1] ἐν τῷ Νʹ in cod. A] numerus hand dubie depravatus (“the number clearly corrupted”), ἐν τῷ ὀγδόῳ τοῦ Ἱεροῦ λόγου praebet Sylb. This would read, “in the fourth (book) of the Sacred Logos.”
