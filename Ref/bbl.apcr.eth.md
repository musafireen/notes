4:29 At the end of the nineteenth jubilee, during the seventh week — in its sixth year [930] — Adam died. All his children buried him in the land where he had been created. He was the first to be buried in the ground. 
#### 4:30

4:30 He lacked 70 years from 1000 years because 1000 years are one day in the testimony of heaven. For this reason it was written regarding the tree of knowledge: ‘On the day that you eat from it you will die’. Therefore he did not complete the years of this day because he died during it.

11:1 In the thirty-fifth jubilee, during the third week — in its first year [1681] — Ragew married a woman whose name was Ara, the daughter of Ur, Kesed’s son. She gave birth to a son for him, and he named him Serug in the seventh year of this week [1687].

11:2 ወበዝ ኢዮቤልዉ ወጠኑ ውሉደ ኖኅ ይትቃተሉ ለፄውዎ ወለቀቲል አሐዱ አሐዱ እኅዋሁ ወለክዒወ ደመ ሰብእ ዲበ ምድር ወለበሊዐ ደም ወለሐኒጸ አህጉር ጽኑዓት ወጥቅም ወማኅፈድ ወለተልዕሎ ብእሲ ላዕለ ሕዝብ ወለሰዪመ መቅድመ መንግሥት። ወለሐዊረ ፀብእ ሕዝብ ቅድመ ሕዝብ ወአሕዛብ ቅድመ አሕዛብ። ወሀገር ቅድመ ሀገር ወኵሉ ለአእክዮ ወለአጥርዮ ንዋየ ሐቅል ወለምህሮ ውሉዶሙ ጸብአ። ወአኀዙ ይፄውዉ ሀገር ለሀገር ወለሠዪጦ ለግብርና ወለአመትና። 

11:2 During this jubilee Noah’s children began to fight one another, to take captives, and to kill one another; to shed human blood on the earth, to consume blood; to build fortified cities, walls, and towers; men to elevate themselves over peoples, to set up the first kingdoms; to go to war — people against people, nations against nations, city against city; and everyone to do evil, to acquire weapons, and to teach warfare to their sons. City began to capture city and to sell male and female slaves.

11:3 ወሐነጸ ኡድ ወልደ ኬሴድ ሀገረ አራሃ እንተ ከልዴዎን ወሰመየ ስማ በስመ ዚአሁ ወበስመ አቡሁ 

11:3 Ur, Kesed’s son, built the city of Ara of the Chaldeans. He named it after himself and his father.

11:4 They made molten images for themselves. Each one would worship the idol which he had made as his own molten image. They began to make statues, images, and unclean things; the spirits of the savage ones were helping and misleading (them) so that they would commit sins, impurities, and transgression.

11:5 ወመኰንን ወስቴማ ይኄይል ለግብረ ዝንቱ ኵሉ ወይፌኑ በእደ መናፍስት ለእለ ተውህቡ ታሕተ እዴሁ ለገቢረ ኵሉ ጌጋይ ወኃጢአት ወኵሉ አበሳ ለአማስኖ ወለአሕጕሎ ወለክዒወ ደም ዲበ ምድር። 

11:5 Prince Mastema was exerting his power in effecting all these actions and, by means of the spirits, he was sending to those who were placed under his control (the ability) to commit every (kind of) error and sin and every (kind of) transgression; to corrupt, to destroy, and to shed blood on the earth. 
#### 6
11:6 በእንተዝ ተጸውዐ ስሙ ለሴሩክ ሴሩክ እስመ ተመይጠ ኵሉ ለገቢረ ኵሉ ኃጢአት።

11:6 For this reason Serug was named Serug: because everyone turned to commit every (kind of) sin.

11:7 He grew up and settled in Ur of the Chaldeans near the father of his wife’s mother. He was a worshiper of idols. During the thirty-sixth jubilee, in the fifth week, in its first year [1744], he married a woman whose name was Melcha, the daughter of Kaber, the daughter of his father’s brother.

11:8 She gave birth to Nahor for him during the first year of this week [1744]. He grew up and settled in Ur — in the one that is the Ur of the Chaldeans. His father taught him the studies of Chaldeans: to practice divination and to augur by the signs of the sky.

11:9 ወበሠላሳ ወሰብዓቱ ኢዮቤልዉ በሱባዔ ሳድስ በአሐዱ ዓመቱ ሎቱ ነሥአ ብእሲተ ወስማ ኢያስካ ወለተ ኔስታግ ዘከለዳዊያን 

11:9 During the thirty-seventh jubilee, in the sixth week, in its first year [1800], he married a woman whose name was lyaseka, the daughter of Nestag of the Chaldeans. 
10
11:10 ወወለደት ሎቱ ታራሃ በዓመት ሳብዕ ለዝ ሱባዔ።

11:10 She gave birth to Terah for him in the seventh year of this week [1806].
#### 11

11:11 Then Prince Mastema sent ravens and birds to eat the seed which would be planted in the ground and to destroy the land in order to rob mankind of their labors. Before they plowed in the seed, the ravens would pick (it) from the surface of the ground. 
12
11:12 በእንተዝ ጽውዐ ስሞ ታራ። እስመ ያስተጼንስዎሙ ቋዓት ወአዕዋፍ ወይበልዑ ሎሙ ዘርኦሙ። 

11:12 For this reason he named him Terah: because the ravens and birds reduced them to povery and ate their seed. 
13
11:13 ወአኀዙ ዓመታት ይዕበሩ እምቅድመ ገጾሙ ለአዕዋፍ ወኵሎ ፍሬ ዕፅ ይበልዑ እምአእዋም በኃይል ዐቢይ እመ ክህሉ አድኅኖ ኅዳጠ እምኵሉ ፍሬ ምድር በመዋዕሊሆሙ።

11:13 The years began to be unfruitful due to the birds. They would eat all the fruit of the trees from the orchards. During their time, if they were able to save a little of all the fruit of the earth, it was with great effort.
#### 14
11:14 ወበዝ ሠላሳ ወተስዓቱ ኢዮቤልዉ በሱባዔ ካልእ በቀዳሚ ዓመት። ነሥአ ሎቱ ታራ ብእሲተ ወስማ ኤድና ወለተ አብራም ወለተ እኅተ አቡሁ ሎቱ ብእሲተ 

11:14 During the thirty-ninth jubilee, in the second week, in the first year [1870], Terah married a woman whose name was Edna, the daughter of Abram, the daughter of his father’s sister. 
#### 15
11:15 ወበዓመት ሳብዕ ለዝ ሱባዔ ወለደት ሎቱ ወልደ። ወጸውዐ ስሞ አብራም በስመ አቡሃ ለእሙ እስመ ሞተ ዘእንበለ ይፀነስ ወልደ ወለቱ። 

11:15 In the seventh year of this week [1876] she gave birth to a son for him, and he named him Abram after his mother’s father because he had died before his daughter’s son was conceived. 
#### 16
11:16 ወአኀዘ ሕፃን ያእምር ስሕተተ ምድር ከመ ኵሉ ይስሕት በድኅሬሆሙ ለግልፎ ወድኅረ ርኵስ። ወመሀሮ አቡሁ መጽሐፈ ወወልደ ክልኤ ሱባዔ ዓመት ውእቱ ወተፈልጠ እምድኅረ አቡሁ ከመ ኢይስግድ ምስሌሁ ለጣዖት። 

11:16 The child began to realize the errors of the earth — that everyone was going astray after the statues and after impurity. His father taught him (the art of) writing. When he was two weeks of years [= 14 years], he separated from his father in order not to worship idols with him. 
#### 17
11:17 ወአኀዝ ይጸሊ ኀበ ፈጣሬ ኵሉ ከመ ያድኅኖ እምስሕተተ ውሉደ ሰብእ። ወከመ ኢይረድ መክፈልቱ ውስተ ስሒት ድኅረ ርኵስ ወምናኔ።

11:17 He began to pray to the creator of all that he would save him from the errors of mankind and that it might not fall to his share to go astray after impurity and wickedness.
#### 18
11:18 ወበጽሐ ጊዜ ዘርእ ለዘሪእ ውስተ ምድር። ወወፅኡ ኵሎሙ ኅቡረ ከመ ይዕቀቡ ዘርአ እምገጸ ቋዓት። ወወፅአ አብራም ምሰለ እለ ወፅኡ ሕፃን ወልደ ዐሠርቱ ወአርባዕቱ ዓመት። 

11:18 When the time for planting seeds in the ground arrived, all of them went out together to guard the seed from the ravens. Abram — a child of 14 years — went out with those who were going out. 
19
11:19 ወደመና ቋዓት መጽኡ ከመ ይብልዑ ዘርአ ወአብራም ይረውጽ አንፃሪሆሙ ዘእንበለ ይንበሩ ውስተ ምድር ወይኬልሕ ላዕሌሆሙ ዘእንበለ ይንበሩ ዲበ ምድር ለበሊዐ ዘርእ ወይብል ኢትረዱ ግብኡ ውስተ መካን ኀበ ወፃእክሙ ወተመይጡ 

11:19 As a cloud of ravens came to eat the seed, Abram would run at them before they could settle on the ground. He would shout at them before they could settle on the ground to eat the seed and would say: ‘Do not come down; return to the place from which you came’! And they returned. 
20
11:20 ወገብረ በይእቲ ዕለት ለደመና ቋዓት ሰብዓ ወኢነበረ እምኵሉ ቋዓት ውስተ ኵሉ ገራውህ ኀበ ሀሎ አብራም ህየ ወኢአሐዱ። 

11:20 That day he did (this) to the cloud of ravens 70 times. Not a single raven remained in any of the fields where Abram was. 
21
11:21 ወይሬእይዎ ኵሎሙ እለ ምስሌሁ ውስተ ኵሉ ገራውህ እንዘ ይኬልሕ ወኵሉ ቋዓት ተመይጡ። ወዐብየ ስሙ በኵሉ ምደረ ከለዴዎን። 

11:21 All who were with him in any of the fields would see him shouting: then all of the ravens returned (to their place). His reputation grew large throughout the entire land of the Chaldeans. 
22
11:22 ወመጽኡ ኀቤሁ በዓመት ዝንቱ ኵሎሙ እለ ይዘርኡ ወሀሎ የሐውር ምስሌሆሙ እስከ አመ የሐልቅ ጊዜ ዘርእ ወዘርኡ ምድሮሙ። ወአብኡ በውእቱ ዓመት። እክለ እኩለ። ወበልዑ ወጸግቡ።

11:22 All who were planting seed came to him in this year, and he kept going with them until the seedtime came to an end. They planted their land and that year brought in enough food. So they ate and were filled.
23
11:23 ወበዓመት አሐዱ ዘሱባዔ ኃምስ መሀረ አብራም ለእለ ይገብሩ ንዋየ አልህምት ለኬነተ ዕፅ ወገብሩ ንዋየ በመልዕልተ ምድር በአንጻረ ድጕር ዕርፍ ከመ ያንብር ላዕሌሁ ዘርአ ወይወርድ እምውስቴቱ ዘርእ ውስተ ከተማ ዕርፍ ወይትኀባእ ውስተ ምድር ወኢይፈርሁ እንከ እምገጸ ቋዓት 

11:23 In the first year of the fifth week [1891] Abram taught the people who made equipment for bulls — the skillful woodworkers — and they made an implement above the ground, opposite the plow beam, so that one could place seed on it. The seed would then drop down from it onto the end of the plow and be hidden in the ground; and they would no longer be afraid of the ravens. 

24
11:24 ወገብሩ ከመዝ ላዕለ ኵሉ ድጕረ ዕርፍ መልዕልተ ምድር ወዘርኡ ወገብሩ ኵሉ ምድር ዘከመ አዘዞሙ አብራም ወኢይፈርሁ እንከ እምአዕዋፍ።

11:24 They made (something) like this above the ground on every plow beam. They planted seed, and all the land did as Abram told them. So they were no longer afraid of the birds.

12:5 Why do you worship those things which have no spirit in them? For they are made by hands and you carry them on your shoulders. You receive no help from them, but instead they are a great shame for those who make them and an error of the mind for those who worship them. Do not worship them’.
