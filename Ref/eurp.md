Θησεύς
φεῦ τῆς βροτείας — ποῖ προβήσεται; — φρενός.
τί τέρμα τόλμης καὶ θράσους γενήσεται;
εἰ γὰρ κατ᾽ ἀνδρὸς βίοτον ἐξογκώσεται,
ὁ δ᾽ ὕστερος τοῦ πρόσθεν εἰς ὑπερβολὴν
940πανοῦργος ἔσται, θεοῖσι προσβαλεῖν χθονὶ
ἄλλην δεήσει γαῖαν, ἣ χωρήσεται
τοὺς μὴ δικαίους καὶ κακοὺς πεφυκότας.
σκέψασθε δ᾽ ἐς τόνδ᾽, ὅστις ἐξ ἐμοῦ γεγὼς
ᾔσχυνε τἀμὰ λέκτρα κἀξελέγχεται
945πρὸς τῆς θανούσης ἐμφανῶς κάκιστος ὤν.
δεῖξον δ᾽, ἐπειδή γ᾽ ἐς μίασμ᾽ ἐλήλυθα,
τὸ σὸν πρόσωπον δεῦρ᾽ ἐναντίον πατρί.
σὺ δὴ θεοῖσιν ὡς περισσὸς ὢν ἀνὴρ
ξύνει; σὺ σώφρων καὶ κακῶν ἀκήρατος;
950οὐκ ἂν πιθοίμην τοῖσι σοῖς κόμποις ἐγὼ
θεοῖσι προσθεὶς ἀμαθίαν φρονεῖν κακῶς.

Theseus
Oh, the heart of mortals, how far will it go? What limit can be set to hardihood and brazenness? If it grows great in the course of a man's life, and the man who comes after shall overtop his predecessor [940] in knavery, the gods will have to add another earth to our world to hold the criminal and the vile!

Look at this man! He was born from my loins, and yet he disgraced my bed and is clearly convicted [945] of utter baseness by the dead woman here.

Hippolytus turns away.
Come, show your face to your father, eye to eye, since in any case I have already involved myself in pollution.1 Are you, then, the companion of the gods, as a man beyond the common? Are you the chaste one, untouched by evil? [950] I will never be persuaded by your vauntings, never be so unintelligent as to impute folly to the gods. 

## 954
ἤδη νυν αὔχει καὶ δι᾽ ἀψύχου βορᾶς
σίτοις καπήλευ᾽ Ὀρφέα τ᾽ ἄνακτ᾽ ἔχων
βάκχευε πολλῶν γραμμάτων τιμῶν καπνούς:
955ἐπεί γ᾽ ἐλήφθης. τοὺς δὲ τοιούτους ἐγὼ
φεύγειν προφωνῶ πᾶσι: θηρεύουσι γὰρ
σεμνοῖς λόγοισιν, αἰσχρὰ μηχανώμενοι.

Continue then your confident boasting, take up a diet of greens and play the showman with your food, make Orpheus your lord and engage in mystic rites, holding the vaporings of many books in honor.2 [955] For you have been found out. To all I give the warning: avoid men like this. For they make you their prey with their high-holy-sounding words while they contrive deeds of shame.

τέθνηκεν ἥδε: τοῦτό σ᾽ ἐκσώσειν δοκεῖς;
ἐν τῷδ᾽ ἁλίσκῃ πλεῖστον, ὦ κάκιστε σύ:
960ποῖοι γὰρ ὅρκοι κρείσσονες, τίνες λόγοι
τῆσδ᾽ ἂν γένοιντ᾽ ἄν, ὥστε σ᾽ αἰτίαν φυγεῖν;
μισεῖν σε φήσεις τήνδε, καὶ τὸ δὴ νόθον
τοῖς γνησίοισι πολέμιον πεφυκέναι:
κακὴν ἄρ᾽ αὐτὴν ἔμπορον βίου λέγεις,
965εἰ δυσμενείᾳ σῇ τὰ φίλτατ᾽ ὤλεσεν.
ἀλλ᾽ ὡς τὸ μῶρον ἀνδράσιν μὲν οὐκ ἔνι,
γυναιξὶ δ᾽ ἐμπέφυκεν; οἶδ᾽ ἐγὼ νέους,
οὐδὲν γυναικῶν ὄντας ἀσφαλεστέρους,
ὅταν ταράξῃ Κύπρις ἡβῶσαν φρένα:
970τὸ δ᾽ ἄρσεν αὐτοὺς ὠφελεῖ προσκείμενον.
νῦν οὖν — τί ταῦτα σοῖς ἁμιλλῶμαι λόγοις
νεκροῦ παρόντος μάρτυρος σαφεστάτου;
ἔξερρε γαίας τῆσδ᾽ ὅσον τάχος φυγάς,
καὶ μήτ᾽ Ἀθήνας τὰς θεοδμήτους μόλῃς
975μήτ᾽ εἰς ὅρους γῆς ἧς ἐμὸν κρατεῖ δόρυ.
εἰ γὰρ παθών γε σοῦ τάδ᾽ ἡσσηθήσομαι,
οὐ μαρτυρήσει μ᾽ Ἴσθμιος Σίνις ποτὲ
κτανεῖν ἑαυτὸν ἀλλὰ κομπάζειν μάτην,
οὐδ᾽ αἱ θαλάσσῃ σύννομοι Σκιρωνίδες
980φήσουσι πέτραι τοῖς κακοῖς μ᾽ εἶναι βαρύν.

She is dead. Do you think this will save you? This is the fact that most serves to convict you, villainous man. [960] For what oaths, what arguments, could be more powerful than she is, to win you acquittal on the charge? Will you claim that she hated you and that the bastard is always regarded as an enemy to the true-born? It is a poor merchant of her own life you make her, then, [965] if she destroyed what was most precious to herself for enmity of you.3 But will you say that folly is not to be found in men but is native to women? I know that young men are no more stable than women when Aphrodite stirs their young hearts to confusion. [970] But their standing as males steads them well.

And so now—but why do I wage this contest against your speech when this corpse, witness most reliable, lies near? Go forth from this land with all speed as an exile, and come no more either to god-built Athens [975] or to the borders of any land ruled by my spear. For if I am to be bested by you when you have done this to me, Isthmian Sinis shall no longer attest that I killed him but say it was an idle boast, and the Skironian rocks near the sea [980] shall deny that I am a scourge to evil-doers.

Chorus Leader
I know not how I might say that any mortal enjoys good fortune. For all that is noblest is now overthrown.
# cret
fragment from Euripides' lost play Cretan Men (Kretes) has the chorus of Cretan men describe the "pure life" they have led since they became initiates (mystai) of Idaean Zeus and celebrants of:

night-ranging Zagreus, performing his feasts of raw flesh; and raising torches high to the mountain Mother among the Curetes,[18]

and were consecrated and received the title of "bacchus".[19] 

This passage associates Zagreus with the cult of Zeus at Cretan Mount Ida, where the infant Zeus was guarded by the Cretan Curetes. According to West, Zagreus here is "a god of nocturnal mystery-rites, associated with a sacramental feast of raw flesh (and thus with the dismemberment of an animal victim)" and infers from this Euripidean passage that Zagreus "played a part in mysteries which claimed a Cretan origin."[20]

ἥκω Διὸς παῖς τήνδε Θηβαίων χθόνα

I, the son of Zeus, have come to this land of the Thebans—Dionysus, whom once Semele, Kadmos' daughter, bore, delivered by a lightning-bearing flame. And having taken a mortal form instead of a god's, [5] I am here at the fountains of Dirke and the water of Ismenus. And I see the tomb of my thunder-stricken mother here near the palace, and the remnants of her house, smouldering with the still living flame of Zeus' fire, the everlasting insult of Hera against my mother. [10] I praise Kadmos, who has made this place hallowed, the shrine of his daughter; and I have covered it all around with the cluster-bearing leaf of the vine.

I have left the wealthy lands of the Lydians and Phrygians, the sun-parched plains of the Persians, [15] and the Bactrian walls, and have passed over the wintry land of the Medes, and blessed Arabia, and all of Asia which lies along the coast of the salt sea with its beautifully-towered cities full of Hellenes and barbarians mingled together; [20] and I have come to this Hellene city first, having already set those other lands to dance and established my mysteries there, so that I might be a deity manifest among men.
