κρόμμυον δὲ οὐκ ἄν τις προσενέγκαιτο τῶν καθιερουμένων τῷ κατὰ Πηλούσιον Κασίῳ Διί, ὥσπερ οὐδὲ ἱερεὺς τῆς κατὰ Λιβύην Ἀφροδίτης σκόρδου γεύσαιτο ἄν. ἀπέχονται δὲ ἐν ‹οἷς› μὲν ἱεροῖς μίνθης, ἐν οἷς δὲ ἡδυόσμου, ἐν οἷς δὲ σελίνου. 

No one would offer an onion as a sacrifice to Zeus of Casium at Pelusium, just as a priest of the Libyan Aphrodite would never taste garlic. In some temples, they abstain from mint, in others from sweet marjoram, and in others from celery.

(Πυῤῥώνειοι ὑποτυπώσεις τοῦ Σέξτου Ἐμπειρικοῦ III 224 (I 193, 32 Hermann Mutschmann):)

ἔνιοι δὲ θάττον ἂν τὰς κεφαλὰς φαγεῖν φασι τῶν πατέρων ἢ κυάμους.

“But some say they would sooner eat the heads of their fathers than (eat) broad beans.”

#### 7.49.100
[ἐν τούτοις δέ εἰσι καὶ οἱ  [49] ἀπὸ τῆς σκέψεως.] ὧν Ξενοφάνης μὲν κατά τινας εἰπὼν πάντα ἀκατάληπτα ἐπὶ ταύτης ἔστη τῆς φορᾶς, ἐν οἷς γράφει 

From this consideration, Xenophanes, according to some, declared everything to be unknowable and adhered to this position. Among his writings, he states: 

καὶ τὸ μὲν οὖν σαφὲς οὔτις ἀνὴρ ἴδεν, οὐδέ τις ἔσται εἰδὼς ἀμφὶ θεῶν τε καὶ ἅσσα λέγω περὶ πάντων· 

"Indeed, no man has seen the clear truth, nor will anyone ever know concerning the gods and all the things I speak of. 

εἰ γὰρ καὶ τὰ μάλιστα τύχοι τετελεσμένον εἰπών, αὐτὸς ὅμως οὐκ οἶδε· 

For even if by chance someone were to utter the complete truth, they themselves would not know it; 

δόκος δ' ἐπὶ πᾶσι τέτυκται. 

opinion has been allotted to all." 
### 7.111
##### 1
[111] ὁ δὲ γνώριμος αὐτοῦ Παρμενίδης τοῦ μὲν δοξαστοῦ λόγου κατέγνω, φημὶ δὲ τοῦ ἀσθενεῖς ἔχοντος ὑπολήψεις, τὸν δ' ἐπιστημονικόν, τουτέστι τὸν ἀδιάπτωτον, ὑπέθετο κριτήριον, ἀποστὰς καὶ ‹αὐτὸς› τῆς τῶν αἰσθήσεων πίστεως. ἐναρχόμενος γοῦν τοῦ Περὶ φύσεως γράφει τοῦτον τὸν τρόπον·

"Parmenides, his acquaintance, rejected the doxastic discourse—that is, the one based on weak opinions—and established the epistemic discourse, meaning the unchanging one, as the criterion, distancing himself from trust in the senses. At the beginning of *On Nature*, he writes as follows:  

ἵπποι ταί με φέρουσιν, ὅσον τ' ἐπὶ θυμὸς ἱκάνοι, πέμπον, ἐπεί μ' ἐς ὁδὸν βῆσαν πολύφημον ἄγουσαι δαίμονος, ἣ κατὰ πάντ' ἄστη φέρει εἰδότα φῶτα· 

'Horses carried me as far as my spirit reached,  
they led me, as they set me upon the widely sung path of the goddess,  
which leads the knowing man through all cities.  

τῇ φερόμην· 

There I was carried—  

τῇ γάρ με πολύφραστοι φέρον ἵπποι ἅρμα τιταίνουσαι, κοῦραι δ' ὁδὸν ἡγεμόνευον.

for the far-famed horses bore me onward,  
stretching the chariot, while maidens guided the way.  

ἄξων δ' ἐν χνοίῃσιν ἵ‹ει› σύριγγος αὐτήν αἰθόμενος (δοιοῖς γὰρ ἐπείγετο δινωτοῖσιν κύκλοις ἀμφοτέρωθεν), ὅτε σπερχοίατο πέμπειν Ἡλιάδες κοῦραι, προλιποῦσαι δώματα Νυκτός, εἰς φάος, ὠσάμεναι κράτων ἄπο χερσὶ καλύπτρας.

The axle, glowing in the sockets, whistled like a pipe,  
(for it was pressed on both sides by spinning wheels),  
as the daughters of the Sun hurried to escort me,  
having left the halls of Night for the light,  
pushing back their veils from their hands.  

ἔνθα πύλαι Νυκτός τε καὶ Ἤματός εἰσι κελεύθων, καί σφας ὑπέρθυρον ἀμφὶς ἔχει καὶ λάινος οὐδός· 

There stand the gates of the paths of Night and Day,  
and a great lintel and stone threshold surround them.  

αὐταὶ δ' αἰθέριαι πλῆνται μεγάλοισι θυρέτροις· 

The gates themselves, filled with aether, are closed with mighty doors,  

τῶν δὲ Δίκη πολύποινος ἔχει κληῖδας ἀμοιβούς.

and Justice, who punishes much, holds their reversible keys.  
##### ?
τὴν δὴ παρφάμεναι κοῦραι μαλακοῖσι λόγοισιν πεῖσαν ἐπιφραδέως, ὥς σφιν βαλανωτὸν ὀχῆα ἀπτερέως ὤσειε πυλέων ἄπο. 

But the maidens, persuading her with soft words,  
cleverly convinced her to push back the bolt swiftly from the gates.  

ταὶ δὲ θυρέτρων χάσμ' ἀχανὲς ποίησαν ἀναπτάμεναι, πολυχάλκους ἄξονας ἐν σύριγξιν ἀμοιβαδὸν εἰλίξασαι, γόμφοις καὶ περόνῃσιν ἀρηρότε· 

And the vast chasm of the doors opened,  
as the hinges, set in sockets,  
turned their bronze-covered axles one by one,  
fastened with pins and bolts.  

τῇ ῥα δι' αὐτέων ἰθὺς ἔχον κοῦραι κατ' ἀμαξιτὸν ἅρμα καὶ ἵππους.

Through them the maidens straightaway led the chariot and horses along the road.  

καί με θεὰ πρόφρων ὑπεδέξατο, χεῖρα δὲ χειρί δεξιτερὴν ἕλεν, ὧδε δ' ἔπος φάτο καί με προσηύδα·

And the goddess received me kindly,  
took my right hand in hers,  
and spoke these words, addressing me:  

ὦ κοῦρ' ἀθανάτοισι συνάορος ἡνιόχοισιν, ἵπποις ταί σε φέρουσιν ἱκάνων ἡμέτερον δῶ, χαῖρ', ἐπεὶ οὔτι σε μοῖρα κακὴ προὔπεμπε νέεσθαι τήνδ' ὁδόν 

“O youth, companion of immortal charioteers,  
who arrive at my house with these horses,  
rejoice, for no evil fate sent you on this path  

(ἦ γὰρ ἀπ' ἀνθρώπων ἐκτὸς πάτου ἐστίν), 

(for it lies far beyond the path of men),  

ἀλλὰ θέμις τε δίκη τε. χρεὼ δέ σε πάντα πυθέσθαι ἠμὲν Ἀληθείης εὐπειθέος ἀτρεμὲς ἦτορ ἠδὲ βροτῶν δόξας, ταῖς οὐκ ἔνι πίστις ἀληθής.

but Right and Justice have guided you.  
You must learn all things—  
both the unshakable truth of Reality  
and the beliefs of mortals, in which there is no true trust.  

ἀλλὰ σὺ τῆσδ' ἀφ' ὁδοῦ διζήσιος εἶργε νόημα, μηδέ σ' ἔθος πολύπειρον ὁδὸν κάτα τήνδε βιάσθω νωμᾶν ἄσκοπον ὄμμα καὶ ἠχήεσσαν ἀκουήν καὶ γλῶσσαν, κρῖναι δὲ λόγῳ πολύπειρον ἔλεγχον ἐξ ἐμέθεν ῥηθέντα. 

But you must keep your mind from this path of searching,  
nor let habit, rich in experience,  
force you along this well-worn road,  
casting about with aimless eyes and echoing ears and tongue,  
but judge by reason the many-proven refutation I will tell you.  

μόνος δ' ἔτι θυμὸς ὁδοῖο λείπεται.

Only one path remains for inquiry.'"

### 9.17
Εὐήμερος δὲ ὁ ἐπικληθεὶς ἄθεός φησιν· "ὅτ' ἦν ἄτακτος ἀνθρώπων βίος, οἱ περιγενόμενοι τῶν ἄλλων ἰσχύι τε καὶ συνέσει ὥστε πρὸς τὰ ὑπ' αὐτῶν κελευόμενα πάντας βιοῦν, σπουδάζοντες μείζονος θαυμασμοῦ καὶ σεμνότητος τυχεῖν, ἀνέπλασαν περὶ αὑτοὺς ὑπερβάλλουσάν τινα καὶ θείαν δύναμιν, ἔνθεν καὶ τοῖς πολλοῖς ἐνομίσθησαν θεοί".

Euhemerus, who was called an atheist, says:
"When human life was disordered, those who excelled others in strength and wisdom organized all to live according to their commands. Striving to achieve greater admiration and reverence, they fabricated for themselves a transcendent and divine power, from which they were considered gods by the masses.
### 9.18
Πρόδικος δὲ ὁ Κεῖος "ἥλιόν" φησι "καὶ σελήνην καὶ ποταμοὺς καὶ κρήνας καὶ καθόλου πάντα τὰ ὠφελοῦντα τὸν βίον ἡμῶν οἱ παλαιοὶ θεοὺς ἐνόμισαν διὰ τὴν ἀπ' αὐτῶν ὠφέλειαν, καθάπερ Αἰγύπτιοι τὸν Νεῖλον"· καὶ διὰ τοῦτο τὸν μὲν ἄρτον Δήμητραν νομισθῆναι, τὸν δὲ οἶνον Διόνυσον, τὸ δὲ ὕδωρ Ποσειδῶνα, τὸ δὲ πῦρ Ἥφαιστον καὶ ἤδη τῶν [19] εὐχρηστούντων ἕκαστον. 

Prodicus of Ceos says:
"The sun, the moon, rivers, springs, and, in general, everything beneficial to our lives were considered gods by the ancients because of the aid they provided, just as the Egyptians regarded the Nile. Thus, bread was considered Demeter, wine was considered Dionysus, water was Poseidon, fire was Hephaestus, and each useful thing was associated with a deity.
### 9.144
Ἔστι δὲ καὶ ἐπὶ μιᾶς αἰσθήσεως ἐξεργαστικώτερον τιθέναι τὸν λόγον, οἷον τῆς ὁράσεως. 

It is also possible to construct an argument based on a single sense, such as vision. 

εἰ γὰρ ἔστι τὸ θεῖον, ζῷόν ἐστιν. εἰ ‹δὲ› ζῷόν ἐστιν, ὁρᾷ [ὅλος]

For if the divine exists, it is a living being. And if it is a living being, it sees [as a whole].

οὖλος γὰρ ὁρᾷ, οὖλος δὲ νοεῖ, οὖλος δέ τ' ἀκούει.

For as a whole it sees, as a whole it thinks, and as a whole it hears.
### 9.193
ἔνθεν καὶ ὁ Ξενοφάνης διελέγχων τοὺς περὶ Ὅμηρον καὶ Ἡσίοδόν φησι· πάντα θεοῖς ἀνέθηκαν Ὅμηρός θ' Ἡσίοδός τε ὅσσα παρ' ἀνθρώποισιν ὀνείδεα καὶ ψόγος ἐστίν, κλέπτειν μοιχεύειν τε καὶ ἀλλήλους ἀπατεύειν.

Hence, Xenophanes, refuting Homer and Hesiod, says:
"Homer and Hesiod attributed to the gods all that is shameful and blameworthy among humans—stealing, committing adultery, and deceiving one another.
