κρόμμυον δὲ οὐκ ἄν τις προσενέγκαιτο τῶν καθιερουμένων τῷ κατὰ Πηλούσιον Κασίῳ Διί, ὥσπερ οὐδὲ ἱερεὺς τῆς κατὰ Λιβύην Ἀφροδίτης σκόρδου γεύσαιτο ἄν. ἀπέχονται δὲ ἐν ‹οἷς› μὲν ἱεροῖς μίνθης, ἐν οἷς δὲ ἡδυόσμου, ἐν οἷς δὲ σελίνου. 

No one would offer an onion as a sacrifice to Zeus of Casium at Pelusium, just as a priest of the Libyan Aphrodite would never taste garlic. In some temples, they abstain from mint, in others from sweet marjoram, and in others from celery.

(Πυῤῥώνειοι ὑποτυπώσεις τοῦ Σέξτου Ἐμπειρικοῦ III 224 (I 193, 32 Hermann Mutschmann):)

ἔνιοι δὲ θάττον ἂν τὰς κεφαλὰς φαγεῖν φασι τῶν πατέρων ἢ κυάμους.

“But some say they would sooner eat the heads of their fathers than (eat) broad beans.”

### 7.49.100
ἀπὸ τῆς σκέψεως.] ὧν Ξενοφάνης μὲν κατά τινας εἰπὼν πάντα ἀκατάληπτα ἐπὶ ταύτης ἔστη τῆς φορᾶς, ἐν οἷς γράφει καὶ τὸ μὲν οὖν σαφὲς οὔτις ἀνὴρ ἴδεν, οὐδέ τις ἔσται εἰδὼς ἀμφὶ θεῶν τε καὶ ἅσσα λέγω περὶ πάντων· εἰ γὰρ καὶ τὰ μάλιστα τύχοι τετελεσμένον εἰπών, αὐτὸς ὅμως οὐκ οἶδε· δόκος δ' ἐπὶ πᾶσι τέτυκται.

From this consideration, Xenophanes, according to some, declared everything to be unknowable and adhered to this position. Among his writings, he states:
"Indeed, no man has seen the clear truth, nor will anyone ever know concerning the gods and all the things I speak of. For even if by chance someone were to utter the complete truth, they themselves would not know it; opinion has been allotted to all."

### 9.17
Εὐήμερος δὲ ὁ ἐπικληθεὶς ἄθεός φησιν· "ὅτ' ἦν ἄτακτος ἀνθρώπων βίος, οἱ περιγενόμενοι τῶν ἄλλων ἰσχύι τε καὶ συνέσει ὥστε πρὸς τὰ ὑπ' αὐτῶν κελευόμενα πάντας βιοῦν, σπουδάζοντες μείζονος θαυμασμοῦ καὶ σεμνότητος τυχεῖν, ἀνέπλασαν περὶ αὑτοὺς ὑπερβάλλουσάν τινα καὶ θείαν δύναμιν, ἔνθεν καὶ τοῖς πολλοῖς ἐνομίσθησαν θεοί".

Euhemerus, who was called an atheist, says:
"When human life was disordered, those who excelled others in strength and wisdom organized all to live according to their commands. Striving to achieve greater admiration and reverence, they fabricated for themselves a transcendent and divine power, from which they were considered gods by the masses.
### 9.18
Πρόδικος δὲ ὁ Κεῖος "ἥλιόν" φησι "καὶ σελήνην καὶ ποταμοὺς καὶ κρήνας καὶ καθόλου πάντα τὰ ὠφελοῦντα τὸν βίον ἡμῶν οἱ παλαιοὶ θεοὺς ἐνόμισαν διὰ τὴν ἀπ' αὐτῶν ὠφέλειαν, καθάπερ Αἰγύπτιοι τὸν Νεῖλον"· καὶ διὰ τοῦτο τὸν μὲν ἄρτον Δήμητραν νομισθῆναι, τὸν δὲ οἶνον Διόνυσον, τὸ δὲ ὕδωρ Ποσειδῶνα, τὸ δὲ πῦρ Ἥφαιστον καὶ ἤδη τῶν [19] εὐχρηστούντων ἕκαστον. 

Prodicus of Ceos says:
"The sun, the moon, rivers, springs, and, in general, everything beneficial to our lives were considered gods by the ancients because of the aid they provided, just as the Egyptians regarded the Nile. Thus, bread was considered Demeter, wine was considered Dionysus, water was Poseidon, fire was Hephaestus, and each useful thing was associated with a deity.
### 9.193
ἔνθεν καὶ ὁ Ξενοφάνης διελέγχων τοὺς περὶ Ὅμηρον καὶ Ἡσίοδόν φησι· πάντα θεοῖς ἀνέθηκαν Ὅμηρός θ' Ἡσίοδός τε ὅσσα παρ' ἀνθρώποισιν ὀνείδεα καὶ ψόγος ἐστίν, κλέπτειν μοιχεύειν τε καὶ ἀλλήλους ἀπατεύειν.

Hence, Xenophanes, refuting Homer and Hesiod, says:
"Homer and Hesiod attributed to the gods all that is shameful and blameworthy among humans—stealing, committing adultery, and deceiving one another.
