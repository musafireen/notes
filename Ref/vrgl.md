ventum erat ad limen, cum virgo 'poscere fata              
tempus' ait; 'deus ecce deus!' cui talia fanti
ante fores subito non vultus, non color unus,
non comptae mansere comae; sed pectus anhelum,
et rabie fera corda tument, maiorque videri

While at the door they paused, the virgin cried :
“Ask now thy doom!—the god! the god is nigh!”
So saying, from her face its color flew,
Her twisted locks flowed free, the heaving breast
Swelled with her heart's wild blood; her stature seemed

Talibus ex adyto dictis Cumaea Sibylla

Thus, from the dark recess, the Sibyl spoke,

horrendas canit ambages antroque remugit,
100obscuris vera involvens: ea frena furenti
concutit, et stimulos sub pectore vertit Apollo.
Ut primum cessit furor et rabida ora quierunt,
incipit Aeneas heros: “Non ulla laborum,
O virgo, nova mi facies inopinave surgit;
105omnia praecepi atque animo mecum ante peregi.
Unum oro: quando hic inferni ianua regis
dicitur, et tenebrosa palus Acheronte refuso,
ire ad conspectum cari genitoris et ora
contingat; doceas iter et sacra ostia pandas.
110Illum ego per flammas et mille sequentia tela
eripui his umeris, medioque ex hoste recepi;
ille meum comitatus iter, maria omnia mecum
atque omnes pelagique minas caelique ferebat,
invalidus, vires ultra sortemque senectae.
115Quin, ut te supplex peterem et tua limina adirem,
idem orans mandata dabat. Gnatique patrisque,
alma, precor, miserere;—potes namque omnia, nec te
nequiquam lucis Hecate praefecit Avernis;—

And the resisting air the thunder broke;
The cave rebellow'd, and the temple shook.
Th' ambiguous god, who rul'd her lab'ring breast,
In these mysterious words his mind express'd;
Some truths reveal'd, in terms involv'd the rest.
At length her fury fell, her foaming ceas'd,
And, ebbing in her soul, the god decreas'd.
Then thus the chief: “No terror to my view,
No frightful face of danger can be new.
Inur'd to suffer, and resolv'd to dare,
The Fates, without my pow'r, shall be without my care.
This let me crave, since near your grove the road
To hell lies open, and the dark abode
Which Acheron surrounds, th' innavigable flood;
Conduct me thro' the regions void of light,
And lead me longing to my father's sight.
For him, a thousand dangers I have sought,
And, rushing where the thickest Grecians fought,
Safe on my back the sacred burthen brought.
He, for my sake, the raging ocean tried,
And wrath of Heav'n, my still auspicious guide,
And bore beyond the strength decrepid age supplied.
Oft, since he breath'd his last, in dead of night
His reverend image stood before my sight;
Enjoin'd to seek, below, his holy shade;
Conducted there by your unerring aid.
But you, if pious minds by pray'rs are won,
Oblige the father, and protect the son.
Yours is the pow'r; nor Proserpine in vain
Has made you priestess of her nightly reign.

si potuit Manes arcessere coniugis Orpheus,
120Threïcia fretus cithara fidibusque canoris,

If Orpheus, arm'd with his enchanting lyre,
The ruthless king with pity could inspire,
And from the shades below redeem his wife;

si fratrem Pollux alterna morte redemit,
itque reditque viam totiens. 

If Pollux, off'ring his alternate life,
Could free his brother, and can daily go
By turns aloft, by turns descend below—/L>

Quid Thesea, magnum
quid memorem Alciden? Et mi genus ab Iove summo.”

Why name I Theseus, or his greater friend,
Who trod the downward path, and upward could ascend?
Not less than theirs from Jove my lineage came;
My mother greater, my descent the same.”

Talibus orabat dictis, arasque tenebat,
125cum sic orsa loqui vates: “Sate sanguine divom,
Tros Anchisiade, facilis descensus Averno;
noctes atque dies patet atri ianua Ditis;
sed revocare gradum superasque evadere ad auras,
hoc opus, hic labor est. Pauci, quos aequus amavit

Then thus replied the prophetess divine:
“O goddess-born of great Anchises' line,
The gates of hell are open night and day;
Smooth the descent, and easy is the way:
