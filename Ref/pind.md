### 92
ὀπιθόμβροτον αὔχημα δόξας
### 93
οἶον ἀποιχομένων ἀνδρῶν δίαιταν μανύει
### 94
καὶ λογίοις καὶ ἀοιδοῖς: οὐ φθίνει Κροίσου φιλόφρων ἀρετά:

The kindly excellence of Croesus does not perish, 
### 95
τὸν δὲ ταύρῳ χαλκέῳ καυτῆρα νηλέα νόον

But he who burned his victims in a bronze bull, with his pitiless mind, 
### 96
ἐχθρὰ Φάλαριν κατέχει παντᾷ φάτις,

[95] Phalaris, is surrounded on all sides by a hateful reputation, 
### 97
οὐδέ νιν φόρμιγγες ὑπωρόφιαι κοινωνίαν
### 98
[190] μαλθακὰν παίδων ὀάροισι δέκονται.

εἷλε δὲ Περγαμίαν, πέφνεν δὲ σὺν κείνῳ Μερόπων
ἔθνεα καὶ τὸν βουβόταν οὔρεϊ ἴσον
Φλέγραισιν εὑρὼν Ἀλκυονῆ, σφετέρας δ᾽ οὐ φείσατο
[50] χερσὶν βαρυφθόγγοιο νευρᾶς
35Ἡρακλέης. 

He took Pergamos, and with Telamon's help he slew the tribes of Meropes, and the herdsman Alcyoneus, huge as a mountain, whom he found at Phlegrae, and he did not keep his hands off the deep-voiced bow-string, not [35] Heracles. 

ἀλλ᾽ Αἰακίδαν καλέων
ἐς πλόον κεῖνον κύρησε δαινυμένων.

But when he came to summon the son of Aeacus to that expedition, he found them feasting. 

τὸν μὲν ἐν ῥινῷ λέοντος στάντα κελήσατο νεκταρέαις σπονδαῖσιν ἄρξαι
καρτεραίχμαν Ἀμφιτρυωνιάδαν,
ἄνδωκε δ᾽ αὐτῷ φέρτατος
40οἰνοδόκον φιάλαν χρυσῷ πεφρικυῖαν Τελαμών,
[60] ὁ δ᾽ ἀνατείναις οὐρανῷ χεῖρας ἀμάχους
αὔδασε τοιοῦτον ἔπος: 

Standing in a lion's skin, the strong warrior, son of Amphitryon, was asked to pour the first libation of nectar by incomparable Telamon, who lifted up to him [40] the wine-bearing goblet bristling with gold. And Heracles stretched his invincible hands up to heaven and said, 

‘εἴ ποτ᾽ ἐμάν, ὦ Ζεῦ πάτερ,
θυμῷ ἐθέλων ἀρὰν ἄκουσας,
νῦν σε, νῦν εὐχαῖς ὑπὸ θεσπεσίαις
45λίσσομαι παῖδα θρασὺν ἐξ Ἐριβοίας
ἀνδρὶ τῷδε, ξεῖνον ἀμὸν μοιρίδιον τελέσαι,

“Father Zeus, if you have ever heard my prayers with a willing heart, now, now with divine prayers [45] I entreat you to grant this man a brave son from Eriboea, a son fated to be my guest-friend. 

τὸν μὲν ἄρρηκτον φυάν, ὥσπερ τόδε δέρμα με νῦν περιπλανᾶται
[70] θηρός, ὃν πάμπρωτον ἄθλων κτεῖνά ποτ᾽ ἐν Νεμέᾳ:
θυμὸς δ᾽ ἑπέσθω.’ 

May he have a body as invulnerable as this skin that is now wrapped around me, from the beast whom I killed that day in Nemea as the very first of my labors.
