KITRA Gâṅgyâyani 1, forsooth, wishing to perform a sacrifice, chose Âruni (Uddâlaka 2, to be his chief priest). But Âruni sent his son, Svetaketu, and said: 'Perform the sacrifice for him.' When Svetaketu 3 had arrived, Kitra asked him: 'Son of Gautama 4, is there a hidden place in the world where you are able to place me, or is it the other way, and are you going to place me in the world to which it (that other way) leads 5?'

p. 272

He answered and said: 'I do not know this. But, let me ask the master.' Having approached his father, he asked: 'Thus has Kitra asked me; how shall I answer?'

p. 273

Âruni said: 'I also do not know this. Only after having learnt the proper portion of the Veda in Kitra's own dwelling, shall we obtain what others give us (knowledge). Come, we will both go.'

Having said this he took fuel in his hand (like a pupil), and approached Kitra Gâṅgyâyani, saying: 'May I come near to you?' He replied: 'You are worthy of Brahman 1, O Gautama, because you were not led away by pride. Come hither, I shall make you know clearly.'

And Kitra said: All who depart from this world (or this body) go to the moon 2. In the former, (the bright) half, the moon delights in their spirits; in the other, (the dark) half, the moon sends them on to be born again 1. Verily, the moon is the door of the Svarga world (the heavenly world). Now, if a man objects to the moon (if one is not satisfied with life there) the moon sets him free 2. But if a man does not object, then the moon sends him down as rain upon this earth. And according to his deeds and according to his knowledge he is born again here as a worm, or as an insect, or as a fish, or as a bird, or as a lion, or as a boar, or as a serpent 3, or as a tiger, or as a man, or as something else in different places 4. When he has thus returned to the earth, some one (a sage) asks: 'Who art thou?' And he should answer: 'From the wise moon, who orders the seasons 5, when it is born consisting of fifteen parts, from the moon who is the home of our ancestors, the seed was brought. This seed, even me, they (the gods mentioned in the Pañkâgnividyâ 6) gathered up in an active man, and through an active man they brought me to a mother. Then I, growing up to be born, a being living by months, whether twelve or thirteen, was together with my father, who also lived by (years of) twelve or thirteen months, that I might either know it (the true Brahman) or not know it. Therefore, O ye seasons 1, grant that I may attain immortality (knowledge of Brahman). By this my true saying, by this my toil (beginning with the dwelling in the moon and ending with my birth on earth) I am (like) a season, and the child of the seasons.' 'Who art thou?' the sage asks again. 'I am thou,' he replies. Then he sets him free 2 (to proceed onward).

He (at the time of death), having reached the path of the gods, comes to the world of Agni (fire), to the world of Vâyu (air), to the world of Varuna, to the world of Indra, to the world of Pragâpati (Virâg), to the world of Brahman (Hiranyagarbha). In that world there is the lake Âra 3, the moments called Yeshtiha 4, the river Vigarâ (age-less), the tree Ilya 5, the city Sâlagya, the palace Aparâgita (unconquerable), the door-keepers Indra and Pragâpati, the hall of Brahman, called Vibhu 1 (built by vibhu, egoism), the throne Vikakshanâ (buddhi, perception), the couch Amitaugas (endless splendour), and the beloved Mânasî (mind) and her image Kâkshushî (eye), who, as if taking flowers, are weaving the worlds, and the Apsaras, the Ambâs (sruti, sacred scriptures), and Ambâyavîs (buddhi, understanding), and the rivers Ambayâs (leading to the knowledge of Brahman). To this world he who knows this (who knows the Paryaṅka-vidyâ) approaches. Brahman says to him: 'Run towards him (servants) with such worship as is due to myself. He has reached the river Vigarâ (age-less), he will never age.

Then five hundred Apsaras go towards him, one hundred with garlands in their hands, one hundred with ointments in their hands, one hundred with perfumes in their hands, one hundred with garments in their hands, one hundred with fruit 2 in their hands. They adorn him with an adornment worthy of Brahman, and when thus adorned with the adornment of Brahman, the knower of Brahman moves towards Brahman (neut.) 3 He comes to the lake Âra, and he crosses it by the mind, while those who come to it without knowing the truth 4, are drowned. He comes to the moments called Yeshtiha, they flee from him.

p. 277

He comes to the river Vigarâ, and crosses it by the mind alone, and there shakes off his good and evil deeds. His beloved relatives obtain the good, his unbeloved relatives the evil he has done. And as a man, driving in a chariot, might look at the two wheels (without being touched by them), thus he will look at day and night, thus at good and evil deeds, and at all pairs (at all correlative things, such as light and darkness, heat and cold, &c.) Being freed from good and freed from evil he, the knower of Brahman (neut.), moves towards Brahman.

He approaches the tree Ilya, and the odour of Brahman reaches him. He approaches the city Sâlagya, and the flavour of Brahman reaches him. He approaches the palace Aparâgita, and the splendour of Brahman reaches him. He approaches the door-keepers Indra and Pragâpati, and they run away from him. He approaches the hall Vibhu, and the glory of Brahman reaches him (he thinks, I am Brahman). He approaches the throne Vikakshanâ. The Sâman verses, Brihad and Rathantara, are the eastern feet of that throne 1; the Sâman verses, Syaita and Naudhasa, its western feet; the Sâman verses, Vairûpa and Vairâga, its sides lengthways (south and north); the Sâman verses, Sâkvara and Raivata, its sides crossways (east and west). That throne is Pragñâ, knowledge, for by knowledge (self-knowledge) he sees clearly. He approaches the couch Amitaugas. That is Prâna (speech). The past and the future are its eastern feet; prosperity and earth its western feet; the Sâman verses, Brihad and Rathantara, are the two sides lengthways of the couch (south and north);

p. 278

the Sâman verses, Bhadra and Yagñâyagñîya, are its cross-sides at the head and feet (east and west); the Rik and Sâman are the long sheets 1 (east and west); the Yagus the cross-sheets (south and north); the moon-beam the cushion; the Udgîtha the (white) coverlet; prosperity the pillow 2. On this couch sits Brahman, and he who knows this (who knows himself one with Brahman sitting on the couch) mounts it first with one foot only. Then Brahman says to him: 'Who art thou?' and he shall answer:

'I am (like) a season, and the child of the seasons, sprung from the womb of endless space, from the light (from the luminous Brahman). The light, the origin of the year, which is the past, which is the present, which is all living things, and all elements, is the Self 3. Thou art the Self. What thou art, that am U

Brahman says to him: 'Who am I?' He shall answer: 'That which is, the true' (Sat-tyam).

Brahman asks: 'What is the true?' He says to him: 'What is different from the gods and from the senses (prâna) that is Sat, but the gods and the

p. 279

senses are Tyam. Therefore by that name Sattya (true) is called all this whatever there is. All this thou art.'

This is also declared by a verse: 'This great Rishi, whose belly is the Yagus, the head the Sâman, the form the Rik, is to be known as being imperishable, as being Brahman.'

Brahman says to him: 'How dost thou obtain my male names?' He should answer: 'By breath (prânah).'

Brahman asks: 'How my female names?' He should answer: 'By speech (vâk).'

Brahman asks: 'How my neuter names?' He should answer: 'By mind (manas).'

'How smells?' 'By the nose.' 'How forms?' 'By the eye.' 'How sounds?' 'By the ear.' 'How flavours of food?' 'By the tongue.' 'How actions?' 'By the hands.' 'How pleasures and pain?' 'By the body.' 'How joy, delight, and offspring?' 'By the organ.' 'How journeyings?' 'By the feet.' 'How thoughts, and what is to be known and desired?' 'By knowledge (pragñâ) alone.'

Brahman says to him: 'Water indeed is this my world 1, the whole Brahman world, and it is thine.'

Whatever victory, whatever might belongs to Brahman, that victory and that might he obtains who knows this, yea, who knows this 2.

Prana

अथातो दैवः परिमर 

Next follows the Daiva Parimara 4, the dying around of the gods 

(the absorption of the two classes of gods, mentioned before, into prâna or Brahman). 

एतद्वै ब्रह्म दीप्यते यदग्निर्ज्वलत्यथैतन्म्रियते

This Brahman shines forth indeed when the fire burns, and it dies when it burns not. 

यन्न ज्वलति तस्यादित्यमेव तेजो गच्छति वायुं प्राण एतद्वै

Its splendour goes to the sun alone, the life (prâna, the moving principle) to the air.

ब्रह्म दीप्यते यथादित्यो दृश्यतेऽथैतन्म्रियते यन्न दृश्यते 

This Brahman shines forth indeed when the sun is seen, and it dies when it is not seen. 

तस्य चन्द्रमसमेव तेजो गच्छति वायुं प्राण एतद्वै ब्रह्म दीप्यते 

Its splendour goes to the moon alone, the life (prâna) to the air.

यच्चन्द्रमा दृश्यतेऽथैतन्म्रियते यन्न दृश्यते 

This Brahman shines forth indeed when the moon is seen, and it dies when it is not seen. 

तस्य विद्युतमेव तेजो गच्छति वायुं प्राण 

Its splendour goes to the lightning alone, its life (prâna) to the air.

एतद्वै ब्रह्म दीप्यते यद्विद्युद्विद्योततेऽथैतन्म्रियते यन्न विद्योतते 

This Brahman shines forth indeed when the lightning flashes, and it dies when it flashes not. 

तस्य वायुमेव तेजो गच्छति वायुं प्राणस्ता वा एताः सर्वा देवता 

Its splendour goes to the air, and the life (prâna) to the air. Thus all these deities (i. e. fire, sun, moon, lightning), 

वायुमेव प्रविश्य वायौ सृप्ता न मूर्च्छन्ते

having entered the air, though dead, do not vanish; 

तस्मादेव पुनरुदीरत 

and out of the very air they rise again. 

इत्यधिदैवतमथाध्यात्मम् 

So much with reference to the deities (mythological). Now then with reference to the body (physiological).

Pratardana, forsooth, the son of Divodâsa (king of Kâsî), came by means of fighting and strength to the beloved abode of Indra. Indra said to him 'Pratardana, let me give you a boon to choose.' And Pratardana answered: 'Do you yourself choose that boon for me which you deem most beneficial for a man.' Indra said to him: 'No one who chooses, chooses for another; choose thyself,' Then Pratardana replied: 'Then that boon to choose is no boon for me.'

Then, however, Indra did not swerve from the truth, for Indra is truth. Indra said to him: 'Know me only; that is what I deem most beneficial for man, that he should know me. I slew the three-headed son of Tvashtri; I delivered the Arunmukhas, the devotees, to the wolves (sâlâvrika); breaking many treaties, I killed the people of Prahlâda in heaven, the people of Puloma in the sky, the people of Kâlakañga on earth 2. And not one hair of me was harmed there. And he who knows me thus, by no deed of his is his life harmed, not by the murder of

Indra said: 'I am prâna, meditate on me as the conscious self (pragñâtman), as life, as immortality. Life is prâna, prâna is life. Immortality is prâna, prâna is immortality. As long as prâna dwells in this body, so long surely there is life. By prâna he obtains immortality in the other world, by knowledge true conception. He who meditates on me as life and immortality, gains his full life in this world, and obtains in the Svarga world immortality and indestructibility.'

(Pratardana said): 'Some maintain here, that the prânas become one, for (otherwise) no one could at the same time make known a name by speech, see a form with the eye, hear a sound with the car, think a thought with the mind. After having become one, the prânas perceive all these together, one by one. While speech speaks, all prânas speak after it. While the eye sees, all prânas see after it. While the car hears, all prânas hear after it. While the mind thinks, all prânas think after it. While the prâna breathes, all prânas breathe after it.'

'Thus it is indeed,' said Indra, 'but nevertheless there is a pre-eminence among the prânas 2.

Man lives deprived of speech, for we see dumb people. Man lives deprived of sight, for we see blind people. Man lives deprived of hearing, for we see deaf people. Man lives deprived of mind, for we see infants. Man lives deprived of his arms, deprived of his legs, for we see it thus. But prâna alone is the conscious self (pragñâtman), and having laid hold of this body, it makes it rise up. Therefore it is said, Let man worship it alone as uktha 1. What is prâna, that is pragñâ (self-consciousness); what is pragñâ (self-consciousness), that is prâna, for together they (pragñâ and prâna) live in this body, and together they go out of it. Of that, this is the evidence, this is the understanding. When a man, being thus asleep, sees no dream whatever, he becomes one with that prâna alone 2. Then speech goes to him (when he is absorbed in prâna) with all names, the eye with all forms, the ear with all sounds, the mind with all thoughts. And when he awakes, then, as from a burning fire sparks proceed in all directions, thus from that self the prânâs (speech, &c.) proceed, each towards its place; from the prânas the gods (Agni, &c.), from the gods the worlds.

Of this, this is the proof, this is the understanding. When a man is thus sick, going to die, falling into weakness and faintness, they say: 'His thought has departed, he hears not, he sees not, he speaks not, he thinks not.' Then he becomes one with that prâna alone. Then speech goes to him (who is absorbed in prâna) with all names, the eye with all forms, the ear with all sounds, the mind with all thoughts. And when he departs from this body, he departs together with all these 1.

These ten objects (what is spoken, smelled, seen, &c.) have reference to pragñâ (self-consciousness), the ten subjects (speech, the senses, mind) have reference to objects. If there were no objects, there would be no subjects; and if there were no subjects, there would be no objects. For on either side alone nothing could be achieved. But that (the self of pragñâ, consciousness, and prâna, life) is not many, (but one.) For as in a car the circumference of a wheel is placed on the spokes, and the spokes on the nave, thus are these objects (circumference) placed on the subjects (spokes), and the subjects on the prâna. And that prâna (breath, the living and breathing power) indeed is the self of pragñâ (the self-conscious self), blessed, imperishable, immortal. He does not increase by a good action, nor decrease by a bad action. For he (the self of prâna and pragñâ) makes him, whom he wishes to lead up from these worlds, do a good deed; and the same makes him, whom he wishes to lead down from these worlds, do a bad deed 1. And he is the guardian of the world, he is the king of the world, he is the lord of the universe,--and he is my (Indra's) self, thus let it be known, yea, thus let it be known!

स होवाच बालाकिर्य एवैष आदित्ये पुरुषस्तमेवाहमुपास इति

Bālākī said:
"This very person (Puruṣa) in the sun is the one I meditate upon."

तं होवाचाजातशत्रुर्मामैतस्मिन्समवादयिष्ठा बृहत्पाण्डरवासा अतिष्ठाः सर्वेषां भूतानां मूर्धेति वा अहमेतमुपास इति 

Then Ajātaśatru replied:
"Do not speak to me in this way. The great one, wearing a white robe, stands above all beings as their head. That is the one I meditate upon."

स यो हैतमेवमुपास्तेऽतिष्ठाः  सर्वेषां भूतानां मूर्धा भवति ॥ २॥

Whoever meditates in this way also becomes the head of all beings.

सहोवाच बालाकिर्य एवैष विद्युति पुरुष एतमेवाहं ब्रह्मोपास इति 

Bâlâki said: 'The person that is in the lightning, on him I meditate.'

तं होवाचाजातशत्रुर्मा मैतस्मिन्समवादयिष्ठास्तेजस्यात्मेति वा अहमेतमुपास इति स यो हैतमेवमुपास्ते तेजस्यात्मा भवति ॥ ४॥ 

Agâtasatru said to him: 'Do not challenge me on this. I meditate on him as the self in light. Whoso meditates on him thus, becomes the self in light.'
