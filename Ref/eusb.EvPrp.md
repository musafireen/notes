Καὶ αὐτοῦ δὲ τοῦ Πυθαγορικοῦ φιλοσόφου,

b

τοῦ Νουμηνίου λέγω , ἀπὸ τοῦ πρώτου Περὶ τἀγαθοῦ τάδε παραθήσομαι

ALSO from the Pythagorean philosopher himself, I mean Numenius, I will quote as follows from his first book On the Good:

“ Εἰς δὲ τοῦτο δεήσει εἰπόντα καὶ σημηνάμενον

c
ταῖς μαρτυρίαις ταῖς Πλάτωνος ἀναχωρήσασθαι καὶ ξυνδήσασθαι τοῖς λόγοις τοῦ Πυθαγόρου , ἐρικαλἐσασθαι
δὲ τὰ ἔθνη τὰ εὐδοκιμοῦντα, προσφερόμενον αὐτῶν τὰς τελετὰς καὶ τὰ δόγματα, τάς τε ἱδρύσεις συντελουμένας Πλάτωνι ὁμολογουμένως, ὁπόσας Βσαχμᾶνες καὶ Ἰουδαῖοι καὶ Μάγοι καὶ Αἰγύπτιοι διέ- θεντο

[NUMENIUS] 8 'But when one has spoken upon this point, and sealed it by the testimonies of Plato, it will be necessary to go back and connect it with the precepts of Pythagoras, and to appeal to the nations of good repute, bringing forward their rites and doctrines, and their institutions which are formed in agreement with those of Plato, all that the Brachmans, and Jews, and Magi, and Egyptians arranged.'

Ταῦτα μὲν οὖν περὶ τῶνδε.

So much then on these points.

## c8

Καὶ ἐν τῇ τρίτῃ δὲ βίβλῳ Μώσεως ὁ αὐτὸς

d
τάδε λέγων μνημονεύει

ALSO in his third book the same author makes mention of Moses, speaking as follows: 9

“Τὰ δ’ ἐξῆς Ἰαννῆς καὶ Ἰαμβρῆς Αἰγύπτιοι ἱερογραμματεῖς, ἄνδρες οὐδενὸς ἥττους μαγεῦσαι κριθέντες
εἶναι, ἐπὶ Ἰουδαίων ἐξελαυνομένων ἐξ Αἰγύπτου.

'And next in order came Jannes and Jambres, Egyptian sacred scribes, men judged to have no superiors in the practice of magic, at the time when the Jews were being driven out of Egypt.

2
Μουσαίῳ γοῦν τῷ Ἰουδαίων ἐξηγησαμένῳ, ἀνδρὶ γενομένῳ θεῷ εὔξασθαι δυνατωτάτῳ, οἱ παραστῆναι ἀξιωθέντες ὑπὸ τοῦ πλήθους τοῦ τῶν Αἰγυ ττίων οὗτοι ἦσαν, τῶν τε συμφορῶν ἃς ὁ Μουσαῖος
ἐπῆγε τῇ Αἰγύπτῳ, τὰς νεανικωτάτας αὐτῶν ἐπιλύεσθαι ὤφθησαν δυνατοί.’

'So then these were the men chosen by the people of Egypt as fit to stand beside Musaeus, who led forth the Jews, a man who was most powerful in prayer to God; and of the plagues which Musaeus brought upon Egypt, these men showed themselves able to disperse the most violent.'

3
Διὰ δὴ τούτων ὁ Νουμήνιος καὶ τοῖς ὑπὸ

412
Μώσεως ἐπιIελ͂ῖ-σθ̀εῖσι παραδόξοις θαύμασι καὶ αὐτῷ δὲ ὡς θεοφιλεῖ γενομένῳ μαρτυρεῖ.

Now by these words Numenius bears witness both to the marvellous wonders performed by Moses, and to Moses himself as having been beloved of God.

Συνᾴδει δὲ τούτοις καὶ ὁ Πολυΐστωρ Ἀλέξανδρος, ὢν καὶ πολυμαθὴς ἀνὴρ , τοῖς τε

245
Ἔλλησι γνωριμώτατος, ὃς ἐν τῇ Περὶ Ἰουδαίων συντάξει τὰ κατὰ τὸν Ἀβραὰμ τοῦτον ἱστορεῖ κατὰ λέξιν τον τρόπον

AND with this agrees also Alexander Polyhistor, a man of great intellect and much learning, and very well known to those Greeks who have gathered the fruits of education in no perfunctory manner: for in his compilation, Concerning the Jews, he records the history of this man Abraham in the following manner word for word:

2
“ Εὐπόλεμος δὲ έν τῷ περὶ Ἰουδαίων τῆς Ἀδσυρίας
συρίας φησὶ πόλιν Βαβυλῶνα πρῶτον μὲν κτισθῆναι ὑπὸ τῶν διασωθέντων ἐκ τοῦ κατακλυσμοῦ· εἶναι

v.1.p.485
δὲ αὐτοὺς γίγαντας, οἰκοδομεῖν δὲ τὸν ἱστορούμενον πύργον.

[ALEXANDER POLYHISTOR] 21 'Eupolemus in his book Concerning the Jews of Assyria says that the city Babylon was first founded by those who escaped from the Deluge; and that they were giants, and built the tower renowned in history.

3
πεσόντος δὲ τούτου ὑπὸ τῆς τοῦ θεοῦ ἐνεργείας τοὺς γίγαντας διασπαρῆναι καθ’ ὅλην τὴν

d
γῆν. δεκάτῃ δὲ γενεᾷ, φησὶν, ἐν πόλει τῆς Βαβυλωνίας

ὁρμήσαντα εὐαρεστῆσαι τῷ θεῷ.

'But when this had been overthrown by the act of God, the giants were dispersed over the whole earth. And in the tenth generation, he says, in Camarina a city of Babylonia, which some call the city Uria (and which is by interpretation the city of the Chaldees), + in the thirteenth generation + Abraham was born, who surpassed all men in nobility and wisdom, who was also the inventor of astronomy and the Chaldaic art, and pleased God well by his zeal towards religion.

4
τοῦτον δὲ διὰ τὰ προστάγματα τοῦ θεοῦ εἰς Φοινίκην ἐλθόντα κα- τοικῆσαι, καὶ τροπὰς ἡλίου καὶ σελήνης καὶ τὰ ἄλλα πάντα διδάξαντα τοὺς Φοίνικας εὐαρεστῆσαι τῷ Βασιλεῖ αὐτῶν. ὕστερον δὲ Ἀρμενίους ἐπιστρατεῦσαι

419
βοηθήσαντα ἐγκρατῆ γενέσθαι τῶν αἰχμαλωτισαμένων, καὶ τῶν πολεμίων αἰχμαλωτίσαι τέκνα καὶ γυναῖκας.

'By reason of God's commands this man came and dwelt in Phoenicia, and pleased their king by teaching the Phoenicians the changes of the sun and moon and all things of that kind. And afterwards the Armenians invaded the Phoenicians; and when they had been victorious, and had taken his nephew prisoner, Abraham came to the rescue with his servants, and prevailed over the captors, and made prisoners of the wives and children of the enemy.

5
πρέσβεων δὲ παραγενομένων πρὸς αὐτὸν
ὄπως χρήματα λαβὼν ἀπολυτρώσῃ ταῦτα, μὴ προελέσθαι τοῖς δυστυχοῦσιν ἐπεμβαίνειν , ἀλλὰ τὰς τροφὰς λαβόντα τῶν νεανίσκων ἀποδοῦναι τὰ αἰχμά- λωτα, ξενισθῆναί τε αὐτὸν ὑπὸ πόλεως ἱερὸν Αρυαριξὶν, ὃ εἶναι μεθερμηνευόμενον ὄρος ὑψίστου ·

'And when there came to him ambassadors asking that he would ransom them for money, he did not choose to trample upon the unfortunate, but on receiving food for his young men restored the booty; he was also admitted as a guest into the temple of the city called Argarizin, which being interpreted is "Mount of the Most High," and received gifts from Melchizedek, who was the king, and the priest of God.

6

'But when there came a famine Abraham removed into Egypt with all his household, and dwelt there, and the king of Egypt took his wife in marriage, Abraham having said that she was his sister.

δ’ ἱστόρησεν ὅτι οὐκ ἠδύνατο αὐτῇ συγγενέσθαι, καὶ ὅτι συνέβη φθείρεσθαι αὐτοῦ τὸν λαὸν καὶ τὸν οἶκον. μάντεις δὲ αὐτοῦ καλέσαντος τοῦτο

c
τῶν Αἰγυπτίων οὕτως ἐπιγνῶναι ὅτι γυνὴ ἦν τοῦ Ἀβραὰμ, καὶ ἀποδοῦναι αὐτὴν τῷ ἀνδρί.

'He also related fully that the king was unable to consort with her, and that it came to pass that his people and his household were perishing. And when he had called for the soothsayers, they said that the woman was not a widow; and thus the king of Egypt learned that she was Abraham's wife, and gave her back to her husband.

8
συζή- σαντα δὲ τὸν Ἀβραὰμ ἐν Ἡλιουπόλει τοῖς Αἰγυπτίων ἱερεῦσι πολλὰ μεταδιδάξαι αὐτοὺς, καὶ τὴν ἀστρολογίαν

'And Abraham dwelt with the Egyptian priests in Heliopolis and taught them many things; and it was he who introduced astronomy and the other sciences to them, saying that the Babylonians and himself had found these things out, but tracing back the first discovery to Enoch, and saying that he, and not the Egyptians, had first invented astrology.

9
Βαβυλωνίους γὰρ λέγειν πρῶτον γε-

'For the Babylonians say that the first man was Belus, who is Kronos; and that of him was born a son Belus, and Chanaan; and that this Chanaan begat the father of the Phoenicians, and that his son was Churn, who is called by the Greeks Asbolus, and is father of the Aethiopians, and a brother of Mestraim the father of the Egyptians. But the Greeks say that Atlas invented astrology, and that Atlas is the same as Enoch: and that Enoch had a son Methuselah, who learned all things through angels of God, and thus we gained our knowledge.'

## c27
“ Ἀρτάπανος δέ φησιν ἐν τῇ περὶ Ἰουδαίων, Ἀβραὰμ τελευτήσαντος καὶ τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ Μεμψασθενὼθ , ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ τοῦ βασιλέως τῶν
Αἰγυπτίων, τὴν δυναστείαν παραλαβεῖν τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ Παλμανώθην.

'AND Artapanus says, in his book Concerning the Jews, that after the death of Abraham, and of his son Mempsasthenoth, and likewise of the king of Egypt, his son Palmanothes succeeded to the sovereignty.

2
τοῦτον δὲ τοῖς Ἰουδαίοις

v.1.p.499

'This king behaved badly to the Jews; and first he built Kessa, and founded the temple therein, and then built the temple in Heliopolis.

3
τοῦ-

432
’τον δὲ γεννῆσαι θυγατέρα Μέρριν, ἣν Χενεφρῇ τινι

'He begat a daughter Merris, whom he betrothed to a certain Chenephres, king of the regions above Memphis (for there were at that time many kings in Egypt); and she being barren took a supposititious child from one of the Jews, and called him Mouses (Moses): but by the Greeks he was called, when grown to manhood, Musaeus.

4
γενέσθαι δὲ τὸν Μώϋσον τοῦτον Ὀρφέως διδάσκαλον· ἀνδρωθέντα δ’ αὐτὸν πολλὰ τοῖς ἀνθρώποις εὔχρηστα παραδοῦναι. καὶ γὰρ πλοῖα καὶ μηχανὰς πρὸς τὰς λιθοθεσίας, καὶ τὰ Αἰγυπτία

'And this Moses, they said, was the teacher of Orpheus; and when grown up he taught mankind many useful things. For he was the inventor of ships, and machines for laying stones, and Egyptian arms, and engines for drawing water and for war, and invented philosophy. Further he divided the State into thirty-six Nomes, and. appointed the god to be worshipped by each Nome, and the sacred writing for the priests, and their gods were cats, and dogs, and ibises: he also apportioned an especial district for the priests.

5
ταῦτα δὲ πάντα ποιῆσαι χάριν τοῦ τὴν μοναρχίαν βεβαίαν τῷ Χενεφρῇ διαφυλάξαι. πρότερον γὰρ ἀδιατάκτους ὄντας τοὺς ὄχλους ποτὲ μὲν ἐκβάλλειν,

c
ποτὲ δὲ καθιστάνειν βασιλεῖς, καὶ πολλάκις μὲν τοὺς αὐτοὺς, ἐνιάκις δὲ ἄλλους.

'All these things he did for the sake of keeping the sovereignty firm and safe for Chenepbres. For previously the multitudes, being under no order, now expelled and now set up kings, often the same persons, but sometimes others.

6
διὰ ταῦτα οὖν τὸν Μώϋσον
ὑπὸ τῶν ὄχλων ἀγαπηθῆναι, καὶ ὑπὸ τῶν ἱερέων ἰσοθέου τιμῆς καταξιωθέντα προσαγορευθῆναι Ἑρμῆν, διὰ τὴν τῶν ἱερῶν γραμμάτων ἑρμηνείαν.

'For these reasons then Moses was beloved by the multitudes, and being deemed by the priests worthy to be honoured like a god, was named Hermes, because of his interpretation of the Hieroglyphics.

7
τὸν δὲ Χενεφρῆν ὁρῶντα τὴν ἀρετὴν τοῦ Μωΰσου φθονῆσαι αὐτῷ, καὶ ζητεῖν αὐτὸν ἐπ’ εὐλόγῳ αἰτίᾳ τινὶ ἀνελεῖν.

'But when Chenephres perceived the excellence of Moses he envied him, and sought to slay him on some plausible pretext. And so when the Aethiopians invaded Egypt, Chenephres supposed that he had found a convenient opportunity, and sent Moses in command of a force against them, and enrolled the body of husbandmen for him, supposing that through the weakness of his troops he would easily be destroyed by the enemy.

8
τὸν δὲ Μώϋσον ἐλθόντα ἐπὶ τὸν ‘Eρμοπολίτην ὀνομαζόμενον νομὸν, ἔχοντα
περὶ δέκα μυριάδας γεωργῶν, αὐτοῦ καταστρατοπεδεῦσαι· πέμψαι δὲ στρατηγοὺς τοὺς προκαθεδουμένους τῆς χώρας, οὓς δὴ πλεοκεκτεῖν ἐπιφανῶς κατὰ τὰς μάχας · λέγειν δέ φησιν Ἡλιουπολίτας τὸν πόλεμον τοῦτον ἔτη δέκα.

'But Moses with about a hundred thousand of the husbandmen came to the so-called Nome of Hermopolis, and there encamped; and sent generals to pre-occupy the country, who gained remarkable successes in their battles. He adds that the people of Heliopolis say that this war went on for ten years.

9
τοὺς οὑν
περὶ τὸν Μώϋσον διὰ τὸ μέγεθος τῆς στρατιᾶς πόλιν ἐν τούτῳ κτίσαι τῷ τόπῳ καὶ τὴν ἶβιν ἐν αὐτῇ καθιερῶσαι, διὰ τὸ ταύτην τὰ βλάπτοντα ζῷα τοὺς ἀνθρώπους ἀναιρεῖν. προσαγορεῦσαι δὲ αὐτὴν Ἑρμου

433
πόλιν.

'So Moses, because of the greatness of his army, built a city in this place, and therein consecrated the ibis, because this bird kills the animals that are noxious to man. And he called it Hermes' city.

10
οὕτω δὴ τοὺς Αἰθίοπας , καίπερ
ὄντας πολεμίους , στέρξαι τὸν Μώϋσον ὥστε καὶ τὴν περιτομὴν τῶν αἰδοίων παρ’ ἐκείνου μαθεῖν· οὐ μόνον δὲ τούτους, ἀλλὰ καὶ τοὺς ἱερεῖς ἅπαντας.

'Thus then the Aethiopians, though they were enemies, became so fond of Moses, that they even learned from him the custom of circumcision: and not they only, but also all the priests.

11
τὸν δὲ Χενεφρῆν , λυθέντος τοῦ πολέμου, λόγῳ μὲν αὐτὸν ἀποδέξασθαι, ἔργῳ δὲ ἐπιβουλεύειν. παρελόμενον

'But when the war was ended, Chenephres pretended to welcome him, while in reality continuing to plot against him. So he took his troops from him, and sent some to the frontiers of Aethiopia for an advanced guard; and ordered others to demolish the temple in Diospolis which had been built of baked brick, and build another of stone from the quarries of the neighbouring mountain, and appointed Nacheros superintendent of the building.

12
τὸν δὲ ἐλθόντα μετὰ Μωΰσου εἰς Μέμφιν πυθέσθαι παρ’ αὐτοῦ εἴ τι ἄλλο ἐστὶν εὔχρηστον τοῖς ἀνθρώποις· τὸν δὲ φάναι γένος τῶν βοῶν, διὰ τὸ τὴν γῆν ὑπὸ τούτων ἀροῦσθαι· τὸν δὲ Χενεφρῆν, προσαγορεὐσαντα

v.1.p.501
ὑπὸ τοῦ Μωΰσου κελεύειν ἐκεῖ φέροντας θάπτειν, κατακρύπτειν θέλοντα τὰ τοῦ Μωΰσου ἐπινοήματα.

'And when he was come with Moses to Memphis, he asked him whether there was anything else useful for mankind, and he said the breed of oxen, because by means of them the land is ploughed: and Chenephres having given the name Apis to a bull, commanded the troops to found a temple for him, and bade them bring and bury there the animals which had been consecrated by Moses, because he wished to bury the inventions of Moses in oblivion. 

13
ἀποξενωσάντων δὲ αὐτὸν τῶν Αἰγυπτίων ὁρκω-

c
μοτῆσαι τοὺς φίλους μὴ ἐξαγγεῖλαι τῷ Μωΰσῳ τὴν
ἐπισυνισταμένην αὐτῷ ἐπιβουλὴν καὶ προβαλέσθαι τοὺς ἀναιρήσοντας αὐτόν.

'But when the Egyptians were alienated from him, he bound his friends by an oath not to report to Moses the plot which was being contrived against him, and he appointed the men who were to kill him.

14
μηδενὸς δ ὑπακούσαντος ὀνειδίσαι τὸν Χενεφρῆν Χανεθώθην, τὸν μάλιστα προσαγορευόμενον ὑπ αὐτοῦ· τὸν δὲ ὀνειδισθέντα ὑποσχέσθαι τὴν ἐπίθεσιν, λαβόντα καιρόν.

'When however no one would obey him, Chenephres reproached Chanethothes, whom he had especially addressed; and he, on being thus reproached, promised to make the attempt when he found an opportunity.


15
ὑπὸ δὲ τοῦτον τὸν καιρὸν τῆς Μέρριδος τελευτησάσης ὑποσχέσθαι τὸν Χενεφρὴν τῷ τε Μωΰσῳ καὶ τῷ Χανεθώθῃ τὸ σῶμα διακομίσαντας εἰς τοὺς ὑπὲρ Αἴγυπτον τόπους θάψαι, ὑπολαβόντα τὸν Μώ-

d
ϋσον ὑπὸ τοῦ Χανεθὼθ ἀναιρεθήσεσθαι.

'And Merris having died about this time, Chenephres professed to give the body to Moses and Chanethothes to carry it over into regions beyond Egypt and bury it, supposing that Moses would be slain by Chanethothes.

16
πορευομένων
δὲ αὐτῶν τὴν ἐπιβουλὴν τῷ Μωΰσῳ τῶν συνειδότων ἐξαγγεῖλαί τινα· τὸν δὲ φυλάσσοντα αὐτὸν τὴν μὲν Μέρριν θάψαι, τὸν δὲ ποταμὸν καὶ τὴν ἐν ἐκείνῳ πόλιν Μερόην προσαγορεῦσαι. τιμᾶσθαι δὲ τὴν Μέρριν ταύτην ὑπὸ τῶν ἐγχωρίων οὐκ
ἔλαττον ἢ τὴν Ἶσιν.

'But while they were on the way, one of those who were cognizant of the plot reported it to Moses; and he being on his guard buried Merris himself, and called the river and the city thereby Meroe. And this Merris is honoured by the people of the country not less highly than Isis.

17
Ἀάρωνα δὲ τὸν τοῦ Μωΰσου ἀδελφὸν τὰ περὶ τὴν ἐπιβουλὴν ἐπιγνόντα συμβουλεῦσαι τῷ ἀδελφῷ φυγεῖν εἰς τὴν Ἀραβίαν· τὸν δὲ πεισθέντα, ἀπὸ Μέμφεως τὸν Νεῖλον διαπλεύσαντα, ἀπαλλάσσεσθαι εἰς τὴν Ἀραβίαν.

'Then Aaron the brother of Moses, having learned about the plot, advised his brother to flee into Arabia; and he took the advice, and sailed across the Nile from Memphis, intending to escape into Arabia.

18
τὸν δὲ Χανεθώθην

434

πυθόμενον τοῦ Μωΰσου τὴν φυγὴν ἐνεδρεύειν ὡς ἀναιρήσοντα· ἰδόντα δὲ ἐρχόμενον σπάσασθαι τὴν μάχαιραν ἐπ αὐτὸν, τὸν δὲ Μώϋσον προκαταταχήσαντα τήν τε χεῖρα κατασχεῖν αὐτοῦ καὶ σπασάμενον τὸ ξίφος φονεῦσαι τὸν Χανεθώθην·

'But when Chanethothes was informed of the flight of Moses, he lay in ambush intending to kill him; and when he saw him coming, he drew his sword against him, but Moses was too quick for him, and seized his hand, and drew his sword and slew Chanethothes.

19
διεκδρᾶναι δὲ εἰς τὴν Ἀραβίαν, καὶ Ραγουήλῳ τῷ τῶν τόπων ἄρχοντι συμβιοῦν, λαβόντα τὴν ἐκείνου θυγατέρα· τὸν δὲ Ραγουῆλον βούλεσθαι στρα-

'So he made his escape into Arabia, and lived with Raguel the ruler of the district, having married his daughter. And Raguel wished to make an expedition against the Egyptians in order to restore Moses, and procure the government for his daughter and son-in-law; but Moses prevented it, out of regard for his own nation: and Raguel forbidding him to march against the Arabs, ordered him to plunder Egypt.

20
ὑπὸ δὲ τὸν αὐτὸν χρόνον καὶ τὸν Χενεφρῆν πρῶτον ἁπάντων ἀνθρώπων ἐλεφαντιάσαντα μεταλλάξαι ’ τούτῳ δὲ τῷ πάθει περιπεσεῖν διὰ τὸ τοὺς Ἰουδαίους προσ- τάξαι σινδόνας ἀμφιέννυσθαι , ἐρεᾶν δ’ ἐσθῆτα μὴ

c
αὐτοῦ.

'About the same time Chenephres died, having been the very first person attacked by elephantiasis; and he is said to have incurred this misfortune because he ordered the Jews to wear linen garments and not to wear woollen clothing, in order that they might be conspicuous, and be punished by him.

21
τὸν δὲ Μώϋσον εὔχεσθαι τῷ θεῷ, ἤδη ποτὲ τοὺς λαοὺς παῦσαι τῶν κακοπαθειῶν. ἱλασκομένου δ’ αὐτοῦ αἰφνιδίως φησὶν ἐκ τῆς γῆς πῦρ ἀναφθῆναι, καὶ τοῦτο κάεσθαι, μήτε ὕλης μήτε ἄλλης

'But Moses prayed to God now at last to put an end to the sufferings of the tribes. And God being propitiated, fire, it is said, suddenly blazed up out of the earth, and went on burning though there was no wood nor any other fuel in the place. And Moses was frightened at the occurrence and took to flight; but a divine voice spake to him, to march against Egypt, and rescue the Jews and lead them into their old country.

22
τὸν δὲ θαρρήσαντα δύναμιν πολεμίαν ἐπάγειν διαγνῶναι

ἀπολῦσαι τοὺς Ἰουδαίους.

'So he took courage and determined to lead a hostile force against the Egyptians: but first he came to his brother Aaron. And when the king of Egypt heard of the arrival of Moses, he called him before him, and asked what he had come for: and he said, Because the Lord of the world commanded him to deliver the Jews.

23
τὸν δὲ πυθόμενον εἰς φυλακὴν αὐτὸν καθεῖρξαι. νυκτὸς δὲ ἐπιγενομένης

254

'And when the king heard this, he shut him up in prison. But when it was night, all the doors of the prison-house opened of their own accord, and of the guards some died, and some were sunk in sleep, and their weapons broken in pieces.'

24
ἐξελθόντα δὲ τὸν Μώϋσον ἐπὶ τὰ βασίλεια ἐλθεῖν· εὑρόντα δὲ ἀνεῳγμένας τὰς θύρας

εἰσελθεῖν, καὶ ἐνθάδε τῶν φυλάκων παρειμένων τὸν βασιλέα ἐξεγεῖραι. τὸν δὲ ἐκπλαγέντα ἐπὶ τῷ γεγο- νότι κελεῦσαι τῷ Μωΰσῳ τὸ τοῦ πέμψαντος αὐτὸν
435
θεοῦ εἰπεῖν ὄνομα, διαχλευάσαντα αὐτόν·

'So Moses passed out and came to the palace; and finding the doors opened he went in, and the guards here also being sunk in sleep he woke up the king. And he being dismayed at what had happened bade Moses tell him the name of the God who sent him, scoffing at him: 

25
τὸν δὲ
προσκύψαντα πρὸς τὸ οὖς εἰπεῖν, ἀκούσαντα δὲ τὸν βασιλέα πεσεῖν ἄφωνον, διακρατηθέντα δὲ ὑπὸ τοῦ Μωΰσου πάλιν ἀναβιῶσαι·

but Moses bent down and whispered in his ear, and when the king heard it he fell speechless, but was held fast by Moses and came to life again.

26
γράψαντα δὲ τοὔνομα εἰς δέλτον κατασφραγίσασθαι· τῶν δὲ ἱερέων τὸν ἐκφαυλίσαντα ἐν τῇ πινακίδι τὰ γεγραμμένα μετὰ
σπασμοῦ τὸν βίον ἐκλιμπάνειν·

'And he wrote the name in a tablet and sealed it up; and one of the priests who made light of what was written in the tablet was seized with a convulsion and died.'

27
εἰπεῖν τε τὸν βασιλέα σημεῖόν τι αὐτῷ ποιήσαι· τὸν δὲ Μώϋσον ἣν εἶχε ῥάβδον ἐκβαλόντα ὄφιν ποιῆσαι ’ πτοηθέντων

b
δὲ πάντων, ἐπιλαβόμενον τῆς οὐρᾶς ἀνελέσθαι, καὶ πάλιν ῥάβδον ποιῆσαι·

'Also the king told him to work some sign for him, and Moses threw down the rod which he held and turned it into a serpent; and when they were all frightened, he seized it by the tail and took it up, and made it a rod again.

28
προελθόντα δὲ μικρὸν
τὸν Νεῖλον τῇ ῥάβδῳ πατάξαι ’ τὸν δὲ ποταμὸν πολύχουν γενόμενον κατακλύζειν ὅλην τὴν Αἴγυπτον· ἀπὸ τότε δὲ καὶ τὴν κατάβασιν αὐτοῦ γίνεσθαι· συναγαγὸν δὲ τὸ ὕδωρ ἀποζέσαι καὶ τὰ ποτάμια διαφθεῖραι ζῷα, τούς τε λαοὺς διὰ τὴν δίψαν φθείρεσθαι.

'Then he went forth a little, and smote the Nile with the rod, and the river became flooded and deluged the whole of Egypt, and it was from that time its inundation began: and the water became stagnant, and stank, and killed all living things in the river, and the people were perishing of thirst.

29
τὸν δὲ βασιλέα, τούτων γενομένων τῶν τεράτων, φάναι μετὰ μῆνα τοὺς λαοὺς ἀπολύσειν, ἐὰν ἀποκαταστήσῃ τὸν ποταμόν ’ τὸν δὲ Μώϋσον

c
πάλιν τῇ ῥάβδῳ πατάξαντα τὸ ὕδωρ συστεῖλαι τὸ ῥεῦμα.

'But when these wonders had been wrought, the king said that after a month he would let the people go, if Moses would restore the river to its proper state; and he smote the water again with his rod, and checked the stream.

30
τούτου δὲ γενομένου τὸν βασιλέα τοὺς
ἱερεῖς τοὺς ὑπὲρ Μέμφιν καλέσαι, καὶ φάναι αὐτοὺς ἀναιρήσειν, καὶ τὰ ἱερὰ κατασκάψειν, ἐὰν μὴ καὶ αὐτοὶ τερατουργήσωσί τι. τοὺς δὲ τότε διά τινων μαγγάνων καὶ ἐπαοιδῶν δράκοντα ποιῆσαι καὶ τὸν ποταμὸν μεταχρῶσαι.

'When this was done, the king summoned the priests from above Memphis, and said that he would kill them all, and demolish the temples, unless they also would work some wonder. And then they by some witchcraft and incantations made a serpent, and changed the colour of the river.

31
τὸν δὲ βασιλέα φρονηματισθέντα
ἐπὶ τῷ γεγονότι, πάσῃ τιμωρίᾳ καὶ κολάσει καταικίζειν τοὺς Ἰουδαίους. τὸν δὲ Μώϋσον ταῦτα ὁρῶντα ἄλλα τε σημεῖα ποιήσαι καὶ πατάξαντα τὴν

v.1.p.504
γῆν τῇ ῥάβδῳ ζῷόν τι πτηνὸν ἀνεῖναι λυμαίνεσθαι
d
τοὺς Αἰγυπτίους, πάντα τε ἐξελκωθῆναι τὰ σώματα. τῶν δὲ ἰατρῶν μὴ δυναμένων ἰᾶσθαι τοὺς κάμνοντας, οὕτω πάλιν ἀνέσεως τυχεῖν τοὺς Ἰουδαίους.

'And the king, being puffed up with pride at what was done, began to maltreat the Jews with every kind of vengeance and punishment. Then Moses, seeing this, both wrought other signs, and also smote the earth with his rod, and brought up a kind of winged animal to harass the Egyptians, and all their bodies broke out in boils. And as the physicians were unable to heal the sufferers, the Jews thus again gained relief.

32
πάλιν τε τὸν Μώϋσον βάτραχον διὰ τῆς ῥάβδου
ἀνεῖναι, πρὸς δὲ τούτοις ἀκρίδας καὶ σκνίφας. διὰ τοῦτο δὲ καὶ τοὺς Αἰγυπτίους τὴν ῥάβδον ἀνατιθέναι εἰς πὰν ἱερὸν, ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ τῇ Ἴσιδι, διὰ τὸ τὴν γῆν εἶναι Ἰσιν, παιομένην δὲ τῇ ῥάβδῳ τὰ τέρατα ἀνεῖναι.

'Again Moses by his rod brought up frogs, and besides them locusts and lice. And for this reason the Egyptians dedicate the rod in every temple, and to Isis likewise, because the earth is Isis, and sent up these wonders when smitten by the rod.

33
τοῦ δὲ βασιλέως ἔτι ἀφρονουμένου τὸν
Μώϋσον χάλαζάν τε καὶ σεισμοὺς διὰ νυκτὸς ἀποτελέσαι, ὥστε τοὺς τὸν σεισμὸν φεύγοντας ἀπὸ τῆς χαλάζης ἀναιρεῖσθαι, τούς τε τὴν χάλαζαν ἐκκλίνοντας

436
ὑπὸ τῶν σεισμῶν διαφθείρεσθαι. συμπεσεῖν δὲ τότε τὰς μὲν οἰκίας πάσας τῶν τε ναῶν τοὺς πλείστους.

'But as the king still persisted in his folly, Moses caused hail and earthquakes by night, so that those who fled from the earthquake were killed by the hail, and those who sought shelter from the hail were destroyed by the earthquakes. And at that time all the houses fell in, and most of the temples.

34
τελευταῖον τοιαύταις συμφοραῖς περιπεσόντα τὸν βασιλέα τοὺς Ἰουδαίους ἀπολῦσαι ’ τοὺς δὲ χρησαμένους παρὰ τῶν Αἰγυπτίων πολλὰ μὲν ἐκπώματα, οὐκ ὀλίγον δὲ ἱματισμὸν ἄλλην τε παμπληθῆ γάζαν, διαβάντας τοὺς κατὰ τὴν Ἀραβίαν
ποταμοὺς, καὶ διαβάντας ἱκανὸν τόπον ἐπὶ τὴν ἐρυθρὰν τριταίους ἐλθεῖν θάλασσαν.


'At last after having incurred such calamities the king let the Jews go: and they, after borrowing from the Egyptians many drinking-vessels, and no little raiment, and very much other treasure, crossed the rivers on the Arabian side, and after traversing a wide space came on the third day to the Red Sea.

35
Μεμφίτας μὲν οὖν λέγειν ἔμπειρον ὄντα τὸν Μώϋσον τῆς χώρας

b
τὴν ἄμπωτιν τηρήσαντα διὰ ξηρᾶς τῆς θαλάσσης τὸ πλῆθος περαιῶσαι. Ἡλιουπολίτας δὲ λέγειν ἐπικαταδραμεῖν
τὸν βασιλέα μετὰ πολλῆς δυνάμεως, ἄμα] καὶ τοῖς καθιερωμένοις ζῴοις, διὰ τὸ τὴν ὕκαρξιν τοὺς Ἰουδαίους τῶν Αἰγυπτίων χρησαμένους
255
διακομίζειν.

'Now the people of Memphis say, that Moses being acquainted with the country waited for the ebb, and took the people across the sea when dry. But the people of Heliopolis say, that the king hastened after them with a great force, having also with him the consecrated animals, because the Jews were carrying off the property which they had borrowed from the Egyptians.

36
τῷ δὲ Μωΰσῳ θείαν φωνὴν γενέσθαι πατάξαι τὴν θάλασσαν τῇ ῥάβδῳ καὶ διαστῆναι.
τὸν δὲ Μώϋσον ἀκούσαντα ἐπιθιγεῖν τῇ ῥάβδῳ τοῦ ὕδατος, καὶ οὕτω τὸ μὲν νᾶμα διαστῆναι, τὴν δὲ

v.1.p.505
δύναμιν διὰ ξηρᾶς ὁδοῦ πορεύεσθαι.

'There came, however, to Moses a divine voice bidding him to smite the sea with the rod [and that it should divide]: and when Moses heard it, he touched the water with the rod, and so the stream divided, and the force passed over by a dry path.

37
συνεμβάντων

c
δ’ ἑ τῶν Αἰγυπτίων καὶ διωκόντων φησὶ πῦρ αὐτοῖς ἐκ τῶν ἔμπροσθεν ἐκλάμψαι, τὴν δὲ θάλασσαν πάλιν τὴν ὁδὸν ἐπικλύσαι· τοὺς δὲ Αἰγυπτίους
ὑπό τε τοῦ πυρὸς καὶ τῆς πλημμυρίδος πάντας διαφθαρῆναι· τοὺς δὲ Ἰουδαίους διαφυγόντας τὸν κίνδυνον τεσσαράκοντα ἴτη ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ διατρῖψαι, βρέχοντος αὐτοῖς τοῦ θεοῦ κρίμνον ὅμοιον ἐλύμῳ, χιόνι παραπλήσιον τὴν χρόαν. γεγονέναι δέ φησι
τὸν Μώϋσον μακρὸν, πυρρακῆ, πολιὸν, κομήτην, ἀξιωματικόν. ταῦτα δὲ πρᾶξαι περὶ ἔτη ὄντα ὀγδοήκοντα
d
ἐννέα.”

'But when the Egyptians went in with them and were pursuing them, a fire, it is said, shone out upon them from the front, and the sea overflowed the path again, and the Egyptians were all destroyed by the fire and the flood: but the Jews having escaped this danger spent forty years in the wilderness, God raining down meal for them like millet, similar in colour to snow. And Moses they say was tall and ruddy, with long white hair, and dignified: and he performed these deeds when he was about eighty-nine years old.'
