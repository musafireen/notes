نَهَانِيَ عَقِلِي عَن أُمُورٍ كَثِيرَةٍ وطبعي إليها بالغريزة جاذبي

Reason forbade me many things whereto Instinctively my nature's bias drew;

وَمِمَّا أَدامَ الرُزْءَ تَكذِيبُ صَادِقٍ عَلَى خُبِرَةٍ مِنَّا وَتَصدِيقُ كَاذِبِ

And 'tis perpetual loss if, knowing, I Believe a falsehood or give Truth the lie.

أَمَّا الْيَقِينُ فَلَا يَقِينَ وَإِنَّمَا أقصى اجتهادي أَن أَظُنُّ وَأَحدِسا

As for certainty, there is none, My best effort is to guess and conjecture.

دَفَنَّاهُمُ فِي الْأَرْضِ دَمْنَ تَيَقُنِ وَلَا عَلِمَ بِالْأَرواحِ غَيْرَ ظُنُونِ

We buried our dead in the ground with certainty, But there is no knowledge of spirits other than suspicion.

إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ فِي ضَلَالٍ وَتَعْلي لٍ فَإِن كُنتَ ذَا يَقِينِ فَهَاتِهِ

We are in error and delusion. If thou hast a certainty, produce it!

لَو لَا بَدَائِعُ دَلَّت أَنَّ خَالِقَنَا أدرى و أحكم قُلنا خَلَقْنَا لَم

If there were no wonderful creations proving that our Creator is all-knowing and all-wise, we would say that creating us was a sin.

فَلَا تَحسَبٍ مَقَالَ الرُّسُلِ حَقاً ولكِن قَولُ رُورٍ سَطُرُوهُ

وكان الناسُ في عَيش رغيد فجاؤوا بالمحال وكدروه

Do not suppose the statements of the prophets to be true; they are all fabrications.
Men lived comfortably till they came and spoiled life.

لا إمام سوى العقل مشيراً في صُبحِه والمَساءِ

There's no Imam but Reason To point the morning and the evening ways.

هَفَتِ الحَنِيفَةُ وَالنَّصارى ما اهتدت وَيَهودُ حَارَت وَالْمَجُوسُ مُضَلُّله اثنانِ أَهْلُ الْأَرْضِ ذو عَقلِ بِلا دِينٍ وَآخَرُ دَيِّنٌ لَا عَقَلَ لَهُ

Hanifs (Muslims) are stumbling, Christians all astray Jews wildered, Magians far on error's way.
We mortals are composed of two great schools: those with intellect but no religion, and those with religion but no intellect.



و كيف أقضي ساعة بِمَسَرَّة وأعْلَمُ أَنَّ الْمَوتَ مِن غُرَمائي

How can I spend an hour happily, knowing that death is my enemy?

فما لِلفَتَى إِلَّا انفِرادُ وَوَحدَةٌ إذا هُوَ لَم يُرْزَقَ بُلُوغَ الْمَارِبِ

What choice hath a man except seclusion and loneliness, When Destiny grants him not the gaining of that he craves?

فحارِب وَسَالِم إِنْ أَرَدتَ فَإِنَّمَا أخو السلم في الأَيَّامِ مِثْلُ مُحارِبِ

Make peace, if thou wilt, or war: the Days with indifferent hand Their measure mete out alike to warrior and friend of peace

ما باختياري ميلادي ولا هرمي ولا حياتي فَهَل لي بعد تخيير

Neither my birth nor my old age nor my life was of my own volition. So do I still have free will?

والعَيشُ سُقِمُ لِلفَتَى مُنصِبٌ
والموتُ يَأْتِي بِشِفاء السقام

Life is a painful disease for men, And death brings the cure for this disease

خَفَفِ الْوَطْعَ مَا أَظُنُّ أَدِيمَ الَّـ أَرْضِ إِلَّا مِنْ هَذِهِ الْأَجْسَادِ

Soften your tread. Methinks the earth's surface is but bodies of the dead.

سِر إِنِ اسْطَعْتَ فِي الْهَوَاءِ رُوَيْدًا لا اخْتِيَالًا عَلَى رُفَاتِ الْعِبَادِ

Walk, if you can, gently in the air, and not arrogantly on the remains of people

أراني في الثلاثَةِ مِن سُجون فلا تَسْأَلُ عَنِ الخَبَرِ النَّبِيثِ

I see myself trapped in three prisons donnot ask me about the evil news.

لِفَقَدِيَ نَاظِرِي وَلُزُومِ بَيتي وَكُون النَّفْسِ في الجَسَدِ الخَبِيثِ

My prisons are blindness, being confined in home and being trapped in an evil body

إذا كَثُرَ النَّاسُ شِاعَ الفَسَادُ
كَمَا فَسَدَ القَولُ لَّمَا كَثُرَ

When there are many people, corruption becomes widespread, just as speech becomes corrupted when there is a large amount of it.

تَخَيَّرٍ فَإِمَّا وَحدَةٌ مِثْلُ مَيتَةٍ
وَإِمَّا جَليس في الحياةِ مُنافق

You must choose, either a solitude like death or the company of hypocrites.

والأرضُ لَيسَ بِمَرْجُو طَهَارَتُها إلا إذا زَالَ عَنْ آفَاقِها الأَنَسُ

The earth is not one to hope for its purity,
Unless human beings disappear from its horizons.

تَناسَلُوا فَنَمَى شَرٌّ بِنَسْلِهِمُ وَكَم فُجُورٍ إِذا شُبّانَهُم عَنَسُوا

They reproduced and evil increased by their children,
If their youth had avoided marriage evil would not be this much.

وَإِذا أَرَدتُم لِلبَنِينَ كَرَامَةً فَالحَزْمُ أَجْمَعُ تَرَكُهُم في الأظهر

If ye unto your sons would prove, By act how dearly them ye love, Then every voice of wisdom joins To bid you leave them in your loins.

In pleasures is no stay: their sweets beguile At first, but ah the bitter after-while! Time vowed we all to dust should surely come, And sent, to search us out, the messengers of doom. Man, once enriched by Death, wants nothing more; A child receives Life's breath, and he is poor."

خَيْرٌ لِآدَمَ وَالخَلْقِ الَّذِي خَرَجوا من ظهرِه أَن يَكُونُوا قَبْلُ مَا خُلِقوا

Better for Adam and all who issued forth from his loins that he and they, yet unborn, created never had been! For whilst his body was dust and rotten bones in the earth.
Ah, did he feel what his children saw and suffered of woe?

فَهَل أَحَسٌ وَبَالِ جِسْمِهِ رِمَمٌ بِمَا رَآهُ بَنوهُ مِن أَذًى وَلَقُوا

And now these Daughters of my heart and mind, I shield and keep secluded from mankind; They seek no son of man to win his heart, Nor will they even wed a world unkind.

Do yonder birds, that labour with such zest, Know, like ourselves, that there can be no rest? Were they but conscious of the world's
design,
They would not build their young that cozy nest.

أرى النسل ذنباً للفتى لا يُقالُهُ فَلَا تَنكِحَنَّ الدَهْرَ غَيْرَ عَقِيمٍ

Procreation is an unforgivable sin, So never marry any woman except a barren one.

This pleasure, born of pain and misery, No wretched Soul inherit shall from me; I dig not, like the Lizard, for her cubs, Nor bird-like toil and moil for chicks to be.

على الوُلدِ يَجِني والِدٌ، وَلَو أَنَّهُم ولاةُ عَلَى أَمصارِهِم، خُطباء

Fathers commit a crime on their children, Even if they become governors over their lands or preachers.

This world is such an abode that if those present here Have their wits entire, they will never weep for the absent ones.

ولستُ أدرى سِوَى أَنِّي أرى رَجُلًا يَرُبّ نسلا لِرَيبِ الدَهرِ قد غلطا

I know but this, that him I hold in error Who helps to propagate Time's woe and terror

Our Nights and Days around each other spin, And we like Planets end as we begin; Our feet are on the heads of those that passed, And as the Cradle cries, the Graves all grin.

وَلَيتَ وَليداً مَاتَ سَاعَةَ وَضِعِهِ وَلَم يَرْتَضِعِ مِن أُمِّهِ النُّفَسَاءِ

Would that a lad had died in the very hour of birth And never sucked, as she lay in childbed, his mother's breast!

يَقُولُ لَها مِن قَبْلِ نُطْقٍ لِسَانِهِ تفيدينَ بي أَن تُنكَبِي وَتُسائي

Her babe, it says to her or ever its tongue can speak, Nothing thou gett'st of me but sorrow and bitter pain.

The warp and woof of Life are woe and gloom; The Cup is bitter; endless pain the doom: Strange then that he should weave, that he should drink,
Who knows well how to smash both Cup and Loom!

وَإِذَا افْتَكَرتُ فَمَا يَهِيجُ تَفَكَّرِي فيما أُكَابِدُ غَيْرَ لَومِ النَّاجِلِ

وَأَرَحتُ أولادي فَهُم في نِعْمَةِ ال عَدَمِ الَّتِي فَضَلَت نَعِيمَ العَاجِلِ

وَلَو أَنَّهُم ظَهَرُوا لَعانوا شِدَّةً ترميهُمُ في مُتلِفَاتِ هَوَاجِلِ

Whenever I reflect, my reflecting upon what I suffer only rouses me to blame him that begot me. And I gave peace to my children, for they are in the bliss of nonexistence which surpasses all the pleasures of this world. Had they come to life, they would have endured a misery casting them to destruction in trackless wildernesses.

Soul that had not entered yet a pot Longed, from her height, to throw with ours her lot; She sent a harbinger to sound the Depth; The harbinger below cried out: "Do not!"

وإذا الفتى كَانَ التُرابُ مَالَهُ فَعَلامَ تَسْهَرُ أُمُّهُ وَ تُرَبِّتُ

When soil is the destination of man, for what reason does his mother stay up late and raise him then?

By Allah's will preserving From misflight, The barbs of Time unswerving On us alight.
A loan is all he gives And takes again; With his gift happy lives The folly of men.

Nor birth I chose nor old age nor to live : What the Past grudged me shall the Present give? Here must I stay, by Doom's both hands constrained, Nor go until my going is ordained.
You who would guide me out of dark illusion, You lie your story does but make confusion. For can you alter that you brand with shame, Or is it not unalterably the same?

Ah, let us go, whom nature gave firm minds And taught us to hold courage firmly fast, To meet the fates pursuing us, that we may die at last. The draught of life, to me it seems a bitter thing to drain; And see, in bitter truth, we spew it out again.

Refrain from procreation, for its consequence is death.

I see but a single part of sweet in the many sour, And Wisdom that cries, "Beget no children, if thou art wise"

Make not, when you work a deed of shame, The scoundrel's plea, 'My forbears did the same.'

Refrain from procreation, for its consequence is death.

If you must wed, take care to have no children;

Amends are richly due from sire to son: What if thy children rule o'er cities great? Their nobleness estranges them the more From thee and causes them to wax in hate, Beholding one that cast them into Life's Dark labyrinth whence no wit can extricate.

Humanity, in whom the best Of this world's features are expressed The chiefs set over them to reign Are but as moons that wax and wane. If ye unto your sons would prove By act how dearly them ye love, Then every voice of wisdom joins To bid you leave them in your loins.

Upon the hazard of Life doth man come into the world Against his will, and departs a loser chafed and chagrined.
He seweth, stitch after stitch, his sins to clothe him withal, As though the crown of his head were ne'er with hoariness sown.

Whenever a babe first cries, its parents and kinsfolk say (Tho' mutely!),
The darts of Change will fall thick and fast: Endure!
The world made us miserable, albeit we loved it long:
Now try it and pass, thou too, thy lifetime in misery.
And show not as if to thee 'twere nothing, for each of us
Bears witness that in his heart it wakens a fierce desire.

Sore, sore the barren one's grief: no child conceived she and bare; Yet that is better for her, with right thought were she but blest.
Death taketh naught from a lonely
soul excepting itself, When as he musters his might and
of a sudden waylays. Alas, the crier of good no ear
inclineth to him: Good, since the world was, hath been a lost thing ever unsought.

Heedlessly Heedlessly Heedlessly souls fought over life's spoils you should too if you can.
Being here Being here Being here is ruin to me like I'm already gone although I remain.
Once you're born you start to die the greatest gift.

Fate stalked us for so long it's like the stars are grey bits on the black hair of night.
Who chases the world walks weakly and the night flees although it covers him.
Human love of error is honed through duels of race and creed the present's tiny step is swifter than a stallion.


هذا جَنَاهُ أَبِي عَلَيَّ وَمَا جَنَيْتُ عَلَى أَحَدٌ

This is my father's crime against me, which I myself committed against none.

Nay, in a wry, old earthen bowl I drink; Tho' in a sea of pearls and gold I sink; The wooden shoes I do like them best That skin did once live, aye, and even think.

وحدثت أنه مرض مرةً فوصف الطبيب له الفروج ، فلما جيء به لمسه بيده وقال : استضعفوك فوصفوك ، هلا وصفوا شبل الأسد ؟! وقيل إنه قال : ما أريد
إصلاح نفسي بإفساد هذا ، ولم يتناوله

They found you weak so they prescribed eating you. Why didn't they prescribe eating a lion's cub? I don't want to gain health by killing.


غَدَوتَ مُريضَ العقل والدين فَالقَني لِتَسْمَعَ أَنبَاءَ الأُمورِ الصَّحَائِحِ
فَلَا تَأْكُلَن مَا أَخْرَجَ المَاءُ ظَالِماً ولا تبغ قوتاً مِن غَرِيضِ الذُّبَائِحِ
وَأَبيضَ أُمَاتٍ أَرَادَت صَرِيحَهُ لأطفالها دون الغواني الصرائح
وَلا تَفْجَعَنَّ الطَّيرَ وَهِيَ غَوافِلُ بِما وَضَعَت فَالظُّلْمُ شَرُّ القَبَائِحِ
وَدَع ضَربَ النَّحْلِ الَّذِي بَكَرَت لَهُ گواسبَ مِن أَزْهَارِ نَبْتٍ فَوَائِحِ
فَما أَحْرَزَتَهُ كَي يَكُونَ لِغَيْرِها وَلا جَمَعَتَهُ لِلنَّدَى وَالْمَنَائِحِ
مَسَحْتُ يَدَي مِن كُلِّ هَذَا فَلَيتَنِي أبهتُ لِشَأْنِي قَبْلَ شَيبِ المَسائِحِ

You are diseased in understanding and religion. Come to me, that you may hear something of sound truth. Do not unjustly eat fish the water has given up, And do not desire as food the flesh of slaughtered animals, Or the white milk of mothers who intended its pure draught
for their young, not noble ladies. And do not grieve the unsuspecting birds by taking eggs; for injustice is the worst of crimes.
And spare the honey which the bees get industriously from the flowers of fragrant plants; For they did not store it that it might belong to others, Nor did they gather it for bounty and gifts. I washed my hands of all this; and wish that I Perceived my way before my hair went gray!

Hunt not the beast; O, be thou more humane, Since hunter here nor hunted long remain; The smallest grub a life has in it which Thou canst not take without inflicting pain.

For me thy silks and feathers have no charm, The pillow I like best is my right arm ; The comforts of your Passing Show I spurn In travelling, and I heed not your alarm.

I see how the living things of earth dread their doom: to them Despair with the thunder comes and hope with the lightning. Feel safe and secure, O bird ! and thou fear not, O gazelle, I'll harm thee: in fortune we are one, undivided.

Equal are a kind mother who gave food to a child in
his cradle and a dove that fed her chick.
Never, then, hasten, knife in hand, to destroy a
young bird that hopped about in its dwelling-places.

Give a drink of water as alms to the birds which
go forth at morning,
and deem that they have a better right than men (to thy charity),
For their race brings not harm upon thee in any wise, when thou fearest it from thine own race.

To let go from my hand a flea that I have caught is a kinder act than to bestow a dirhem on a man in need.
There is no difference between the black earless creature which I release and the Black Prince of Kinda who bound the tiara (on his head).
Both of them take precaution (against death); and life is dear to it (the flea), and it passionately desires the means of living.

To prove the point, the work presents a gallery of horrors committed by people against animals-including forming bonds with livestock only to kill them and hunting wild gazelle, leaving their orphaned young. But the most ghoulish methods are those ostensibly practised by Bedouin Arabs. For instance, they might waterlog their camels before a long journey and then pierce their stomachs to drink the excess liquid, or slaughter them so that encroaching predators would be drawn to the dead beasts instead of humans. "No animal has endured torture from the Sons of Eve like the camel has," bemoans the horse.
