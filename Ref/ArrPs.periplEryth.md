## 1
Of the designated ports on the Erythraean Sea, and the market-towns around it, the first is the Egyptian port of Mussel Harbor. To those sailing down from that place, on the right hand, after eighteen hundred stadia, there is Berenice. The harbors of both are at the boundary of Egypt, and are bays opening from the Erythraean Sea.

## 2
On the right-hand coast next below Berenice is the country of the Berbers. Along the shore are the Fish-Eaters, living in scattered caves in the narrow valleys. Further inland are the Berbers, and beyond them the Wild-flesh-Eaters and Calf-Eaters, each tribe governed by its chief; and behind them, further inland, in the country toward the west, there lies a city called Meroe.

Τούτων ἐκ μὲν τῶν δεξιῶν ἀπὸ Βερνίκης συναφής ἐστιν ἡ Βαρβαρικὴ χώρα. Καὶ ἔστι τὰ μὲν παρὰ θάλασσαν Ἰχθυοφάγων [ἐν] μάνδραις ᾠκοδομημέναις ἐν στενώμασι σποράδην διοικούντων, τὰ δὲ μεσόγεια
Βαρβάρων καὶ τῶν μετʼ αὐτοὺς Ἀγριοφάγων καὶ Μοσχοφάγων κατὰ τυραννίδα νεμομένων, οἷς ἐπίκειται κατὰ νώτου μεσόγειος ἀπὸ τῶν πρὸς δύσιν μερῶν [μητρόπολις λεγομένη Μερόη].
## 3
Below the Calf-Eaters there is a little market-town on the shore after sailing about four thousand stadia from Berenice, called Ptolemais of the Hunts, from which the hunters started for the interior under the dynasty of the Ptolemies. This market-town has the true land-tortoise in small quantity; it is white and smaller in the shells. And here also is found a little ivory, like that of Adulis. But the place has no harbor and is reached only by small boats.

## 4
Below Ptolemais of the Hunts, at a distance of about three thousand stadia, there is Adulis, a port established by law, lying at the inner end of a bay that runs in toward the south. Before the harbor lies the so-called Mountain Island, about two hundred stadia sea-ward from the very head of the bay, with the shores of the mainland close to it on both sides. Ships bound for this port now anchor here because of attacks from the land. 

4 Μετὰ δὲ τὴν Πτολεμαΐδα τὴν τῶν θηρῶν ἀπὸ σταδίων ὡς τριςχιλίων ἐμπόριόν ἐστι νόμιμον ἡ Ἀδουλὶ, κείμενον ἐν κόλπῳ βαθεῖ κατ αὐτὸν τὸν νότον, οὖ πρόκειται νῆσος Ὀρεινὴ λεγομένη, τοῦ μὲν ἐσωτάτου
κόλπου σταδίους ὡς εἰς πέλαγος ἀπέχουσα διακοσίους,

260
ἐξ ἀμφοτέρων [δὲ] τῶν μερῶν παρακειμένην ἔχουσα τὴν ἤπειρον, ἐν ᾗ νῦν ὁρμεῖ τὰ καταγόμενα πλοῖα διὰ τὰς ἐκ τῆς γῆς καταδρομάς. 

They used formerly to anchor at the very head of the bay, by an island called Diodorus, close to the shore, which could be reached on foot from the land; by which means the barbarous natives attacked the island. 

Πρῶτον μὲν γὰρ ὥρμει κατʼ αὐτὸν τὸν ἐσώτατον κόλπον ἐν τῆ Διοδώρου λεγο
μένη νήσῳ παῤ αὐτήν τὴν ἤπειρον, ἐχούσῃ πεζῇ τὴν διάβασιν, διʼ ἧς οἱ κατοικοῦντες βάρβαροι κατέτρεχον τὴν νῆσον. 

Opposite Mountain Island, on the mainland twenty stadia from shore, lies Adulis, a fair-sized village, from which there is a three-days' journey to Coloe, an inland town and the first market for ivory. 

Καὶ κατʼ αὐτὴν τὴν ἐν τῇ Ὀρεινῇ ἤπειρον ἀπὸ σταδίων εἴκοσι τῆς θαλάσσης ἐστὶν ἡ Ἀδουλὶ μari κώμη σύμμετρος, ἀφʼ ἧς εἰς μὲν Κολόην μεσόγειον
πόλιν καὶ πρῶτον ἐμπόριον τοῦ ἐλέφαντος, ὁδός ἐστιν ἡμερῶν τριῶν. 

From that place to the city of the people called Auxumites there is a five days' journey more; to that place all the ivory is brought from the country beyond the Nile through the district called Cyeneum, and thence to Adulis. Practically the whole number of elephants and rhinoceros that are killed live in the places inland, although at rare intervals they are hunted on the seacoast even near Adulis. 

Ἀπὸ δὲ ταύτης εἰς αὐτὴν τὴν μετρόπολιν τῶν Aὐξωμιτῶν λεγομένων ἄλλων ἡμερῶν πέντε, εἰς ἣν ὁ πᾶς ἐλέφας ἀπὸ τοῦ πέραν τοῦ Νείλου φέρεται διὰ τοῦ λεγομένου Κυηνείου, ἐκεῖθεν δὲ εἰς Ἀδουλί,
Τὸ μὲν οὖν ὅλον πλῆθος τῶν φονευομένων ἐλεφάντων ἢ ῥινοκερώτων περὶ τοὺς ἄνω νέμεται τόπους, σπανίως δέ ποτε καὶ ἐν τῷ παρὰ θάλασσαν περὶ αὐτὴν τὴν Ἀδουλὶ θεωροῦνται. 

Before the harbor of that market-town, out at sea on the right hand, there lie a great many little sandy islands called Alalaei, yielding tortoise-shell, which is brought to market there by the Fish-Eaters.

Πρόκεινται δὲ τοῦ ἐμπορίου καὶ
261
κατὰ πέλαγος ἄλλαι νῆσοι μικραὶ ἐκ δεξιῶν ἀμμιναὶ πλείονες, Ἀλαλαίου λεγόμεναι, χελώνην ἔχουσαι τὴν εἰς τὸ ἐμπόριον φερομένην ὑπὸ τῶν Ἰχθυοφάγων.
## 5
And about eight hundred stadia beyond there is another very deep bay, with a great mound of sand piled up at the right of the entrance; at the bottom of which the opsian stone is found, and this is the only place where it is produced. These places, from the Calf-Eaters to the other Berber country, are governed by [Zoscales](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoskales), who is miserly in his ways and always striving for more, but otherwise upright, and acquainted with Greek literature.
## 6
There are imported into these places, undressed cloth made in Egypt for the Berbers; robes from Arsinoe; cloaks of poor quality dyed in colors; double-fringed linen mantles; many articles of flint glass, and others of murrhine, made in Diospolis; and brass, which is used for ornament and in cut pieces instead of coin; sheets of soft copper, used for cooking-utensils and cut up for bracelets and anklets for the women; iron, which is made into spears used against the elephants and other wild beasts, and in their wars.  

6 Προχωρεῖ δὲ εἰς τοὺς τόπους τούτους ἱμάτια βαρβαρικὰ ἄγναφα τὰ ἐν Aἰγύπτῳ γινόμενα, Ἀρσινοητιικαὶ
στολαὶ καὶ ἀβόλλαι νόθοι χρωμάτιναι καὶ λέντια καὶ δικρόσσια καὶ λιθίας ὑαλῆς πλείονα γένη καὶ ἄλλης μορρίνης, τῆς γινομένης ἐν Διοςπόλει, καὶ ὀρείχαλκος,

262
ᾧ χρῶνται πρὸς κόσμον καὶ εἰς συγκοπὴν ἀντὶ νομίσματος, καὶ μελίεφθα χαλκᾶ εἴς τε ἕψησιν καὶ εἰς συγκοπτὴν ψελίων καὶ περισκελίδων τισὶ τῶν γυναικῶν, καὶ σίδηρος ὁ δαπανώμενος εἴς τε λόγχας πρὸς τοὺς
ἐλέφαντας καὶ τὰ ἄλλα θηρία καὶ τοὺς πολέμους. 

Besides these, small axes are imported, and adzes and swords; copper drinking-cups, round and large; a little coin for those coming to the market; wine of Laodicea and Italy, not much; olive oil, not much; for the king, gold and silver plate made after the fashion of the country, and for clothing, military cloaks, and thin coats of skin, of no great value.

Ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ πελύκια προχωρεῖ καὶ σκέπαρνα καὶ μάχαιραι καὶ ποτήρια χαλκᾶ στρογγύλα μεγάλα καὶ δηνάριον ὀλίγον πρὸς τοὺς ἐπιδημοῦντας καὶ οἶνος Λαδικηνὸς καὶ Ἰταλικὸς οὐ πολὺς καὶ ἔλαιον οὐ πολύ·
τῷ δὲ βασιλεῖ ἀργυρώματα καὶ χρυσώματα τοπικῷ ῥυθμῷ κατεσκευασμένα καὶ ἱματίων ἀβόλλαι καὶ καυνάκαι ἁπλοῖ, οὐ πολλοῦ δὲ ταῦτα. 

Likewise from the district of Ariaca across this sea, there are imported Indian iron, and steel, and Indian cotton cloth; the broad cloth called monachê and that called sagimtogênê, and girdles, and coats of skin and mallow-colored cloth, and a few muslins, and colored lac. 

Ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ἔσω τόπων τῆς Ἀραβικῆς σίδηρος Ἰνδικὸς καὶ στόμωμα καὶ ὀθόνιον Ἰνδικὸν τὸ πλατύτερον, ἡ λεγομένη
263
μοναχὴ, καὶ σαγματογῆναι καὶ περιζώματα καὶ καυνάκαι καὶ μολόχινα καὶ σινδόνες ὀλίγαι καὶ λάκκος χρωμάτινος. 

There are exported from these places ivory, and tortoise-shell and rhinoceros-horn. 

Φέρεται δὲ ἀπὸ τῶν τόπων ἐλέφας καὶ χελώνη καὶ ῥινόκερως. 

The most from Egypt is brought to this market from the month of January, to September, that is, from Tybi to Thoth; but seasonably they put to sea about the month of September.

Τὰ δὲ πλεῖστα ἐκ τῆς
Αἰγύπτου φέρεται εἰς τὸ ἐμπόριον τοῦτο ἀπὸ μηνὸς Ἰανουαρίου μέχρι τοῦ Σεπτεμβρίου, ὅ ἐστιν ἀπὸ Τυβὶ ἕως Θώθ· εὐκαίρως δὲ ἀπὸ Αἰγύπτου ἀνάτονται περὶ τὸν Σεπτέμβριον μὴνα.

## 7
From this place the Arabian Gulf trends toward the east and becomes narrowest just before the Gulf of Avalites. After about four thousand stadia, for those sailing eastward along the same coast, there are other Berber market-towns, known as the "far-side" ports; lying at intervals one after the other, without harbors but having roadsteads where ships can anchor and lie in good weather. 

7 Ἤδη [δὲ] ἐπ ἀνατολὴν ὁ Ἀραβικὸς κόλπος διατείνει
καὶ κατὰ τὸν Aὐαλίτην μάλιστα στενοῦται. Μετὰ δὲ σταδίους ὡςεὶ τετρακιςχιλίους, κατὰ τὴν αὐτήν ἤπειρον εἰς ἀνατολὴν πλεόντων, ἔστιν ἄλλα ἐμπόρια Βαρβαρικὰ, τὰ πέραν λεγόμενα, κείμενα μὲν κατὰ τὸ ἑξῆς ἀγκυροβολίοις δὲ καὶ σάλοις ἔχοντα τοὺς ὅρμους κατὰ
καιροὸς ἐπιτηδείους. 

The first is called Avalites; to this place the voyage from Arabia to the far-side coast is the shortest. 

Πρῶτος μὲν ὁ λεγόμενος Aὐαλίτης, καθʼ ὃν καὶ στενώτατός ἐστιν ἀπὸ τῆς Ἀραβικῆς

264
εἰς τὸ πέραν διάπλους. 

Here there is a small market-town called Avalites, which must be reached by boats and rafts. 

Κατὰ τοῦτον τὸν τόπον μικρὸν ἐμπόριόν ἐστιν ὁ Aὐαλίτης, σχεδίαις καὶ σκάφαις εἰς τὸ αὐτὸ προςερχομένων. 

There are imported into this place, flint glass, assorted; juice of sour grapes from Diospolis; dressed cloth, assorted, made for the Berbers; wheat, wine, and a little tin. 

Προχωρεῖ δὲ εἰς αὐτήν ὑαλὴ λιθία σύμμικτος καὶ [χυλὸς] Διοςπολιτικῆς
ὄμφακος καὶ ἱμάτια βαρβαρικὰ σύμμικτα γεγναμμέ καὶ σῖτος καὶ οἶνος καὶ κασσίτερος ὀλίγος. 

There are exported from the same place, and sometimes by the Berbers themselves crossing on rafts to Ocelis and Muza on the opposite shore, spices, a little ivory, tortoise-shell, and a very little myrrh, but better than the rest. 

Φέρεται δʼ ἐξ αὐτῆς, ποτὲ καὶ τῶν βαρβάρων ἐπὶ σχεδίαις διαφερόντων εἰς τὴν ἀντικρὺς Ὄκηλιν καὶ Μούζα, ἀρώματα καὶ ἐλέφας ὀλίγος καὶ χελώνη καὶ σμύρνα ἐλαχίστη,
διαφέρουσα δὲ τῆς ἄλλης. 

And the Berbers who live in the place are very unruly.

Ἀτακτότεροι δὲ κατοικοῦντες τὸν τόπον βάρβαροι
## 8
After Avalites there is another market-town, better than this, called Malao, distant a sail of about eight hundred stadia. The anchorage is an open road-stead, sheltered by a spit running out from the east. Here the natives are more peaceable. 

8 Μετὰ δὲ τὴν Aὐαλίτην ἕτερον ἐμπόριόν ἐστι τούτου διαφέρον ἡ λεγομένη Μαλαὼ, πλοῦν ἀπέχουσα σταδίων ὡς ὀκτακοσίων· ὁ δὲ ὅρμος ἐπίσαλος, σκεπόμενος
ἀκρωτηρίῳ τῷ ἐξ ἀνατολῆς ἀνατείνοντι· οἱ δὲ κατοικοῦντες εἰρηνικώτεροι. 

There are imported into this place the things already mentioned, and many tunics, cloaks from Arsinoe, dressed and dyed; drinking-cups, sheets of soft copper in small quantity, iron, and gold and silver coin, not much. 

Προχωρεῖ δὲ εἰς τοῦτον τὸν τόπον τὰ προειρημένα καὶ πλείονες χιτῶνες, σάγοι Ἀρσινοητικοὶ γεγναμμένοι καὶ βεβαμμένοι καὶ ποτήρια· καὶ μελίεφθα ὀλίγα καὶ σίδηρος καὶ δηνάριον οὐ πολὺ,
χρυσοῦν τε καὶ ἀργυροῦν. 

There are exported from these places myrrh, a little frankincense (that known as “far-side”), the harder cinnamon, duaca, Indian copal and macir, which are imported into Arabia; and slaves, but rarely.

Ἐκφέρεται δὲ ἀπὸ τῶν, τόπων τούτων καὶ σμύρνα καὶ λίβανος ὁ περατικὸς ὀλίγος καὶ κασσία σκληροτέρα καὶ δούακα καὶ κάγκαμον

265
καὶ μάκειρ, τὰ εἰς Ἀραβίαν προχωροῦντα, καὶ σώματα σπανίως.

## 9
Two days' sail, or three, beyond Malao is the market-town of Mundus, where the ships lie at anchor more safely behind a projecting island close to the shore. There are imported into this place the things previously set forth, and from it likewise are exported the merchandise already stated, and the incense called mocrotu. And the traders living here are more quarrelsome.

## 10
Beyond Mundus, sailing toward the east, after another two days' sail, or three, you reach Mosyllum, on a beach, with a bad anchorage. There are imported here the same things already mentioned, also silver plate, a very little iron, and glass. There are shipped from the place a great quantity of cinnamon, (so that this market-town requires ships of larger size), and fragrant gums, spices, a little tortoise shell, and mocrotu, (poorer than that of Mundus), frankincense, (the far-side), ivory and myrrh in small quantities.

## 11
Sailing along the coast beyond Mosyllum, after a two days' course you come to the so-called Little Nile River, and a fine spring, and a small laurel-grove, and Cape Elephant. Then the shore recedes into a bay, and has a river, called Elephant, and a large laurel-grove called Acannae; where alone is produced the far-side frankincense, in great quantity and of the best grade.


## 12
Beyond this place, the coast trending toward the south, there is the Market and Cape of Spices, an abrupt promontory, at the very end of the Berber coast toward the east. The anchorage is dangerous at times from the ground-swell, because the place is exposed to the north. A sign of an approaching storm which is peculiar to the place, is that the deep water becomes more turbid and changes its color. When this happens they all run to a large promontory called Tabae, which offers safe shelter. There are imported into this market-town the things already mentioned; and there are produced in it cinnamon, (and its different varieties, gizir, asypha, arebo, magla, and moto) and frankincense.
## 13
Beyond Tabae, after four hundred stadia, there is the village of Pano. And then, after sailing four hundred stadia along a promontory, toward which place the current also draws you, there is another market-town called [Opone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opone), into which the same things are imported as those already mentioned, and in it the greatest quantity of cinnamon is produced, (the arebo and moto), and slaves of the better sort, which are brought to Egypt in increasing numbers; and a great quantity of tortoise-shell, better than that found elsewhere.

13 Ἀπὸ δὲ Τάβαι μετὰ σταδίους τετρακοσίους παραπλεύσαντι
χερσόνησον, καθʼ ὃν τόπον καὶ ὁ ῥοῦς ἕλκει, ἕτερόν ἐστιν ἐμπόριον Ὀπώνη, εἰς ἣν καὶ αὐτὴν προχωρεῖ μὲν τὰ προειρημένα, τὸ δὲ πλεῖστον ἐν αὐτῇ γεννᾶται κασσία καὶ ἄρωμα καὶ μοτὼ καὶ δουλικὰ κρείσσονα, ἃ εἰς Aἴγυπτον προχωρεῖ μᾶλλον, καὶ χελώνη
πλείστη καὶ διαφορωτέρα τῆς ἄλλης.
## 14
The voyage to all these far-side market-towns is made from Egypt about the month of July, that is Epiphi. 

14 Πλεῖται δὲ εἰς πάντα ταῦτα τὰ τοῦ πέραν ἐμπόρια ἀπὸ μὲν Αἰγύπτου περὶ τὸν Ἰούλιον μῆνα, ὅ ἐστιν Ἐπιφί. 

And ships are also customarily fitted out from the places across this sea, from Ariaca and Barygaza, bringing to these far-side market-towns the products of their own places; wheat, rice, clarified butter, sesame oil, cotton cloth, (the monachê and the sagmatogênê), and girdles, and honey from the reed called sacchari. 

Ἐξαρτίζεται δὲ συνήθως καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ἔσω τόπων, τῆς Ἀριακῆς καὶ Βαρυγάζων, εἰς τὰ αὐτὰ τὰ τοῦ
πέραν ἐμπόρια γένη προχωροῦντα ἀπὸ τῶν τόπων, σῖτος καὶ ὄρυζα καὶ βούτυρον καὶ ἔλαιον σησάμινον καὶ ὀθόνιον, ἥ τε μοναχὴ καὶ ἡ σαγματογήνη, καὶ περιζώματα καὶ μέλι τὸ καλάμινον τὸ λεγόμενον σάκχαρι. 

Some make the voyage especially to these market-towns, and others exchange their cargoes while sailing along the coast. 

Καὶοἱ μὲν προηγουμένως εἰς ταῦτα τὰ ἐμπόρια πλέουσιν,
οἱ δὲ [κατὰ] τὸν παράπλουν ἀντιφορτίζονται τὰ ἐμπεσόντα. 

This country is not subject to a King, but each market-town is ruled by its separate chief.

Οὐ βασιλεύεται δὲ ὁ τόπος, ἀλλὰ τυράννοις ἰδίοις καθʼ ἕκαστον ἐμπόριον διοικεῖται.

## 15
Beyond Opone, the shore trending more toward the south, first there are the small and great bluffs of Azania; this coast is destitute of harbors, but there are places where ships can lie at anchor, the shore being abrupt; and this course is of six days, the direction being south-west. Then come the small and great beach for another six days' course and after that in order, the Courses of Azania, the first being called Sarapion and the next Nicon; and after that several rivers and other anchorages, one after the other, separately a rest and a run for each day, seven in all, until the Pyralaae islands and what is called the channel; beyond which, a little to the south of south-west, after two courses of a day and night along the Ausanitic coast, is the island Menuthias, about three hundred stadia from the main-land, low and wooded, in which there are rivers and many kinds of birds and the mountain-tortoise. There are no wild beasts except the crocodiles; but there they do not attack men. In this place there are sewed boats, and canoes hollowed from single logs, which they use for fishing and catching tortoise. In this island they also catch them in a peculiar way, in wicker baskets, which they fasten across the channel-opening between the breakers.

## 16
Two days' sail beyond, there lies the very last market-town of the continent of Azania, which is called Rhapta; which has its name from the sewed boats (rhaptôn ploiariôn) already mentioned; in which there is ivory in great quantity, and tortoise-shell. 

16 Ἀφʼ ἧς μετὰ δύο δρόμους τῆς ἠπείρου τὸ τελευταιότατον τῆς Ἀζανίας ἐμπόριον κεῖται, τὰ Ῥαπτὰ

271
λεγόμενα, ταύτην ἔχον τὴν προσωνυμίαν ἀπὸ τῶν προειρημένων ῥαπτῶν πλοιαρίων, ἐν ᾧ καὶ πλεῖστός ἐστιν ἐλέφας καὶ χελώνη. 

Along this coast live men of piratical habits, very great in stature, and under separate chiefs for each place. 

Μέγιστοι δὲ ἐν σώμασι περὶ ταύτην τὴν χώραν ἄνθρωποι ὁρατοὶ κατοικοῦσι καὶ κατὰ τόπον ἕκαστος ὁμοίως τιθέμενοι τυράννοις. 

The [Mapharitic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Hujariah) chief governs it under some ancient right that subjects it to the sovereignty of the state that is become first in Arabia. 

Νέμεται δὲ αὐτὴν, κατά τι δίκαιον ἀρχαῖον ὑποπίπτουσαν τῇ βασιλεία τῆς πρώτης γινομένης Ἀραβίας, ὁ Μοφαρείτης τύραννος. 

And the people of Muza now hold it under his authority, and send thither many large ships, using Arab captains and agents, who are familiar with the natives and intermarry with them, and who know the whole coast and understand the language.

Παρὰ δὲ τοῦ βασιλέως ὑπόφορον αὐτὴν ἔχουσιν οἱ ἀπὸ Μούζα, καὶ πέμπουσιν εἰς
αὐτὴν ἐφόλκια τὰ πλείονα κυβερνήταις καὶ χρειακοῖς Ἄραψι χρώμενοι τοῖς καὶ συνήθειαν καὶ ἐπιγαμβρίαν ἔχουσιν ἐμπείροις τε οὖσε τῶν τόπων καὶ τῆς φωνῆς αὐτὼν.
## 17
There are imported into these markets the lances made at Muza especially for this trade, and hatchets and daggers and awls, and various kinds of glass; and at some places a little wine, and wheat, not for trade, but to serve for getting the good-will of the savages. There are exported from these places a great quantity of ivory, but inferior to that of Adulis, and rhinoceros-horn and tortoise-shell (which is in best demand after that from India), and a little palm-oil.

17 Εἰσφέρεται δὲ εἰς τὰ ἐμπόρια ταῦτα προηγουμένως
ἡ τοπικῶς ἐν Μούζα κατασκευαζομένη λόγχη καὶ πελύκια καὶ μαχαίρια καὶ ὀπήτια καὶ λιθίας ὑαλῆς πλείονα γένη, εἰς δέ τινας τόπους οἶνός τε καὶ σῑτος οὐκ ὀλίγος, οὐ πρὸς ἐργασίαν ἀλλὰ δαπάνης χάριν εἰς φιλανθρωπίαν τῶν βαρβάρων. Ἐκφέρεται δὲ ἀπὸ

272
τῶν τόπων ἐλέφας πλεῖστος ἥσσων δὲ τοῦ Ἀθουλιτικοῦ καὶ ῥινόκερως καὶ χελώνη διάφορος μετὰ τὴν Ἰνδικὴν καὶ ναύπλιος ὀλίγος.

## 18
And these markets of Azania are the very last of the continent that stretches down on the right hand from Berenice; for beyond these places the unexplored ocean curves around toward the west, and running along by the regions to the south of Aethiopia and Libya and Africa, it mingles with the western sea.

## 19
Now to the left of Berenice, sailing for two or three days from Mussel Harbor eastward across the adjacent gulf, there is another harbor and fortified place, which is called White Village, from which there is a road to Petra, which is subject to Malichas, King of the Nabataeans. 

19 Ἐκ δὲ τῶν εὐωνύμων Βερνίκης ἀπὸ Μυὸς ὅρμου
δυσὶ δρόμοις ἢ τρισὶν εἰς τὴν ἀνατολὴν διαπλεύσαντι τὸν παρακείμενον κόλπον ὅρμος ἐστὶν ἕτερος καὶ φρούριον, ὃ λέγεται Λευκὴ κώμη, διʼ ἧς [ὁδός] ἐστιν
εἰς Πέτραν πρὸς Μάλιχον, βασιλέα Ναβαταίων. 

It holds the position of a market-town for the small vessels sent there from Arabia; 

Ἔχει

273
δὲ ἐμπορίου τινὰ καὶ αὐτὴ τάξιν τοῖς ἀπὸ τῆς Ἀραβίας ἐξαρτιζομένοις εἰς αὐτὴν πλοίοις οὐ μεγάλοις. 

and so a centurion is stationed there as a collector of one-fourth of the merchandise imported, with an armed force, as a garrison.

Διὸ καὶ εἰς αὐτήν καὶ παραλήπτης τῆς τετάρτης τῶν εἰσφερομένων φορτίων, καὶ παραφυλακῆς χάριν ἑκατοντάρχῆς
μετὰ στρατεύματος ἀποστέλλεται.

## 20
Directly below this place is the adjoining country of Arabia, in its length bordering a great distance on the Erythraean Sea. Different tribes inhabit the country, differing in their speech, some partially, and some altogether. 

20 Μετὰ δὲ ταύτην εὐθέως ἐστὶ συναφὴς Ἀραβικὴ χώρα, κατὰ μῆκος ἐπὶ πολὺ παρατείνουσα τῇ Ἐρυθρᾷ θαλάσσῃ. Διάφορα δὲ ἐν αὐτῇ ἔθνη κατοικεῖται, τινὰ μὲν ἐπὶ ποσὸν, τινὰ δὲ καὶ τελείως τῆ γλώσση διαλάσσοντα.

The land next the sea is similarly dotted here and there with caves of the Fish-Eaters, but the country inland is peopled by rascally men speaking two languages, who live in villages and nomadic camps, by whom those sailing off the middle course are plundered, and those surviving shipwrecks are taken for slaves. 

Τούτων τὰ παρὰ θάλασσαν ὁμοίως Ἰχθυοφάγων μάνδραις διείληπται, τὰ δὲ ἐπάνω κατὰ κώμας καὶ νομαδίας οἰκεῖται πονηροῖς ἀνθρώποις διφώνοις, οἷς παραπίπτοντες ἀπὸ τοῦ μέσου πλόου οἱ μὲν διαρπάζονται, οἱ δὲ καὶ ἀπὸ ναυαγίων σωθέντες ἀνδραποδίζονται.

And so they too are continually taken prisoners by the chiefs and kings of Arabia; and they are called Carnaites. 

Διὸ καὶ συνεχῶς ἀπὸ τῶν τυράννων καὶ βασιλέων τῆς Ἀραβίας αἰχμαλωτίζονται· λέγονται δὲ Κανρσῖται. 

Navigation is dangerous along this whole coast of Arabia, which is without harbors, with bad anchorages, foul, inaccessible because of breakers and rocks, and terrible in every way. 

Καθόλου μὲν οὖν οὗτος ὁ τῆς Ἀραβικῆς ἠπείρου παράπλους ἐστὶν ἐπισφαλὴς, καὶ ἀλίμενος ἡ χώρα καὶ δύσορμος καὶ ἀκάθαρτος ῥαχίαις καὶ σπίλοις
ἀπρόσιτος καὶ κατὰ πάντα φοβερά. 

Therefore we hold our course down the middle of the gulf and pass on as fast as possible by the country of Arabia until we come to the Burnt Island; directly below which there are regions of peaceful people, nomadic, pasturers of cattle, sheep and camels.

Διὸ καὶ εἰσπλέοντες τὸν μέσον πλοῦν κατέχομεν καὶ εἰς τὴν Ἀραβικήνχώραν μᾶλλον παροξύνομεν ἄχρι τῆς Κατακεκαυμένης νήσου, μεθʼ ἣν εὐθέως ἡμέρων ἀνθρώπων καὶ νομαδιαίων θρεμμάτων καὶ καμήλων συνεχεῖς [χῶραι].

## 21
Beyond these places, in a bay at the foot of the left side of this gulf, there is a place by the shore called Muza, a market-town established by law, distant altogether from Berenice for those sailing southward, about twelve thousand stadia. 

21 Καὶ μετὰ ταύτας ἐν κόλπῳ τῷ τελευταιοτάτῳ τῶν εὐωνύμων τούτου τοῦ πελάγους ἐμπόριόν ἐστι νόμιμον παραθαλάσσιον Μούζα, σταδίους ἀπέχον τοὺς πάντας ἀπὸ Βερνίκης, παῤ αὐτὸν τὸν νότον πλεόντων, 274 ὡς εἰς μυρίους δισχιλίους. 

And the whole place is crowded with Arab ship-owners and seafaring men, and is busy with the affairs of commerce; for they carry on a trade with the far-side coast and with Barygaza, sending their own ships there.

Τὸ μὲν ὅλον Ἀράβων ναυκληρικῶν ἐνθρώπων καὶ ναυτικῶν πλεονάζει καὶ τοῖς ἀπʼ ἐμπορίας πράγμασι κινεῖται· συγχρῶνται γὰρ τῇ τοῦ πέραν ἐργασίᾳ καὶ Βαρυγάζων ἰδίοις ἐξαρτισμοῖς.

## 22
Three days inland from this port there is a city called Saua, in the midst of the region called Mapharitis; and there is a vassal-chief named Cholaebus who lives in that city.

22 Ὑπέρκειται δὲ αὐτῆς ἀπὸ τριῶν ἡμερῶν πόλις Σαύη, τῆς περὶ αὐτὴν Μαφαρίτιδος λεγομένης χώρας· ἔστι δὲ τύραννος καὶ κατοικῶν αὐτὴν Χόλαιβος.

## 23
And after nine days more there is Saphar, the metropolis, in which lives Charibael, lawful king of two tribes, the Homerites and those living next to them, called the Sabaites; through continual embassies and gifts, he is a friend of the Emperors.

## 24
The market-town of Muza is without a harbor, but has a good roadstead and anchorage because of the sandy bottom thereabouts, where the anchors hold safely. 

24 Τὸ δὲ ἐμπόριον ἡ Μούζα ἀλίμενον μὲν εὔσαλον δὲ καὶ εὔορμον διὰ τὰ περὶ αὐτὴν ἀμμόγεια ἀγκυροβόλια.

The merchandise imported there consists of purple cloths, both fine and coarse; clothing in the Arabian style, with sleeves; plain, ordinary, embroidered, or interwoven with gold; saffron, sweet rush, muslins, cloaks, blankets (not many), some plain and others made in the local fashion; sashes of different colors, fragrant ointments in moderate quantity, wine and wheat, not much. 

Φορτία δὲ εἰς αὐτὴν προχωρεῖ πορφύρα, διάφορος καὶ

275
χυδαία, καὶ ἱματισμὸς Ἀραβικὸς χειριδωτὸς, ὅ τε ἁκλοῦς καὶ ὁ κοινὸς, καὶ σκοτουλάτος καὶ διάχρυσος, καὶ κρόκος καὶ κύπερος καὶ ὀθόνιον καὶ ἀβόλλαι καὶ λώδιικες οὐ πολλαὶ, ἁπλοῖ τε καὶ ἐντόπιοι, ζῶναι σκιωταὶ
καὶ μύρον μέτριον καὶ χρῆμα ἱκανὸν οἶνός τε καὶ σῖτος οὐ πολύς. 

For the country produces grain in moderate amount, and a great deal of wine. 

Φέρει γὰρ καὶ ἡ χώρα πυρὸν μετρίως καὶ οἶνον πλείονα. 

And to the King and the Chief are given horses and sumpter-mules, vessels of gold and polished silver, finely woven clothing and copper vessels. 


Τῷ δὲ βασιλεῖ καὶ τῷ τυράννῳ δίδονται ἵπποι τε καὶ ἡμίονοι νωτηγοὶ καὶ χρυσώματα καὶ τορνευτὰ ἀργυρώματα καὶ ἱματισμὸς πολυτελὴς
καὶ χαλκουργήματα. 

There are exported from the same place the things produced in the country: selected myrrh, and the Gebanite-Minaean stacte, alabaster and all the things already mentioned from Avalites and the far-side coast. 

Ἐξάγεται δὲ ἐξ αὐτῆς ἐντόπια μὲν, σμύρνα ἐκλεκτὴ καὶ στακτὴ * ἀβειρμιναία, λύγδος καὶ τὰ ἀπὸ τῆς πέραν Ἀδουλὶ προειρημένα φορτία πέντα. 

The voyage to this place is made best about the month of September, that is Thoth; but there is nothing to prevent it even earlier.

Πλεῖται δὲ εἰς αὐτὴν εὐκαίρως περὶ τὸν Σεπτέμβριον μῆνα, ὅς ἐστι Θώθ· οὐδὲν δὲ κωλύει κἂν
τάχιον.

## 25
After sailing beyond this place about three hundred stadia, the coast of Arabia and the Berber country about the Avalitic gulf now coming close together, there is a channel, not long in extent, which forces the sea together and shuts it into a narrow strait, the passage through which, sixty stadia in length, the island Diodorus divides. Therefore the course through it is beset with rushing currents and with strong winds blowing down from the adjacent ridge of mountains. Directly on this strait by the shore there is a village of Arabs, subject to the same chief, called Ocelis; which is not so much a market-town as it is an anchorage and watering-place and the first landing for those sailing into the gulf.

25 Μετὰ δὲ ταύτην ὡσεὶ τριακοσίους παραπλεύσαντες σταδίους, ἤδη συνερχομένης τε τῆς Ἀραβικῆς ἠπείρου καὶ τῆς πέραν κατὰ τὸν Aὐαλίτην Βαρβαρικῆς χώρας, αὐλών ἐστιν οὐ μακρὸς, ὁ συνάγων καὶ εἰς
στενὸν ἀποκλείων τὸ πέλαγος, οδ τὸν μεταξὺ πόρον ἑξήκοντα σταδίων μεσολαβεῖ νῆσος ἡ Διοδώρου· διὸ καὶ ῥοώδης, καταπνεόμενος ἀπὸ τῶν παρακειμένων ὀρῶν, ἐστὶν ὁ κατʼ αὐτὴν διάπλους. Κατὰ τοῦτον τὸν ἰσθμὸν παραθαλάσσιός ἐστιν Ἀράβων κώμη τῆς αὐτῆς τυραννίδος

276
Ὄκηλις, οὐχ οὕτως ἐμπόριον ὡς ὅρμος καὶ ὕδρευμα καὶ πρώτη καταγωγὴ τοῖς ἔσω διαίρουσι.

## 26
Beyond Ocelis, the sea widening again toward the east and soon giving a view of the open ocean, after about twelve hundred stadia there is Eudaemon Arabia, a village by the shore, also of the Kingdom of Charibael, and having convenient anchorages, and watering-places, sweeter and better than those at Ocelis; it lies at the entrance of a bay, and the land recedes from it. 

26 Μετὰ δὲ Ὄκηλιν, ἀνοιγομένης πάλιν τῆς θαλάσσης εἰς ἀνατολὴν καὶ κατὰ μικρὸν εἰς πέλαγος
ἀποφαινομένης, ἀπὸ σταδίων ὡς χιλίων διακοσίων ἐστὶν Εὐδαίμων Ἀραβία, κώμη παραθαλάσσιος, βασιλείας τῆς αὐτῆς Χαριβαὴλ, τοὺς ὅρμους μὲν ἐπιτηδείους

277
καὶ ὑδρεύματα γλυκύτερα [καὶ] κρείσσονα τῆς Ὀκήλεως ἔχουσα, ἤδη δὲ ἐν ἀρχῇ κόλπου κειμένη τῷ τὴν χώραν ὑποφεύγειν. 

It was called Eudaemon, because in the early days of the city when the voyage was not yet made from India to Egypt, and when they did not dare to sail from Egypt to the ports across this ocean, but all came together at this place, it received the cargoes from both countries, just as Alexandria now receives the things brought both from abroad and from Egypt. But not long before our own time Charibael destroyed the place.

Εὐδαίμων δʼ ἐπεκλήθη, πρότερον οὖσα πόλις, ὅτε, μήπω ἀπὸ τῆς Ἰνδικῆς εἰς τὴν Αἴγυπτον
ἐρχομένων μηδὲ ἀπὸ [τῆς] Αἰγύπτου τολμώντων εἰς τοὺς ἔσω τόπους διαίρειν, ἀλλʼ ἄχρι ταύτης παραγινομένων, τοὺς παῤ ἀμφοτέρων φόρτους ἀπεδέχετο, ὥσπερ Ἀλεξάνδρεια καὶ τῶν ἔξωθεν καὶ τῶν ἀπὸ τῆς Αἰγύπτου φερομένων ἀποδέχεται. Νῦν δὲ οὐ πρὸ
πολλοῦ τῶν ἡμετέρωνχρόνων Καῖσαρ αὐτὴν κατεστρέψατο.


## 27
After Eudaemon Arabia there is a continuous length of coast, and a bay extending two thousand stadia or more, along which there are Nomads and Fish-Eaters living in villages; just beyond the cape projecting from this bay there is another market-town by the shore, [Cana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bi%27r_Ali), of the Kingdom of [Eleazus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleazus), the Frankincense Country; and facing it there are two desert islands, one called Island of Birds, the other Dome Island, one hundred and twenty stadia from Cana. 

27 Ἀπὸ δὲ τῆς Εὐδαίμονος Ἀραβικῆς ἐκδέχεται συναφὴς αἰγιαλὸς ἐπιμήκης καὶ κόλπος ἐπὶ δισχιλίους ἢ πλείονας παρήκων σταδίους, Νομάδων τε καὶ Ἰχθυοφάγων
κώμαις παροικούμενος, οὗ μετὰ τὴν προέχουσαν ἄκραν ἐμπόριόν ἐστιν ἕτερον παραθαλάσσιον, Κανὴ, βασιλείας Ἐλεάζου, χώρας λιβανωτοφόρου,

278
καὶ κατʼ αὐτὴν ἔρημοι νῆσοι δύο, μία μὲν ἡ τῶν Ὀρνέων, ἡ δʼ ἑτέρα λεγομένη Τρούλλας, ἀπὸ σταδίων ἑκατὸν εἴκοσι τῆς Κανῆς. 

Inland from this place lies the metropolis [Sabbatha](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabwa), in which the King lives. 

Ὑπέρκειται δὲ αὐτῆς μεσόγειος ἡ μητρόπολις Σαββαθὰ, ἐν ᾗ καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς
κατοικεῖ. 

All the frankincense produced in the country is brought by camels to that place to be stored, and to Cana on rafts held up by inflated skins after the manner of the country, and in boats. 

Πᾶς δὲ ὁ γεννώμενος ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ λίβανος εἰς αὐτὴν ὥσπερ ἐκδοχεῖον εἰσάγεται καμήλοις τε καὶ σχεδίαις ἐντοπίοις δερματίναις ἐξ ἀσκῶν καὶ πλοίοις.

And this place has a trade also with the far-side ports, with Barygaza and Scythia and Ommana and the neighboring coast of Persia.

279
Ἔχει δὲ καὶ αὐτὴ σύγχρησιν τῶν τοῦ πέραν ἐμπορίων, Βαρυγάζων καὶ Σκυθίας καὶ Ὀμάνων καὶ τῆς παρακειμένης Περσίδος.
## 28
There are imported into this place from Egypt a little wheat and wine, as at Muza; clothing in the Arabian style, plain and common and most of it spurious; and copper and tin and coral and storax and other things such as go to Muza; and for the King usually wrought gold and silver plate, also horses, images, and thin clothing of fine quality. 

28 Εἰσάγεται δὲ εἰς αὐτὴν ἀπʼ Αἰγύπτου μὲν ὁμοίως
πυρὸς ὀλίγος καὶ οἶνος ὥσπερ καὶ εἰς Μούζα, καὶ ἱματισμὸς Ἀραβικὸς, ὁμοίως καὶ κοινὸς καὶ ἀπλοῦς καὶ ὁ νόθος περισσότερος, καὶ χαλκὸς καὶ κασσίτερος καὶ κοράλλιον καὶ στύραξ καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ ὅσα εἰς Μούζα· τὰ πλείονα δὲ ἀργυρώματα τετορευμένα καὶ χρήματα
τῷ βασιλεῖ, [καὶ] ἵπποι δὲ καὶ ἀνδριάντες καὶ ἱματισμὸς διάφορος ἀπλοῦς. 

And there are exported from this place, native produce, frankincense and aloes, and the rest of the things that enter into the trade of the other ports. The voyage to this place is best made at the same time as that to Muza, or rather earlier.

Ἐξάγεται δὲ ἐξ αὐτῆς ἐντόπια μὲν φορτία, λίβανος καὶ ἀλόη, τὰ δὲ λοιπὰ κατὰ μετοχὴν τῶν ἄλλων ἐμπορίων. Πλεῖται δὲ εἰς αὐτὴν περὶ τὸν αὐτὸν καιρὸν ὃν καὶ εἰς Μούζα, πρωῖμώτερον δέ.

## 29
Beyond Cana, the land receding greatly, there follows a very deep bay stretching a great way across, which is called Sachalites; and the Frankincense Country, mountainous and forbidding, wrapped in thick clouds and fog, and yielding frankincense from the trees. 

29 Μετὰ δὲ Κανὴν, τῆς γῆς ἐπὶ πλεῖον ὑποχωρούσης, ἄλλος ἐκδέχεται βαθύτατος κόλπος, ἐπὶ πολὺ παρεκτείνων, ὁ λεγόμενος Σαχαλίτης, καὶ χώρα λιβανωτοφόρος,

280
ὀρεινή τε καὶ δύσβατος, ἀέρα παχὺν ἔχουσα καὶ ὁμιχλώδη [καὶ] κατὰ τῶν δένδρων φερόμενον τὸν λίβανον. 

These incense-bearing trees are not of great height or thickness; they bear the frankincense sticking in drops on the bark, just as the trees among us in Egypt weep their gum. 

Ἔστι δὲ τὰ δένδρα τὰ λιβανοφόρα οὐ μεγάλα λίαν οὐδὲ ὑψηλὰ, φέρει δὲ ἐπὶ τῷ φλοιῷ πησσόμενον
τὸν λίβανον, ὥς τινα καὶ τῶν παῤ ἡμῖν ἐν Aἰγύπτῳ δένδρων δακρύει τὸ κόμμι. 

The frankincense is gathered by the King's slaves and those who are sent to this service for punishment. 

Μεταχειρίζεται δ ὁ λίβανος ὑπὸ δούλων βασιλικῶν καὶ τῶν ἐπὶ τιμωρίᾳ πεμπομένον. 

For these places are very unhealthy, and pestilential even to those sailing along the coast, but almost always fatal to those working there, who also perish often from want of food.

Ἐπίνοσοι δὲ δεινῶς οἱ τόποι, καὶ τοῖς μὲν παραπλέουσι λοιμικοὶ, τοῖς δὲ ἐργαζομένοις πάντοτε
θανατώδεις, ἔτι δὲ καὶ διὰ τὴν ἔνδειαν τῆς τροφῆς εὐχερῶς ἀπολλυμένοις.

## 30
On this bay there is a very great promontory facing the east, called Syagrus; on which is a fort for the defense of the country, and a harbor and storehouse for the frankincense that is collected; and opposite this cape, well out at sea, there is an island, lying between it and the Cape of Spices opposite, but nearer Syagrus: it is called [Dioscorida](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socotra), and is very large but desert and marshy, having rivers in it and crocodiles and many snakes and great lizards, of which the flesh is eaten and the fat melted and used instead of olive oil. The island yields no fruit, neither vine nor grain. 

30 Τούτου δʼ ἐστὶν ἀκρωτήριον τοῦ κόσμου μέγιστον, ἀποβλέπον εἰς ἀνατολὴν, ὁ καλούμενος Σύαγρος, ἐφ’ οἷ φρούριόν ἐστι τῆς χώρας καὶ λιμήν καὶ ἀποθήκη
τοῦ συναγομένου λιβάνου· καὶ κατὰ τοῦτον ἐν τῷ πελάγει νῆσος, ἀνὰ μέσον τούτου καὶ τοῦ πέραν ἀκρωτηρίου τῶν Ἀρωμάτων, τῷ Συάγρῳ συνορίζουσα μᾶλλον, ἡ Διοσκορίδου καλουμένη, μεγίστη μὲν ἔρημος δὲ

281
καὶ κάθυγρος, ἔχουσα ποταμοὺς ἐν αὑτῇ καὶ κροκοδείλους καὶ ἐχίδνας πλείστας καὶ σαύρας ὑπερμεγέθεις, ὧν τὸ κρέας ἐσθίουσι τὸ δὲ λίπος τήκουσι καὶ ἀντʼ ἐλαίου χρῶνται· καρπὸν δὲ οὔτε ἀμπέλου οὔτε σιτικὸν ἡ νῆσος φέρει. 

The inhabitants are few and they live on the coast toward the north, which from this side faces the continent. They are foreigners, a mixture of Arabs and Indians and Greeks, who have emigrated to carry on trade there. 

Οἱ δʼ ἐνοικοῦντες αὐτὴν ὀλίγοι κατὰ μίαν πλευρὰν τῆς νήσου τὴν πρὸς ἀπαρκτίαν οἰκοῦσι, καθʼ ὃ μέρος ἀποβλέπει τὴν ἤπειρον· εἶσὶ δὲ ἐπίξενοι καὶ ἐπίμικτοι Ἀράβων τε καὶ Ἰνδῶν καὶ ἔτι Ἐλλήνων τῶν πρὸς ἐργασίαν ἐκπλεόντων. 

The island produces the true sea-tortoise, and the land-tortoise, and the white tortoise which is very numerous and preferred for its large shells; and the mountain-tortoise, which is largest of all and has the thickest shell; of which the worthless specimens cannot be cut apart on the under side, because they are even too hard; but those of value are cut apart and the shells made whole into caskets and small plates and cake-dishes and that sort of ware. 

Φέρει δὲ ἡ νῆσος χελώνην τήν
τε ἀληθινὴν καὶ χερσαίαν καὶ τὴν λευκὴν, πλείστην τε καὶ διάφορον τοῖς ὀστράκοις μείζοσι, τήν τε ὀρεινὴν ὑπερμεγέθη καὶ παχύτατον ὄστρακον ἔχουσαν, οὗ τὰ παρὰ τὴν κοιλίαν μέρη μὲν τομὴν οὐκ ἐπιδέχεται, καίπερ στερρότερα ὄντα· ὁλοτελῶς δὲ τὰ εὐχρηστοῦντα
εἰς γλωσσόκομα καὶ πινακίδια καὶ μαγίδια καὶ τοιαύτην τινὰ γρύτην κατατέμνεται. 

There is also produced in this island cinnabar, that called Indian, which is collected in drops from the trees.

Γίνεται δὲ ἐν αὐτῇ καὶ κιννάβαρι τὸ λεγόμενον Ἰνδικὸν, ἀπὸ τῶν δένδρῶν ὡς δάκρυ συναγόμενον.

## 31
It happens that just as Azania is subject to Charibael and the Chief of Mapharitis, this island is subject to the King of the Frankincense Country. 

31 Ὑποπίπτει μὲν οὖν, ὥςπερ ἡ Ἀζανία Χαριβαῆλι
καὶ τῷ Μαφαρείτῃ τυράννῳ, καὶ ἡ νῆσος αὐτῷ τῷ βασιλεῖ τῆς λιβανωτοφόρου. 

Trade is also carried on there by some people from Muza and by those who chance to call there on the voyage from [Damirica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limyrike) and Barygaza; they bring in rice and wheat and Indian cloth, and a few female slaves; and they take for their exchange cargoes, a great quantity of tortoise-shell. Now the island is farmed out under the Kings and is garrisoned.

Συνεχρήσαντο δὲ αὐτῇ καὶ ἀπὸ Μούζα τινὲς καὶ τῶν ἐκπλεόντων ἀπὸ Aιμυρικῆς καὶ Βαρυγάζων ὅσοι κατὰ τύχην εἰς αὐτὴν ἐπιβάλλοντες ὄρυζάν τε καὶ σῖτον καὶ ὀθόνην Ἰνδικὴν

282
ἀντικαταλλασσόμενοι καὶ σώματα θηλυκὰ διὰ σπάνιν ἐκεῖ προχωροῦντα, χελώνην ἀντεφορτίζοντο πλείστην· νῦν δὲ ὑπὸ τῶν βασιλέων ἡ νῆσος ἐκμεμίσθωται καὶ παραφυλάσσεται.

## 32
Immediately beyond Syagrus the bay of Omana cuts deep into the coast-line, the width of it being six hundred stadia; and beyond this there are mountains, high and rocky and steep, inhabited by cave-dwellers for five hundred stadia more; and beyond this is a port established for receiving the Sachalitic frankincense; the harbor is called [Moscha](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscat#:~:text=moscha), and ships from Cana call there regularly; and ships returning from Damirica and Barygaza, if the season is late, winter there, and trade with the King's officers, exchanging their cloth and wheat and sesame oil for frankincense, which lies in heaps all over the Sachalitic country, open and unguarded, as if the place were under the protection of the gods; for neither openly nor by stealth can it be loaded on board ship without the King's permission; if a single grain were loaded without this, the ship could not clear from the harbor.

32 Μετὰ δὲ τὸν Σύαγρον κόλπος ἐστὶ συναφὴς ἐπὶ βάθος ἐνδύνων εἰς τὴν ἤπειρον, Ὄμανα, σταδίους ἔχων ἑξακοσίους τὸ διαπέραμα, καὶ μετʼ αὐτὸν ὑψηλὰ ὄρη πετρώδη καὶ ἀπόκοπα ἀνθρώπων ἐν σπηλαίοις κατοικούντων, ἐπὶ σταδίους ἄλλους πεντακοσίους, καὶ μετʼ
αὐτοὺς ὅρμος ἀποδεδειγμένος τοῦ Σαχαλίτου λιβάνου πρὸς ἐμβολὴν, Μόσχα λιμὴν λεγόμενος, εἰς ἣν ἀπὸ Κανῆς συνήθως πλοῖα πέμπεταί τινα, καὶ παραπλέοντα ἀπὸ Λιμυρικῆς ἢ Bαρυγάζων ὀψινοῖς καιροῖς παραχειμάσαντα παρὰ τῶν βασιλικῶν πρὸς ὀθόνιον καὶ σῑτον
καὶ ἔλαιον λίβανον ἀντιφορτίζουσι παῤ ὅλον τὸν Σαχαλίτην χώμασι κείμενον καὶ ἀφύλακτον, δυνάμει θεῶν τινὶ τοῦτον τὸν τόπον ἐπιτηρούντων· οὔτε γὰρ λάθρα οὔτε φανερῶς χωρὶς βασιλικῆς δώσεως εἰς πλοῖον ἐμβληθῆναι δύναται· κἂν χόνδρον τις ἄρῃ, οὐ δύναται
πλεῦσαι τὸ πλοῖον ἀπὸ [τοῦ] λιμένος.

## 33
Beyond the harbor of Moscha for about fifteen hundred stadia as far as Asich, a mountain range runs along the shore; at the end of which, in a row, lie seven islands, called Zenobian. Beyond these there is a barbarous region which is no longer of the same Kingdom, but now belongs to Persia. Sailing along this coast well out at sea for two thousand stadia from the Zenobian Islands, there meets you an island called Sarapis, about one hundred and twenty stadia from the mainland. 

33 [Ἀπὸ δὲ Μόσχα] λιμένος ἐπʼ ἄλλους σταδίους ὡς χιλίους πεντακοσίους ἕως Ἀσὶχ ὄρος τῇ γῇ παρατείνει, καὶ κατὰ τὸ ἀπολῆγον αὐτοῦ μέρος ἑπτὰ νῆσοι πρόκεινται κατὰ τὸ ἑξῆς, αἱ Ζηνοβίου λεγόμεναι,
μεθʼ ὃς ἄλλη παράκειται χώρα βάρβαρος οὐκ ἔτι τῆς αὐτῆς βασιλείας, ἀλλʼ ἤδη τῆς Περσίδος, ἣν ἀφʼ ὕψους παραπλέοντι ὡς σταδίους δισχιλίους ἀπὸ τῶν Ζηνοβίου συναντᾷ νῆσος Σαράπιδος λεγομένη, ἀπὸ σταδίων τῆς γῆς ὡσεὶ ἑκατὸν εἴκοσι. 

It is about two hundred stadia wide and six hundred long, inhabited by three settlements of Fish-Eaters, a villainous lot, who use the Arabian language and wear girdles of palm-leaves. 

Ταύτης τὸ μὲν πλάτος ἐστὶν
ὡσεὶ σταδίων διακοσίων, τὸ δὲ μῆκος ἑξακοσίων, οἰκεῖται δὲ κώμαις τρισὶ καὶ ἀνθρώποις ἱεροῖς Ἰχθυοφάγων· γλώσση δὲ Ἀραβικῇ χρῶνται καὶ περιζώμασι φύλλων κουκίνων. 

The island produces considerable tortoise-shell of fine quality, and small sail-boats and cargo-ships are sent there regularly from Cana.

Ἔχει δὲ ἡ νῆσος χελώνην ἱκανὴν καὶ διάφορον· ἐξαρτίζοωσι δὲ εἰς αὐτὴν συνήθως οἱ ἀπὸ Κανῆς σκάφας καὶ ἐφόλκια.

## 34
Sailing along the coast, which trends northward toward the entrance of the Persian Sea, there are many islands known as the Calaei, after about two thousand stadia, extending along the shore. The inhabitants are a treacherous lot, very little civilized.

## 35
At the upper end of these Calaei islands is a range of mountains called Calon, and there follows not far beyond, the mouth of the Persian Gulf, where there is much diving for the pearl-mussel. 

35 Περὶ δὲ τὴν ἐσχάτην κεφαλήν τῶν Καλαίου νήσων καὶ τὸ λεγόμενον Καλὸν ὄρος ἐκδέχεται μετʼ οὐ πολὺ τὸ στόμα τῆς Περσικῆς, καὶ πλεῖσται κολυμβήσεις εἰσὶ τοῦ πινικίου κόγχου. 

To the left of the straits are great mountains called Asabon, and to the right there rises in full view another round and high mountain called Semiramis; between them the passage across the strait is about six hundred stadia; beyond which that very great and broad sea, the Persian Gulf, reaches far into the interior. At the upper end of this Gulf there is a market-town designated by law, called [Apologus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ubulla), situated near [Charax Spasini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charax_Spasinu) and the River Euphrates.

Τούτου δὲ τοῦ στόματος ἐκ
τῶν εὐωνύμων ἐστὶν ὄρη μέγιστα λεγόμενα Ἀσαβῶν, ἐκ δὲ τῶν δεξιῶν ἄντικρυς ἀφορώμενον ἄλλο στρογγύλον ὑψηλὸν, τὸ Σεμιράμεως λεγόμενον, καὶ μέσος αὐτὸς ὁ διάπλους τοῦ στόματος ὡς σταδίους ἑξακοσίους, διʼ οὗ μέγιστος καὶ πλατύτατος εἰς τοὺς ἐσωτάτους τόπους
ὁ Περσικὸς κόλπος ἀναχεῖται, καθʼ ὃν ἐν τοῖς ἐσχάτοις αὐτοῦ μέρεσιν ἐμπόριόν ἐστι νόμιμον, λεγόμενον

285
ἡ Ἀπολόγου, κειμένη κατὰ Πασίνου Χάρακα καὶ ποτάμον Εὐφράτην.

## 36
Sailing through the mouth of the Gulf, after a six-days’ course there is another market-town of Persia called Ommana. 

36 Παραπλεύσαντι δὲ τοῦτο τὸ στόμα τοῦ κόλπου μετὰ δρόμους ἓξ ἕτερον ἐμπόριόν ἐστι τῆς Περσίδος, τὰ
λεγόμενα Ὄμανα. 

To both of these market-towns large vessels are regularly sent from Barygaza, loaded with copper and sandalwood and timbers of teakwood and logs of blackwood and ebony. To Ommana frankincense is also brought from Cana, and from Ommana to Arabia boats sewed together after the fashion of the place; these are known as madarata. 

Ἐξαρτίζεται δὲ εἰς αὐτὴν συνήθως, ἀπὸ μὲν Βαρυγάζων εἰς ἀμφότερα ταῦτα τῆς Περσίδος ἐμπόρια πλοῖα μεγάλα χαλκοῦ καὶ ξύλων σανταλίνων καὶ δοκῶν καὶ κεράτων καὶ φαλάγγων σασαμίνων καὶ ἐβενίνων, εἰς δὲ τὰ Ὄμανα καὶ ἀπὸ
Κανῆς λίβανος, καὶ ἀπ’ Ὀμάνων εἰς τὴν Ἀραβίαν ἐντόπια ῥαπτὰ πλοιάρια, τὰ λεγόμενα μαδάρα. 

From each of these market-towns, there are exported to Barygaza and also to Arabia, many pearls, but inferior to those of India; purple, clothing after the fashion of the place, wine, a great quantity of dates, gold and slaves.

Εἰσφέρεται δὲ ἀπὸ ἑκατέρων τῶν ἐμπορίων εἴς τε Βαρύγαζα καὶ εἰς Ἀραβίαν πινικὸν, πολὺ μὲν, χεῖρον δὲ

286
τοῦ Ἰνδικοῦ, καὶ πορφύρα καὶ ἱματισμὸς ἐντόπιος καὶ οἶνος καὶ φοῖνιξ πολὺς καὶ χρυσὸς καὶ σώματα.

## 37
Beyond the Ommanitic region there is a country also of the Parsidae, of another Kingdom, and the bay of Gedrosia, from the middle of which a cape juts out out into the bay. Here there is a river affording an entrance for ships, with a little market-town at the mouth, called Oraea; and back from the place an in-land city, distant a seven days' journey from the sea, in which also is the King's court; it is called ⸻ (probably Rhambacia). This country yields much wheat, wine, rice and dates; but along the coast there is nothing but bdellium.

37 Μετὰ δὲ τὴν Ὀμανιτικὴν χώραν ὁμοίως ἡ Παρσιδῶν παράκειται, βασιλείας ἑτέρας, καὶ κόλπος
τῶν Τεράβδων λεγόμενος, οὗ κατὰ μέσον εἰς τὸν κόλπον [ἄκρα] παρανατείνει. Καὶ παῤ αὐτὸν ποταμός ἐστιν, ἔχων εἰσαγωγὴν πλοίοις, καὶ μικρὸν ἐπὶ τοῦ στόματος ἔμεπόριον Ὠραία λεγόμενον, καὶ κατὰ νώτου μεσόγειος πόλις, [ἀπ] έχουσα ὁδὸν ἡμερῶν ἑπτὰ ἀπὸ
θαλάσσης, ἐν ᾗ καὶ βασιλεία ἡ λεγομένη ⋯. Φέρει δὲ ἡ χώρα σῖτον πολὺ καὶ οἶνον καὶ ὄρυζαν καὶ φοίνικα, πρὸς δὲ τὴν ἤπειρον οὐδὲν ἕτερον ἢ βδέλλαν.

## 38
Beyond this region, the continent making a wide curve from the east across the depths of the bays, there follows the coast district of Scythia, which lies above toward the north; the whole marshy; from which flows down the river Sinthus, the greatest of all the rivers that flow into the Erythraean Sea, bringing down an enormous volume of water; so that a long way out at sea, before reaching this country, the water of the ocean is fresh from it. 

38 Μετὰ δὲ ταύτην τὴν χώραν, ἤδη τῆς ἠπείρου διὰ τὸ βάθος τῶν κόλπων ἐκ τῆς ἀνατολῆς ὑπερκερώεης,
ἐκδέχεται [τὰ] παραθαλάσσια μέρη τῆς Σκυθίας παῤ αὐτὸν κειμένης τὸν βορέαν, ταπεινὰ λίαν, ἐξ ὧν ποταμὸς Σίνθος, μέγιστος τῶν κατὰ τὴν Ἐρυθρὰν θάλασσαν ποταμῶν καὶ πλεῖστον ὕδωρ εἰς θάλασσαν ἐκβάλλων, ὥστε ἄχρι πολλοῦ καὶ πρὶν ἢ συμβάλῃ τῆ χώρᾳ εἰς

287
τὸ πέλαγος ἀπαντᾶν ἀπʼ αὐτοῦ λευκὸν ὕδωρ. 

Now as a sign of approach to this country to those coming from the sea, there are serpents coming forth from the depths to meet you; and a sign of the places just mentioned and in Persia, are those called graea. 

Σημεῖον δὲ ἤδη τῆς περὶ αὐτὴν [τὴν] χώραν ἐπιβολῆς τοῖς ἐκ πελάγους ἐρχομένοις οἱ προαπαντῶντες ὄφεις ἐκ τοῦ βάθους τῶν γὰρ ἐπάνω καὶ περὶ τὴν Περσίδα τόπων
σημεῖόν ἐστιν αἱ λεγόμεναι γράαι. 

This river has seven mouths, very shallow and marshy, so that they are not navigable, except the one in the middle; at which by the shore, is the market-town, Barbaricum. 

Ἑπτὰ δὲ οὗτος ὁ ποταμὸς ἔχει στόματα, λεπτὰ δὲ ταῦτα καὶ τεναγώδη, καὶ τὰ μὲν ἄλλα διάπλουν οὐκ ἔχει, μόνον δὲ τὸ μέσον, ἐφʼ οὗ καὶ παραθαλάσσιον ἐμπόριόν ἐστιν Βαρβαρικόν. 

Before it there lies a small island, and inland behind it is the metropolis of Scythia, Minnagara; it is subject to Parthian princes who are constantly driving each other out.

Πρόκειται δὲ αὐτοῦ νησίον μικρὸν, καὶ κατὰ νώτου
μεσόγειος ἡ μητρόπολις αὐτῆς τῆς Σκωθίας Μινναγάρ· βασιλεύεται δὲ ὑπὸ Πάρθων, συνεχῶς ἀλλήλους ἐνδιωκόντων.

## 39
The ships lie at anchor at Barbaricum, but all their cargoes are carried up to the metropolis by the river, to the King. 

39 Τὰ μὲν οὖν πλοῖα κατὰ τὴν Βαρβαρικὴν διορμίρεται
διὰ τοῦ ποταμοῦ τῷ βασιλεῖ. 

There are imported into this market a great deal of thin clothing, and a little spurious; figured linens, topaz, coral, storax, frankincense, vessels of glass, silver and gold plate, and a little wine. 

Προχωρεῖ δὲ εἰς τὸ ἐμπόριον ἱματισμὸς ἁπλοῦς ἱκανὸς καὶ νόθος οὐ πολὺς, πολύμιτα καὶ χρυσόλιθον καὶ κοράλλιον καὶ στύραξ καὶ λίβανος καὶ ὑαλὰ σκεύη καὶ ἀργυρώματα καὶ χρῆμα, οἶνος δ οὐ πολύς. 

On the other hand there are exported costus, bdellium, lycium, nard, turquoise, lapis lazuli, Seric skins, cotton cloth, silk yarn, and indigo. 

Ἀντιφορτίζεται δὲ κόστος, βδέλλα,

288
λύκιον, νάρδος καὶ καλλεανὸς λίθος καὶ σάπφειρος καὶ Σηρικὰ δέρματα καὶ ὀθόνιον καὶ νῆμα Σηρικὸν καὶ Ἰνδικὸν μέλαν. 

And sailors set out thither with the Indian Etesian winds, about the month of July, that is Epiphi: it is more dangerous then, but through these winds the voyage is more direct, and sooner completed.

Ἀνάγονται δὲ καὶ αὐτοὶ οἱ πλέοντες μετὰ τῶν Ἰνδκῶν ⋯περὶ τὸν Ἰούλιον μῆνα, ὅς ἐστιν
Ἐπιφί· δυςεπίβολος μὲν, ἐπιφορώτερος δὲ ἐκείνων καὶ συντομώτερος ὁ πλοῦς.


## 40
Beyond the river Sinthus there is another gulf, not navigable, running in toward the north; it is called Eirinon; its parts are called separately the small gulf and the great; in both parts the water is shallow, with shifting sandbanks occurring continually and a great way from shore; so that very often when the shore is not even in sight, ships run aground, and if they attempt to hold their course they are wrecked. 

40 Μετὰ δὲ τὸν Σίνθον ποταμὸν ἕτερός ἐστι κόλπος ἀθεώρητος παρὰ τὸν βορέαν· ὀνομάζεται δὲ Εἰρινὸν, ἐπιλέγεται δὲ ὁ μὲν μικρὸν ὁ δὲ μέγα· πελάγη δέ
ἐστιν ἀμφότερα τεναγώδη καὶ δίνας ἐλαφρὰς ἔχοντα καὶ συνεχεῖς καὶ μακρὰς ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς, ὡς πολλάκις, τῆς ἠπείρου μηδὲ βλεπομένης, ἐποκέλλειν τὰ πλοῖα, ἐνδοτέρω δὲ προληφθέντα καὶ ἀπόλλυσθαι. 

A promontory stands out from this gulf, curving around from Eirinon toward the East, then South, then West, and enclosing the gulf called [Baraca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarka) (dvaraka), which contains seven islands. Those who come to the entrance of this bay escape it by putting about a little and standing further out to sea; but those who are drawn inside into the gulf of Baraca are lost; for the waves are high and very violent, and the sea is tumultuous and foul, and has eddies and rushing whirlpools. 

Τούτου δὲ ὑπερέχει τοῦ κόλπου ἀκρωτήριον, ἐπικαμπὲς ἀπὸ τοῦ Εἰρίνου μετὰ τὴν ἀνατολὴν καὶ τὸν νότον ὡς εἰς τὴν 289 δύσιν, ἐμπεριλαμβάνον αὐτὸν τὸν κόλπον λεγόμενον Βαράκην, νήσους ἑπτὰ ἐμπεριειλημμένον, οὗ περὶ μὲν τὰς ἀρχὰς οἱ περιπεσόντες ὀλίγον ὀπίσω καὶ εἰς τὸ πέλαγος ἀναδραμόντες ἐκφεύγουσιν, οἱ δὲ εἰς αὐτὴν κατακλεισθέντες τὴν τοῦ Βαράκου κοιλίαν ἀπόλλυνται τὸ μὲν γὰρ κῦμα μέγα καὶ βαρὺ λίαν, ἡ δὲ θάλασσα ταραχώδης καὶ θολερὰ καὶ δίνας ἔχουσα καὶ ῥοώδεις εἰλίγγους. 

The bottom is in some places abrupt, and in others rocky and sharp, so that the anchors lying there are parted, some being quickly cut off, and others chafing on the bottom. 

Ὁ δὲ βυθὸς ἔν τισι μὲν ἀπόκοπος ἔν τισι δὲ πετρώδης καὶ ἀπόξυρος, ὥστε τέμνεσθαι τὰς παρακειμένας
ἀγκύρας διὰ ταχέων ἀποκοπτομένας, ἃς δὲ καὶ συντριβομένας ἐν τῷ βυθῷ. 

As a sign of these places to those approaching from the sea there are serpents, very large and black; for at the other places on this coast and around Barygaza, they are smaller, and in color bright green, running into gold.

Σημεῖον δʼ αὐτῶν τοῖς ἀπὸ πελάγους ἐρχομένοις οἱ προαπαντῶντες ὄφεις ὑπερμεγέθεις καὶ μέλανες ἐν γὰρ τοῖς μετὰ ταῦτα τόποις καὶ τοῖς περὶ Βαρύγαζα μικρότεροι καὶ τῷ χρώματι
χλωροὶ καὶ χρυσίζοντες ὑπαντῶσιν.

## 41
Beyond the gulf of Baraca is that of [Barygaza](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharuch#:~:text=Barygaza) and the coast of the country of Ariaca, which is the beginning of the Kingdom of [Nambanus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahapana) and of all India. 

41 Μετὰ δὲ τὸν Βαράκην εὐθύς ἐστιν ὁ Βαρυγάζων κόλπος καὶ ἡ ἤπειρος τῆς Ἀριακῆς χώρας, τῆς Μαμβάρου βασιλείας ἀρχὴ καὶ τῆς ὅλης Ἰνδικῆς οὖσα. 

That part of it lying inland and adjoining Scythia is called [Abiria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiria), but the coast is called [Syrastrene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrastrene). 

Ταύτης τὰ μὲν μεσόγεια τῇ Σκυθίᾳ συνορίζοντα Ἀβηρία

290
καλεῖται, τὰ δὲ παραθαλάσσια Συραστρηνή. 

It is a fertile country, yielding wheat and rice and sesame oil and clarified butter, cotton and the Indian cloths made therefrom, of the coarser sorts. Very many cattle are pastured there, and the men are of great stature and black in color. 

Πολυφόρος δὲ ἡ χώρα σίτου καὶ ὀρύζης καὶ ἐλαίου σησαμίνου καὶ βουτύρου καὶ καρπάσου καὶ τῶν ἐξ αὐτῆς Ἰνδικῶν ὀθονίων τῶν χυδαίων· βουκόλια δὲ ἐν αὐτῇ πλεῖστα
καὶ ἄνδρες ὑπερμεγέθεις τῷ σώματι καὶ μέλανες τῇ χροιᾷ. 

The metropolis of this country is Minnagara, from which much cotton cloth is brought down to Barygaza. 

Μητρόπολις δὲ τῆς χώρας Μιννάγαρα, ἀφʼ ἧς καὶ πλεῖστον ὀθόνιον εἰς Βαρύγαζα κατάγεται. 

In these places there remain even to the present time signs of the expedition of Alexander, such as ancient shrines, walls of forts and great wells. 

Σώζεται δὲ ἔτι καὶ νῦν τῆς Ἀλεξάνδρου στρατιᾶς σημεῖα περὶ τοὺς τόπους, ἱερά τε ἀρχαῖα καὶ θεμέλιοι παρεμβολῶν
καὶ φρέατα μέγιστα. 

The sailing course along this coast, from Barbaricum to the promontory called Papica, opposite Barygaza, and before Astacampra, is of three thousand stadia.

Ὁ δὲ παράπλους ταύτης τῆς χώρας ἀπὸ τοῦ Βαρβαρικοῦ μέχρι τοῦ κατὰ Ἀστάκαπρα πέραν βαρυγάζων ἀκρωτηρίου, τῆς λεγομένης Παπικῆς, ἐστὶ σταδίων τριτχιλίων.

## 42
Beyond this there is another gulf exposed to the sea-waves, running up toward the north, at the mouth of which there is an island called Baeones: at its innermost part there is a great river called [Mais](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahi_River). Those sailing to Barygaza pass across this gulf, which is three hundred stadia in width, leaving behind to their left the island just visible from their tops toward the east, straight to the very mouth of the river of Barygaza; and this river is called [Nammadus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narmada_River).

42 Μεθʼ ἡς ἕτερός ἐστι κόλπος, ἔσω κυμάτων, εἰς
αὐτὸν ἐνδύνων τὸν βορέαν, οὗ κατὰ μὲν τὸ στόμα νῆσός ἐστιν ἡ λεγομένη Bαιώνης, ἐν δὲ τοῖς ἐσωτάτοις τόποις μέγιστος ποταμὸς ὁ λεγόμενος Μάϊς. Τοῦτον

291
τὸν κόλπον, τὸ πλάτος ὡς σταδίων τριακοσίων, οἱ πλέοντες εἰς Bαρύγαζα διαπερῶνται, ἐξ εὐωνύμων ἀκροφανῆ καταλιπόντες τὴν νῆσον, καὶ εἰς αὐτὴν [τὴν] ἀνατολὴν ἐπʼ αὐτὸ τὸ στόμα τοῦ ποταμοῦ Βαρυγάζων·
λέγεται δὲ αὐτὸς ὁ ποταμὸς Ναμνάδιος.

## 43
This gulf is very narrow to Barygaza and very hard to navigate for those coming from the ocean; this is the case with both the right and left passages, but there is a better passage through the left. 

43 Ὁ δὲ κόλπος αὐτὸς ὁ κατὰ Βαρύγαζα στενὸς ὢν τοῖς ἐκ πελάγους ἐρχομένοις ἐστὶ δυσεπίβολος· ἢ γὰρ εἰς τὰ δεξιὰ ἢ εἰς τὰ εὐώνυμα παραπίπτουσιν, ᾗ γε ἐπιβολὴ κρείσσων ἐστὶ τῆς ἑτέρας. 

For on the right at the very mouth of the gulf there lies a shoal, along and narrow, and full of rocks, called Herone, facing the village of Cammoni; and opposite this on the left projects the promontory that lies before Astacampra, which is called Papica, and is a bad anchorage because of the strong current setting in around it and because the anchors are cut off, the bottom being rough and rocky. 

Ἀλλʼ ἐκ μὲν τῶν
δεξιῶν κατʼ αὐτὸ τὸ στόμα τοῦ κόλπου παράκειται ταινία τραχεῖα καὶ διάσπιλος, Ἡρώνη λεγομένη, κατὰ Καμμωνὶ κώμην· ἐκ δὲ τῶν εὐωνύμων ἀπέναντι ταύτης τὸ πρὸ Ἀστακάπρων ἀκρωτήριον, ἡ Παπικὴ λεγομένη, δύσορμος οὖσα διά τε τὸν ῥοῦν τὸν περὶ αὐτὴν
καὶ διὰ τὸ ἀποκόπτειν τὰς ἀγκύρας τραχὺν ὄντα καὶ πετρώδη τὸν βυθόν. 

And even if the entrance to the gulf is made safely, the mouth of the river at Barygaza is found with difficulty, because the shore is very low and cannot be made out until you are close upon it. And when you have found it the passage is difficult because of the shoals at the mouth of the river.

Κἂν κατʼ αὐτὸν δέ τις ἐπιβάλῃ τὸν κόλπον, αὐτὸ τὸ στόμα τοῦ κατὰ Βαρύγαζα ποταμοῦ δυσεύρετόν ἐστι διὰ τὸ τὴν χώραν ταπεινήν εἶναι καὶ μηδὲν ἐγγύτερον ἐνεχύρως θεωρεῖσθαι· κἂν
εὑρεθῇ, δυσείσβολός ἐστι διὰ τὰ περὶ αὐτὸν τενάγη τοῦ ποταμοῦ.

## 44
Because of this, native fishermen in the King's service, stationed at the very entrance in well-manned large boats called trappaga and cotymba, go up the coast as far as Syrastrene, from which they pilot vessels to Barygaza. 

44 Τούτου χάριν περὶ αὐτὸν τὸν εἴσπλουν βασιλικοὶ ἁλιεῖς ἐντόπιοι πληρώμασι μακρῶν πλοίων, ἃ λέγεται τράππαγα καὶ κότυμβα, πρὸς ἀπάντησιν ἐξέρχονται
μέχρι τῆς Συραστρηνῆς, ἀφʼ ὧν ὁδηγεῖται τὰ πλοῖα μέχρι Βαρυγάζων. 

And they steer them straight from the mouth of the bay between the shoals with their crews; and they tow them to fixed stations, going up with the beginning of the flood, and lying through the ebb at anchorages and in basins. 

Κλίνουσι γὰρ εὐθὺς ἀπὸ τοῦ στόματος τοῦ κόλπου διὰ τενάγη τοῖς πληρώμασι καὶ ῥυμουλκοῦσιν αὐτὰ σταθμοῖς ἤδη τεταγμένοις, ἀρχο μένης μὲν τῆς πλήμης αἴροντες, ἱσταμένης δὲ διορμίζοντες
κατά τινας ὅρμους καὶ κυθρίνους. 

These basins are deeper places in the river as far as Barygaza; which lies by the river, about three hundred stadia up from the mouth.

Οἱ δὲ κύθρινοι τόποι εἰσὶ τοῦ ποταμοῦ βαθύτεροι μέχρι Βαρυγάζων· ἀπέχει γὰρ ἀπὸ τοῦ στόματος ἄων παρὰ τὸν ποταμὸν κειμένη ὡς σταδίων τριακοσίων.

## 45
Now the whole country of India has very many rivers, and very great ebb and flow of the tides; increasing at the new moon, and at the full moon for three days, and falling off during the intervening days of the moon. But about Barygaza it is much greater, so that the bottom is suddenly seen, and now parts of the dry land are sea, and now it is dry where ships were sailing just before; and the rivers, under the inrush of the flood tide, when the whole force of the sea is directed against them, are driven upwards more strongly against their natural current, for many stadia.

45 Πᾶσα μὲν ἡ Ἰνδικὴ χώρα ποταμοὺς ἔχει πλμίστους,

292
ἀμπώτεις τε καὶ πλήμας μεγίστας, συναυξομένας ὑπὸ τὴν ἀνατολὴν καὶ τὴν πανσέληνον ἄχρι τριῶν ἡμερῶν, καὶ τοῖς μεταξὺ καταστήμασι τῆς σελήνης ἐλασσουμένας, πολὺ δὲ μᾶλλον ἡ κατὰ Βαρυγάζων,
ὥστε αἰφνίδιον τόν τε βυθὸν δρᾶσθαι, καὶ ⋯ τινα μέρη τῆς ἠπείρου, ποτὶ δὲ ξηρὰ τὰ πρὸ μικροῦ πλωῖζόμενα, τούς τε ποταμοὺς ὑπὸ τὴν εἰσβολὴν τῆς πλήμης, τοῦ πελάγους ὅλου συνωθουμένου, σφοδρότερον ἄνω φέρεσθαι τοῦ κατὰ φύσιν ῥεύματος ἐπὶ πλείστους σταδίους.

## 46
For this reason entrance and departure of vessels is very dangerous to those who are inexperienced or who come to this market-town for the first time. 

46 Διὸ καὶ κινδυνώδεις εἰσὶν αἱ τῶν πλοίων προσαγωγαὶ καὶ ἐξαγωγαὶ τοῖς ἀπείροις καὶ πρώτως εἰσάγουσιν εἰς τὸ ἐμπόριον. 

For the rush of waters at the incoming tide is irresistible, and the anchors cannot hold against it; so that large ships are caught up by the force of it, turned broadside on through the speed of the current, and so driven on the shoals and wrecked; and smaller boats are over-turned; and those that have been turned aside among the channels by the receding waters at the ebb, are left on their sides, and if not held on an even keel by props, the flood tide comes upon them suddenly and under the first head of the current they are filled with water. 

Γινομένης γὰρ ὁρμῆς ἤδη περὶ τὴν πλήμην οὐδὲν παριεμένης οὐκ ἀντέχουσιν [αἱ] ἄγκυραι· διὸ καὶ τὰ προληφθέντα πλοῖα τῇ ἰναίᾳ,
πλαγιασθέντα ὑπὸ τῆς ὀξύτητος τοῦ ῥοὸς, ἐποκέλλει τοῖς τενάγεσι καὶ ἀνακλᾶται, τὰ δὲ μικρότερα καὶ περιτρέπεται, τινὰ δὲ καὶ περὶ τὰς διώρυχας ἀποκεκλικότα διὰ τὸ περὶ τὴν ἄμπωτιν, ὅταν μὴ διερείσῃς, τῆς πλήμης αἰφνίδιον ἐπελθούσης, ὑπὸ τῆς πρώτης κεφαλῆς
τοῦ ῥοὸς ἐμπίμπλαται. 

For there is so great force in the rush of the sea at the new moon, especially during the flood tide at night, that if you begin the entrance at the moment when the waters are still, on the instant there is borne to you at the mouth of the river, a noise like the cries of an army heard from afar; and very soon the sea itself comes rushing in over the shoals with a hoarse roar.

Τοσαῦται γὰρ περὶ τὴν εἰσβολὴν τῆς θαλάσσης γίνονται βίαι κατὰ τὰς νεομηνίας ὑπὸ τὴν νυκτερινὴν μάλιστα πλήμην, ὥστε ἀρχομένης ἤδη τῆς εἰσαγωγῆς, ὅταν ἠρεμῇ τὸ πέλαγος, ὑπʼ αὐτοῦ φέρεσθαι τοῖς ἐπὶ τοῦ στόματος παραπλήσιον βοῇ
στρατοπέδου μακρόθεν ἀκουομένῃ, καὶ μετʼ ὀλίγον αὐτὴν ἐπιτρέχειν τοῖς τενάγεσι ῥοίζῳ τὴν θάλασσαν.

## 47
The country inland from Barygaza is inhabited by numerous tribes, such as the [Arattii](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aratta), the Arachosii, the Gandaraei and the people of Poclais, in which is [Bucephalus Alexandria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Bucephalus). 

47 Ἐπίκειται δὲ τοῖς Βαρυγάζοις κατὰ τὰ μεσόγεια πλείονα ἔθνη, τό τε τῶν Ἀρατρίων καὶ Ἀραχωσίων καὶ Γανδαραίων καὶ τῆς Προκλαΐδος, ἐν ᾗ ἡ Βουκέφαλος

293
Ἀλεξάνδρεια. 

Above these is the very war-like nation of the Bactrians, who are under their own king. 

Καὶ τούτων ἐπάνω μαχιμώτατον ἔθνος Βακτριανῶν, ὑπὸ βασιλέα ὄντων ἰδιότοπον. 

And Alexander, setting out from these parts, penetrated to the Ganges, leaving aside [Damirica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limyrike) and the southern part of India; and to the present day ancient drachma are current in Barygaza, coming from this country, bearing inscriptions in Greek letters, and the devices of those who reigned after Alexander, Apollodotus and Menander.

Καὶ Ἀλέξανδρος ὁρμηθεὶς ἀπὸ τῶν μερῶν τούτων ἄχρι τοῦ Γάγγους διῆλθε, καταλιπὼν τήν τε Λιμυρικήν
καὶ τὰ νότια τῆς Ἰνδικῆς· ἀφʼ οὗ μέχρι νῦν ἐν Βαρυγάζοις παλαιαὶ προχωροῦσι δραχμαὶ, γράμμασιν Ἑλληνικοῖς ἐγκεχαραγμέναι ἐπίσημα τῶν μετʼ Ἀλέξανδρον βεβασιλευκότων Ἀπολλοδότου καὶ Μενάνδρου.

## 48
Inland from this place and to the east, is the city called [Ozene](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ujjain), formerly a royal capital; from this place are brought down all things needed for the welfare of the country about Barygaza, and many things for our trade: [agate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agate) and [carnelian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnelian), Indian muslins and mallow cloth, and much ordinary cloth. 

48 Ἔνι δὲ αὐτῇ καὶ ἐξ ἀνατολῆς πόλις λεγομένη
Ὀζήνη, ἐν ᾗ καὶ τὰ βασίλεια πρότερον ἦν· ἀφʼ ἧς πάντα τὰ πρὸς εὐθηνίαν τῆς χώρας εἰς Βαρύγαζα καταφέρεται καὶ τὰ πρὸς ἐμπορίαν τὴν ἡμετέραν, ὀνυχίνη λιθία καὶ μουρρίνη καὶ σινδόνες Ἰνδικαὶ καὶ μολόχιναι καὶ ἱκανὸν χυδαῖον ὀθόνιον. 

Through this same region and from the upper country is brought the spikenard that comes through Poclais; that is, the Caspapyrene and Paropanisene and Cabolitic and that brought through the adjoining country of Scythia; also costus and bdellium.

Κατάγεται δὲ διʼ αὐτῆς
καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ἄνω τόπων ἡ διὰ Προκλαΐδος καταφερομένη νάρδος ἡ Καττυβουρίνη καὶ ἡ Πατροπαπίγη καὶ ἡ Καβαλίτη καὶ ἡ διὰ τῆς παρακειμένης Συυθίας, ὃ τε κόστος καὶ ἡ βδέλλα.

## 49
There are imported into this market-town, wine, Italian preferred, also Laodicean and Arabian; copper, tin, and lead; coral and topaz; thin clothing and inferior sorts of all kinds; bright-colored girdles a cubit wide; storax, sweet clover, flint glass, realgar, antimony, gold and silver coin, on which there is a profit when exchanged for the money of the country; and ointment, but not very costly and not much. And for the King there are brought into those places very costly vessels of silver, singing boys, beautiful maidens for the harem, fine wines, thin clothing of the finest weaves, and the choicest ointments. 

49 Προχωρεῖ δὲ εἰς τὸ ἐμπόριον οἶνος προηγουμένως
Ἰταλικὸς καὶ Λαοδικηνὸς καὶ Ἀραβικὸς καὶ χαλκὸς καὶ κασσίτερος καὶ μόλυβδος, κοράλλιον καὶ χρυσόλιθον, ἱματισμὸς ἀπλοῦς καὶ νόθος παντοῖος, πολύμιτοι ζῶναι πηχυαῖαι, στύραξ, μελίλωτον, ὕαλος ἀργὴ, σανδαράκη, στίμμι, δηνάριον χρυσοῦν καὶ ἀργυροῦν, ἔχον ἀλλαγὴν
καὶ ἐπικέρδειάν τινα πρὸς τὸ ἐντόπιον νόμισμα, μύρον οὐ βαρύτιμον οὐδὲ πολύ· τῷ δὲ βασιλεῖ κατʼ ἐκείνους τοὺς καιροὺς εἰσφερόμενα βαρύτιμα ἀργυρώματα καὶ μουσικὰ καὶ παρθένοι εὐειδεῖς πρὸς παλλακίαν καὶ διάφορος οἶνος καὶ ἱματισμὸς ἁπλοῦς πολυτελὴς καὶ
μύρον ἔξοχον. 

There are exported from these places spikenard, costus, bdellium, ivory, agate and carnelian, lycium, cotton cloth of all kinds, silk cloth, mallow cloth, yarn, long pepper and such other things as are brought here from the various market-towns. 

Φέρεται δὲ ἀπὸ τούτων τῶν τόπων νάρδος, κόστος, βδέλλα, ἐλέφας, ὀνυχίνη λιθία καὶ μουρρίνη καὶ λύκιον καὶ ὀθόνιον παντοῖον καὶ Σηρικὸν καὶ μολόχινον καὶ νῆμα καὶ πέπερι μακρὸν καὶ τὰ ἀπὸ τῶν ἐμπορίων φερόμενα. 

Those bound for this market-town from Egypt make the voyage favorably about the month of July, that is Epiphi.

Ἀποπλέουσι δὲ κατὰ καιρὸν
οἱ ἀπὸ τῆς Aἰγύπτου εἰς τὸ ἐμπόριον ἀναγόμενοι περὶ τὸν Ἰούλιον μῆνα, ὅς ἐστιν Ἐπιφί.

## 50
Beyond Barygaza the adjoining coast extends in a straight line from north to south; and so this region is called [Dachinabades](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakshinapatha#:~:text=Dachinabades), for dachanos in the language of the natives means "south." 

294
50 Μετὰ δὲ τὰ Βαρύγαζα εὐθέως ἡ συναφὴς ἤπειρος ἐκ τοῦ βορέου εἰς τὸν νότον παρεκτείνει· διὸ καὶ Δαχιναβάδης καλεῖται ἡ χώρα· δάχανος γὰρ καλεῖται ὁ νότος τῆ αὐτῶν γλώσσῃ. 

The inland country back from the coast toward the east comprises many desert regions and great mountains; and all kinds of wild beasts—leopards, tigers, elephants, enormous serpents, hyenas, and baboons of many sorts; and many populous nations, as far as the Ganges.

Ταύτης ἡ μὲν ὑπερκειμένη
πρὸς ἀνατολὰς μεσόγειος ἐμπεριέχει χώρας τε πολλὰς καὶ ἐρήμους καὶ ὄρη μεγάλα καὶ θηρίων γένη παντοίων, παρδάλεις τε καὶ τίγρεις καὶ ἐλέφαντας καὶ δράκοντας ὑπερμεγέθεις καὶ κροκόττας καὶ κυνοκεφάλων πλεῖστα γένη, ἕθνη τε πλεῖστα καὶ πολυάνθρωπα μέχρι τοῦ
Γάγγους.

## 51
Among the market-towns of Dachinabades there are two of special importance; [Paethana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paithan), distant about twenty days' journey south from Barygaza; beyond which, about ten days' journey east, there is another very great city, Tagara. 

51 Τῶν δὲ ἐν αὐτῇ τῇ Δαχιναβάδει δύο ἐστὶ τὰ διασημότατα ἐμπόρια, Παίθανα μὲν ἀπὸ Βαρυγάζων ἀπέχοντα ὁδὸν ἡμερῶν εἴκοσι πρὸς νότον, ἀπὸ δὲ ταύτης ὡς ἡμερῶν δέκα πρὸς ἀνατολὴν ἑτέρα πόλις μεγίστη
Τάγαρα. 

There are brought down to Barygaza from these places by wagons and through great tracts without roads, from Paethana carnelian in great quantity, and from Tagara much common cloth, all kinds of muslins and mallow cloth, and other merchandise brought there locally from the regions along the sea-coast. 

Κατάγεται δὲ ἐξ αὐτῶν, πορείαις ἁμαξῶν καὶ ἀνοδίαις μεγίσταις εἰς τὰ Βαρύγαζα ἀπὸ μὲν Παιθάνων ὀνυχίνη λιθία πλείστη, ἀπὸ δὲ Ταγάρων ὀθόνιον πολὺ χυδαῖον καὶ σινδόνων παντοῖα καὶ μολόχινα καί τινα ἄλλα τοπικῶς ἐκεῖ προχωροῦντα
φορτία τῶν παραθαλασσίων μερῶν. 

And the whole course to the end of Damirica is seven thousand stadia; but the distance is greater to the Coast Country.

Ὁ δὲ ὅλος παράπλους μέχρι τῆς Λιμυρικῆς ἐστὶ σταδίων ἑπτακισχιλίων, πλεῖστοι δὲ εἰς Aἰγιαλόν.

## 52
The market-towns of this region are, in order, after Barygaza: [Suppara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nallasopara#History), and the city of [Calliena](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalyan), which in the time of the elder [Saraganus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satakarni_II) became a lawful Market-town; but since it came into the possession of Sandares the port is much obstructed, and Greek ships landing there may chance to be taken to Barygaza under guard.

52 Τοπικὰ δὲ ἐμπόρια κατὰ τὸ ἑξῆς κείμενα Ἀκαβάρου,

296
Σούππαρα, Καλλίενα πόλις, ἐπὶ τῶν Σαραγάνου τοῦ πρεσβυτέρου χρόνων ἐμπόριον ἔνθεσμον γενόμενον· μετὰ γὰρ τὸ κατασχεῖν αὐτὴν Σανδένην ἐκωλύθη ἐπὶ πολὺ, καὶ γὰρ τὰ ἐκ τύχης εἰς τούτους
τοὺς τόπους εἰσβάλλοντα πλοῖα Ἑλληνικὰ μετὰ φυλακῆς εἰς Βαρύγαζα εἰσάγεται.

## 53
Beyond Calliena there are other market-towns of this region; Semylla, Mandagora, Palaepatmae, Melizigara, Byzantium, Togarum and Aurannoboas. Then there are the islands called Sesecrienae and that of the Aegidii, and that of the Caenitae, opposite the place called Chersonesus (and in these places there are pirates), and after this the White Island. Then come Naura and [Tyndis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyndis), the first markets of Damirica, and then Muziris and [Nelcynda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelcynda), which are now of leading importance.

53 Μετὰ δὲ Καλλίεναν ἄλλα ἐμπόρια τοπικὰ Εήμυλλα καὶ Μανδαγόρα καὶ Παλαιπάτμαι καὶ Μελιζειγάρα

## 54
Tyndis is of the Kingdom of [Cerobothra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chera_dynasty); it is a village in plain sight by the sea. Muziris, of the same Kingdom, abounds in ships sent there with cargoes from Arabia, and by the Greeks; it is located on a river, distant from Tyndis by river and sea five hundred stadia, and up the river from the shore twenty stadia. 

54 Βασιλείας δʼ ἐστὶν ἡ μὲν Τύνδις Κηπροβότρου,

297
κώμη παραθαλάσσιος ἔνσημος· ἡ δὲ Μουζιρὶς βασιλείας μὲν τῆς αὐτῆς, ἀκμάζουσα δὲ τοῖς ἀπὸ τῆς Ἀριακῆς εἰς αὐτὴν ἐρχομένοις πλοίοις καὶ τοῖς Ἑλληνικοῖς· κεῖται δὲ παρὰ ποταμὸν, ἀπέχουσα ἀπὸ μὲν
Τύνδεως διὰ τοῦ ποταμοῦ καὶ διὰ θαλάσσης σταδίους πεντακοσίους, ἀπὸ δὲ τοῦ ⋯ κατʼ αὐτὴν εἴκοσι. 

Nelcynda is distant from Muziris by river and sea about five hundred stadia, and is of another Kingdom, the Pandian. This place also is situated on a river, about one hundred and twenty stadia from the sea.

Ἡ δὲ gentu, Νέλκυνδα σταδίους μὲν ἀπὸ Μουζιρέως ἀπέχει σχεδὸν πεντακοσίους, ὁμοίως διά τε ποταμοῦ καὶ πεζῇ καὶ διὰ θαλάσσης, βασιλείας δέ ἐστιν ἑτέρας, τῆς

There is another place at the mouth of this river, the village of Bacare; to which ships drop down on the outward voyage from Nelcynda, and anchor in the roadstead to take on their cargoes; because the river is full of shoals and the channels are not clear. 

55 Ἑτέρα δὲ κατʼ αὐτὸ τὸ στόμα τοῦ ποταμοῦ πρόκειται κώμη βακαρὴ, εἰς ἣν ἀπὸ Νελκύνδων ἐπὶ

298
τῆς ἀναγωγῆς προκαταβαίνουσι τὰ πλοῖα καὶ ἐπὶ σάλου διορμίζεται πρὸς ἀνάληψιν τῶν φορτίων διὰ δὴ τὸν ποταμὸν ἕρματα καὶ διάπλους ἔχειν ἐλαφρούς. 

The kings of both these market-towns live in the interior. 

Αὐτοὶ δὲ οἱ βασιλεῖς ἀμφοτέρων τῶν ἐμπορίων ἐν τῆ μεσογείᾳ
κατοικοῦσι. 

And as a sign to those approaching these places from the sea there are serpents coming forth to meet you, black in color, but shorter, like snakes in the head, and with blood-red eyes.

Καὶ περὶ τούσδε τοὺς τόπους τοῖς ἐκ πελάγους [ἐρχομένοις] σημεῖον ἐπιβολῆς εἰσιν οἱ προαπαντῶντες ὄφεις, μέλανες μὲν καὶ αὐτοὶ τὴν χρόαν, βραχύτεροι δὲ καὶ δρακοντοειδεῖς τὴν κεφαλήν καὶ τοῖς ὄμμασιν αἱματώδεις.

## 56
They send large ships to these market-towns on account of the great quantity and bulk of pepper and malabathrum. 

56 Πλεῖ δὲ εἰς τὰ ἐμπόρια ταῦτα μεγάλα πλοῖα διὰ τὸν ὄγκον καὶ τὸ πλῆθος τοῦ πεπέρεως καὶ τοῦ μαλαβάθρου. 

There are imported here, in the first place, a great quantity of coin; topaz, thin clothing, not not much; figured linens, antimony, coral, crude glass, copper, tin, lead; wine, not much, but as much as at Barygaza; realgar and orpiment; and wheat enough for the sailors, for this is not dealt in by the merchants there. 

Προχωρεῖ δὲ εἰς αὐτὴν προηγουμένως χρήματα πλεῖστα, χρυσόλιθα, ἱματισμὸς ἁπλοῦς οὐ πολὺς, πολύμιτα, στίμμι, κοράλλιον, ὕαλος ἀργὴ,
χαλκὸς, κασσίτερος, μόλυβδος, σἶνος οὐ πολὺς, ὡσεὶ δὲ τοσοῦτον ὅσον ἐν Βαρυγάζοις, σανδαράκη, ἀρσενικὸν, σῑτος δὲ ὅσος ἀρκέσει τοῖς περὶ τὸ ναυκλήριον διὰ τὸ μὴ τοὺς ἐμπόρους αὐτῷ χρῆσθαι. 

There is exported pepper, which is produced in quantity in only one region near these markets, a district called [Cottonara](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuttanad#:~:text=cottanara).  Besides this there are exported great quantities of fine pearls, ivory, silk cloth, spikenard from the Ganges, malabathrum from the places in the interior, transparent stones of all kinds, diamonds and sapphires, and tortoise-shell; that from Chryse Island, and that taken among the islands along the coast of Damirica. 

Φέρεται δὲ πέπερι μονογενῶς ἐν ἑνὶ τόπῳ τούτων τῶν ἐμπορίων
γεννώμενον πολὺ, τῇ λεγομένῃ Κοττοναρικῇ· φέρεται δὲ καὶ μαργαρίτης ἱκανὸς καὶ διάφορος καὶ ἐλέφας καὶ ὀθόνια Σηρικὰ καὶ νάρδος ἡ Γαγγητικὴ καὶ μαλάβαθρον ἐκ τῶν ἔσω τόπων εἰς αὐτὴν, καὶ λιθία διαφανὴς παντοία καὶ ἀδάμας καὶ ὑάκινθος καὶ χελώνη ἥ τε Χρυσονησιωτικὴ
καὶ ἡ περὶ τὰς νήσους θηρευομένη τὰς προκειμένας αὐτῆς τῆς Λιμυρικῆς. 

They make the voyage to this place in a favorable season who set out from Egypt about the month of July, that is Epiphi.

Πλέουσι δὲ εἰς αὐ τὴν οἱ κατὰ καιρὸν ἀναγόμενοι ἀπʼ Αἰγύπτου περὶ τὸν Ἰούλιον μῆνα, ὃ ἐστιν Ἐπιφί.

## 57
This whole voyage as above described, from Cana and Eudaemon Arabia, they used to make in small vessels, sailing close around the shores of the gulfs; and Hippalus was the pilot who by observing the location of the ports and the conditions of the sea, first discovered how to lay his course straight across the ocean. For at the same time when with us the Etesian winds are blowing, on the shores of India the wind sets in from the ocean, and this southwest wind is called Hippalus, from the name of him who first discovered the passage across. 

57 Τοῦτον δὲ ὅλον τὸν εἰρημένον περίπλουν ἀπὸ
Κανῆς καὶ τῆς Εὐδαίμονος Ἀραβίας οἱ μὲν ⋯μικροτέροις πλοίοις περικολπίζοντες ἔπλεον, πρῶτος δὲ Ἵππαλος

299
κυβερνήτης, κατανοήσας τὴν θέσιν τῶν ἐμπορίων καὶ τὸ σχῆμα τῆς θαλάσσης, τὸν διὰ πελάγους ἐξεῦρε πλοῦν, ἀφʼ οὐ καὶ τοπικῶς ἐκ τοῦ ὠκεανοῦ φυσώντων, κατὰ τὸν καιρὸν τῶν παῤ ἡμῖν, ἐτησίων ἐν τῶ Ἰνδικῷ πελάγει
ὁ λιβόνοτος φαίνεται [ἵππαλος] προςονομάζεσθαι [ἀπὸ τῆς προσηγορίας τοῦ πρώτως ἐξευρηκότος τὸν διάπλουν]. 

From that time to the present day ships start, some direct from Cana, and some from the Cape of Spices; and those bound for Damirica throw the ship's head considerably off the wind; while those bound for Barygaza and Scythia keep along shore not more than three days and for the rest of the time hold the same course straight out to sea from that region, with a favorable wind, quite away from the land, and so sail outside past the aforesaid gulfs.

Ἀφʼ οὗ μέχρι καὶ νῦν τινὲς μὲν εὐθὺς ἀπὸ τῶν Κανῆς, τινὲς δὲ ἀπὸ τῶν Ἀρωμάτων ἀφιέντες οἱ μὲν εἰς Λιμυρικὴν πλέοντες ἐπὶ πλεῖον τραχηλίζοντες,

## 58
Beyond Bacare there is the [Dark Red Mountain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marunthuvazh_Malai), and another district stretching along the coast toward the south, called Paralia. The first place is called Balita; it has a fine harbor and a village by the shore. Beyond this there is another place called [Comari](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanyakumari) at which are the Cape of Comari and a harbor; hither come those men who wish to consecrate themselves for the rest of their lives, and bathe and dwell in celibacy; and women also do the same; for it is told that a [goddess](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devi_Kanya_Kumari) once dwelt here and bathed.

58 Ἀπὸ δὲ Βακαρῆς τὸ λεγόμενον Πυρρὸν ὄρος ἄλλῃ

## 59
From Comari toward the south this region extends to Colchi, where the pearl-fisheries are; (they are worked by condemned criminals); and it belongs to the Pandian Kingdom. Beyond Colchi there follows another district called the Coast Country, which lies on a bay, and has a region inland called Argaru. At this place, and nowhere else, are bought the pearls gathered on the coast thereabouts; and from there are exported muslins, those called Argaritic.

59 Ἀπὸ δὲ τοῦ Κομαρεὶ ἐκτείνουσα πρὸς τὸν νότον χώρα μέχρι Κόλχων, ἐν ᾗ κολύμβησις τοῦ πινικοῦ ἐστίν ἀπὸ δὲ κατακρισίμων κατεργάζεται· ὑπὸ τὸν

## 60
Among the market-towns of these countries, and the harbors where the ships put in from Damirica and from the north, the most important are, in order as they lie, first Camara, then Poduca, then Sopatma; in which there are ships of the country coasting along the shore as far as Damirica; and other very large vessels made of single logs bound together, called sangara: but those which make the voyage to [Chryse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suvarnabhumi) and to the Ganges are called colandia, and are very large. 

60 Τῶν δὲ τοπικῶν ἐμπορίων τε καὶ ὅρμων, εἰς οὃς
οἵ τε ἀπὸ τῆς Aιμυρικῆς καὶ ἀπʼ ἄρκτου πλέοντες κατάγονται, ἐπισημότερα καὶ κατὰ τὸ ἑξῆς κείμενά ἐστιν ἐμπόρια Καμάρα καὶ Ποδούκη καὶ Σωπάτμα, ἐν οἷς τοπικὰ μέν ἐστι πλοῖα μέχρι Λιμυρικῆς παραλεγόμενα τὴν γῆν, ἕτερα ὃ ἐκ μονοξύλων πλοίων μεγίστων
ἁφαῖς ἐζευγμένων, λεγόμενα σάγγαρα, τὰ δὲ εἰς τὴν Χρυσῆν καὶ εἰς τὸν Γάγγην διαίροντα κολανδιοφωντα τὰ μέγιστα. 

There are imported into these places everything made in Damirica, and the greatest part of what is brought at any time from Egypt comes here, together with most kinds of all the things that are brought from Damirica and of those that are carried through Paralia.

Προχωρεῖ δὲ εἰς τοὺς τόπους πάντα τὰ εἰς τὴν Aιμυρικὴν ἐργαζόμενα, καὶ σχεδὸν εἰς αὐτοὺς καταντᾷ τό τε χρῆμα τὸ ἀπʼ Aἰγύπτου φερόμενον τῷ

## 61
About the following region, the course trending toward the east, lying out at sea toward the west is the island Palaesimundu, called by the ancients [Taprobane](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taprobana). The northern part is a day's journey distant, and the southern part trends gradually toward the west, and almost touches the opposite shore of Azania. 

61 Περὶ δὲ τὴν μετʼ αὐτὴν χώραν, ἤδη πρὸς ἀνατολὴν τοῦ πλοὸς ἀπονεύοντος, εἰς πέλαγος ἔκκειται
πρὸς αὐτὴν τὴν δύσιν νῆσος λεγομένη Παλαισιμούνδου,

302
παρὰ δὲ τοῖς ἀρχαίοις αὐτῶν Ταπροβάνη. Ταύτης τὰ μὲν πρὸς βορέαν ἐστὶν ἥμερα καὶ διαπλεῖται τοῖς εἰς τὸν πλιονακιστινει καὶ σχεδὸν εἰς τὸ κατʼ αὐτῆς ἀντιπαρακείμενον Ἀζανίας παρήκει. 

It produces pearls, transparent stones, muslins, and tortoise-shell.

Γίνεται δὲ ἐν αὐτῇ πινικὸν
καὶ λιθία διαφανής καὶ σινδόνες καὶ χελῶναι.

## 62
About these places is the region of Masalia stretching a great way along the coast before the inland country; a great quantity of muslins is made there. 

62 Περὶ δὲ τούτους τοὺς τόπους πολὺ τῇ μεσογείῳ παρήκουσα Μασαλία παράκειται χώρα· γίνονται ἐν αὐτῇ σινδόνες πλεῖσται. 

Beyond this region, sailing toward the east and crossing the adjacent bay, there is the region of Dosarene, yielding the ivory known as Dosarenic. Beyond this, the course trending toward the north, there are many barbarous tribes, among whom are the Cirrhadae, a race of men with flattened noses, very savage; another tribe, the Bargysi; and the Horse-faces and the Long-faces, who are said to be cannibals.

Ἀπὸ δὲ ταύτης εἰς αὐτὴν τὴν ἀνατολὴν διαπεράσαντι τὸν παρακείμενον κόλπον
ἡ Δησαρηνὴ χώρα, φέρουσα ἐλέφαντα τὸν λεγόμενον βωσαρὴ, καὶ μετʼ αὐτὴν, εἰς τὸν βορέαν ἤδη ἀπονεύοντος τοῦ πλοὸς, βάρβαρα πολλὰ ἔθνη, ἐν οἷς οἱ Κιρρᾶδαι, γένος ἀνθρώπων ἐντεθλιμμένων τὴν ῥῖνα,

303
ἀγρίων, καὶ Βαργύσων ἕτερον ἔθνος καὶ τὸ τῶν Ἱππιοπροσώπων [ἢ] Μακροπροσώπων, λεγόμενον ἀνθρωποφάγον εἶναι.

## 63
After these, the course turns toward the east again, and sailing with the ocean to the right and the shore remaining beyond to the left, Ganges comes into view, and near it the very last land toward the east, [Chryse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suvarnabhumi). 

63 Μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα, εἰς τὴν ἀνατολὴν [πλεόντων]
καὶ τὸν ὠκεανὸν ἐν δεξιοῖς ἐχόντων, εὐώνυμα δὲ τὰ λοιπὰ μέρη ἔξωθεν παραπλεόντων, ὁ Γάγγης ἀπαντᾷ καὶ ἡ περὶ αὐτὴν ἐσχάτη τῆς ἀνατολῆς ἤπειρος, ἡ Χρυσῆ. 

There is a river near it called the Ganges, and it rises and falls in the same way as the Nile. On its bank is a market-town which has the same name as the river, Ganges. Through this place are brought malabathrum and Gangetic spikenard and pearls, and muslins of the finest sorts, which are called Gangetic. 

Ποταμὸς δέ ἐστι περὶ αὐτὴν ὁ Γάγγης λεγόμενος, καὶ αὐτὸς μέγιστος τῶν κατὰ τὴν Ἰνδικὴν,
ἀπόβασίν τε καὶ ἀνάβασιν τὴν αὐτὴν ἔχων τῷ Νείλῳ, καθʼ ὃν καὶ ἐμπόριόν ἐστιν ὁμώνυμον τῷ ποταμῷ, ὁ Γάγγης, διʼ οἷ φέρεται τό τε μαλάβαθρον καὶ ἡ Γαγγητικὴ νάρδος καὶ πινικὸν καὶ σινδόνες αἱ διαφορώταται, αἱ Γαγγητικαὶ λεγόμεναι. 

It is said that there are gold-mines near these places, and there is a gold coin which is called caltis. 

Λέγεται δὲ καὶ
χρυσωρύχια περὶ τοὺς τόπους εἶναι, νόμισμά τε χρυ σοῦ, ὁ λεγόμενος κάλτις. 

And just opposite this river there is an island in the ocean, the last part of the inhabited world toward the east, under the rising sun itself; it is called [Chryse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suvarnabhumi); and it has the best tortoise-shell of all the places on the Erythraean Sea.

Κατʼ αὐτὸν δὲ τὸν ποταμὸν νῆσός ἐστιν ὠκεάνιος, ἐσχάτη τῶν πρὸς ἀνατολὴν μερῶν τῆς οἰκουμένης, ὑπʼ αὐτὸν ἀνέχοντα τὸν ἥλιον, καλουμένη Χρυσῆ, χελώνην ἔχουσα πάντων τῶν κατὰ
τὴν Ἐρυθρὰν τόπων ἀρίστην.

## 64
After this region under the very north, the sea outside ending in a land called This, there is a very great inland city called [Thinae](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/China), from which raw silk and silk yarn and silk cloth are brought on foot through Bactria to Barygaza, and are also exported to Damirica by way of the river Ganges. 

64 Μετὰ δὲ ταύτην τὴν χώραν ὑπʼ αὐτὸν ἤδη τὸν βορέαν, ἔξωθεν εἰς Θινός τινα τόπον ἀποληγούσης τῆς θαλάσσης, παράκειται ἐν αὐτῇ πόλις μεσόγειος μεγίστη, λεγομένη Θῖναι, ἀφʼ ἧς τό τε ἔριον καὶ τὸ νῆμα καὶ τὸ
οόνιον τὸ Σηρικὸν εἰς τὰ Βαρύγαζα διὰ Βάκτρων πεζῇ φέρεται καὶ εἰς τὴν Λιμυρικὴν πάλιν διὰ τοῦ Γάγγου

304
ποταμοῦ. 

But the land of This is not easy of access; few men come from there, and seldom. 

Εἰς δὲ τὴν Θῖνα ταύτην οὐκ ἔστιν εὐχερῶς ἀπελθεῖν· σπανίως γὰρ ἀπʼ αὐτῆς τινὲς οὐ πολλοὶ ἔρχονται. 

The country lies under the Lesser Bear, and is said to border on the farthest parts of Pontus and the Caspian Sea, next to which lies Lake Maeotis; all of which empty into the ocean.

Κεῖται δὲ ὁ τόπος ὑπʼ αὐτὴν τὴν μικρὰν ἄρκτον, λέγεται δὲ συνορίζειν τοῖς ἀπεστραμμένοις
μέρεσι τοῦ Πόντου καὶ τῆς Κασπίας θαλάσσης, καθʼ ἣν ἡ παρακειμένη λίμνη Μαιῶτις εἰς τὸν ὠκεανὸν συναναστομοῦσα.

## 65
Every year on the borders of the land of This there comes together a tribe of men with short bodies and broad, flat faces, and by nature peaceable; they are called Besatae, and are almost entirely uncivilized. They come with their wives and children, carrying great packs and plaited baskets of what looks like green grape-leaves. They meet in a place between their own country and the land of This. There they hold a feast for several days, spreading out the baskets under themselves as mats, and then return to their own places in the interior. And then the natives watching them come into that place and gather up their mats; and they pick out from the braids the fibers which they call petri. 

65 Κατʼ ἔτος δὲ παραγίνεται ἐπὶ τὴν συνορίαν τῆς Θινὸς ἔθνος τι, τῷ μὲν σώματι κολοβοὶ καὶ σφόδρα
πλατυπρόσωποι, ἐννοίαις δὲ λῷστοι αὐτοὺς [δὲ] λέγεσθαί [φασι] Σησάτας, παρομοίους ἀνημέροις· παραγίνονται σὺν γυναιξὶ καὶ τέκνοις, βαστάζοντες φορτία μεγάλα [καὶ] ταρπόνας ὠμαμπελίνοις παραπλησίας, εἶτʼ ἐνεπιμένουσιν ἐπί τινα τόπον τῆς συνορίας
αὐτῶν καὶ τῶν ἐπὶ τῆς Θινὸς, καὶ ἑορτάζουσιν ἐπί τινας ἡμέρας, ὑποστρώσαντες ἑαυτοῖς τὰς ταρπόνας, καὶ ἀπαίρουσιν εἰς τὰ ἴδια εἰς τοὺς ἐσωτέρους τόπους. 

They lay the leaves closely together in. several layers and make them into balls, which they pierce with the fibers from the mats. And there are three sorts; those made of the largest leaves are called the large-ball malabathrum; those of the smaller, the medium-ball; and those of the smallest, the small-ball. Thus there exist three sorts of malabathrum, and it is brought into India by those who prepare it.

Οἱ δὲ ταῦτα δοκεύοντες τότε παραγίνονται ἐπὶ τοὺς τόπους καὶ συλλέγουσι τὰ ἐκείνων ὑποστρώματα,
καὶ ἐξινιάσαντες καλάμους τοὺς λεγομένους πέτρους ἐπὶ λεπτὸν ἐπιδιπλώσαντες τὰ φύλλα καὶ σφαιροειδῆ ποιοῦντες διείρουσι ταῖς ἀπὸ τῶν καλάμων ἴναις. Γίνεται δὲ γένη τρία· ἐκ μὲν τοῦ μείζονος φύλλου τὸ ἁδρόσφαιρον μαλάβαθρον λεγόμενον, ἐκ δὲ τοῦ ὑποδεεστέρου

305
τὸ μεσόσφαιρον, ἐκ δὲ τοῦ μικροτέρου τὸ μικρόσφαιρον. Ἔνθεν τὰ τρία μέρη τοῦ μαλαβάθρου γίνεται καὶ τότε φέρεται εἰς τὴν Ἰνδικὴν ὑπὸ τῶν κατεργαζομένων αὐτά.

## 66
The regions beyond these places are either difficult of access because of their excessive winters and great cold, or else cannot be sought out because of some divine influence of the gods.

66 Τὰ δὲ μετὰ [τούτους] τοὺς τόπους, διά τε ὑπερβολὰς χειμώνων καὶ πάγους μεγίστους δύσβατα ὄντα, εἴτε καὶ θείᾳ τινὶ δυνάμει θεῶν, ἀνερεύνητά ἐστιν.
