25 τίς δ' οὔ με μάντις ἢ τίς οὐ θύτησ̣ ἕλκει;

"Who does not draw me as a prophet or as a sacrificer?

καὶ Πυθίη γὰρ ἐν δάφνῃ μὲν ἵδρυται,
δάφνην δ' ἀείδει καὶ δάφνην ὑπέστρωται.

For the Pythia is seated among laurel,  
she sings of laurel and is spread upon laurel.  

ὤφρων ἐλαίη, τοὺς δὲ παῖδας οὐ Βράγχος
τοὺς τῶν Ἰώνων, οἷς ὁ Φοῖβος ὠ̣[ργίσθη,
30 δάφνῃ τε κρούων κἦπος οὐ τομ̣[ὸν λαοῖ]ς
δὶς ἢ τρὶς ε[ἰ]πὼν ἀρτεμέας ἐποίη[σε;

O prudent olive tree, but the children—  
not Branchus, those of the Ionians,  
whom Phoebus [Apollo] was angered at—  
striking with laurel and not [cutting] the grove for the people, twice or thrice having said ‘pure’..."

κ]ἠ̣γὼ μὲν ἢ 'πὶ δαῖτας ἢ 'ς χορὸν φ[οι]τέω
τὸν Πυθαϊστήν· 

I either work for feasts or into the chorus of the Pythian Games; 

γίνομαι δὲ κἄεθλον·

I become both a contest and a prize.  

οἱ Δωριῆς δὲ Τεμπόθεν με τέμνουσιν
35 ὀρέων ἀπ' ἄκρων καὶ φέρουσιν ἐς Δελφούς,
ἐπὴν τὰ τὠπόλλωνος ἵρ' ἀγινῆται.

The Dorians from Tempe cut me from the tops of the mountains and bring me to Delphi,  
when the holy offerings of the people are gathered.  

ἱρὴ γάρ εἰμι· 

For I am sacred; 

πῆμα δ' οὐχὶ γινώσκω

but I do not know the pain,  

οὐδ' οἶδ' ὁ̣κ̣[οίη]ν οὑλαφηφόρος κάμ̣πτει,

nor do I understand what the harvesters of olive trees bend.  

ἁγνὴ γάρ εἰμι, κοὐ πατεῦσί μ' ἄνθρωποι,

I am pure, and men do not strike me.  

40 ὤφρων ἐλαίη, σοὶ δὲ χὠπότ' ἂν νεκρόν
μέλλωσι καίειν ἢ̣ [τά]φ̣[ῳ] περιστέλλει[ν,
αὐτοί τ' ἀνεστέψ[αντο χ]ὐπὸ τὰ πλευρά
τοῦ μὴ πνέοντ[οσ...]παξ ὑπ[έ]σ̣τ[ρωσαν.'

O prudent olive tree, to you, if ever a corpse  
is about to burn or to be enclosed in a tomb,  
they themselves laid me out beneath the ribs of the one who does not breathe...
