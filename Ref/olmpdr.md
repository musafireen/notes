SUMMARY: This fragment quotes the famous saying that many carry the thyrsus of Dionysus, but few are intoxicated with him.

235 (237) σχόλιον Ὀλυμπιοδώρου επὶ Φαίδωνος Πλάτωνος 68 c p. 48, 20 William Norvin:

διὸ καὶ παρωιδεῖ ἔπος Ὀρφικὸν τὸ λέγον, 

“Wherefore he (Πλάτών) also alludes to the Orphic verse which says: 

ὅτι· ὅστις δ’ ἡμῶν ἀτέλεστος ὥσπερ ἐν βορβόρωι κείσεται ἐν Ἅιδου· τελετὴ γὰρ ἐστιν ἡ τῶν ἀρετῶν βακχεία· και φησιν·

anyone uninitiated in the Mysteries will lie in the muck in Aidîs (Ἅιδης), for the initiation is the Vakkhic orgy of the virtues. And he says:

πολλοὶ μὲν ναρθηκοφόροι παῦροι δὲ τε βάκχοι,

‘Many bearers of the staff of Diónysos, but few are intoxicated with him,’

ναρθηκοφόρους, οὐ μὴν βάκχους τοὺς πολιτικοὺς καλῶν, ναρθηκοφόρους δὲ καὶ βάκχους τοὺς καθαρτικούς· 

“calling politicians thyrsos-bearers, yet not truly intoxicated by him, but those thyrsos-bearers with Vakkhic intoxication are fit for purifying. 

καὶ γὰρ ἐνδούμεθα μὲν τῆι ὕληι ὡς Τιτᾶνες διὰ τὸν πολὺν μερισμόν· πολὺ γὰρ τὸ ἐμὸν καὶ σόν· ἀνεγειρόμεθα δὲ ὡς βάκχοι· διὸ καὶ περὶ τὸν θάνατον μαντικώτεροι γινόμεθα, καὶ ἔφορος δὲ τοῦ θανάτου ὁ Διόνυσος, διότι καὶ πάσης βακχείας. 

For we are entangled with matter just as the Titans (Τιτᾶνες), because of the great division: for ‘big’ becomes ‘mine’ or ‘thine;’ and we are roused just as the Vákkhi (βάκχοι); and wherefore as regards death, we become prophetic, and the guardian of death is Diónysos, because he also protects all Vakkhic frenzy. 

### p49
καὶ εὖ γε τοῦ λόγου, διότι καὶ ἀπὸ |49 Norv. θεοῦ ἤρξατο, ἡνίκα ἔλεγεν ‘ ὁ μὲν ἐν ἀπορρήτοις περὶ αὐτῶν λεγόμενος λόγος, ὡς ἔν τινι φρουρᾶι ἐσμεν ’ (Φαίδων Πλάτωνος 62 b fr. 7)· 

And of this story, it is exactly right, because it began from the God, at the point where he was saying, ‘The account spoken of in the Mysteries, that we are in a prison’ (Φαίδων Πλάτωνος 62 b fr. 7); 

καὶ εἰς θεὸν κατέληξεν, ἐξ οὗ καὶ ἤρξατο, λέγω δὲ τὸν Διόνυσον.

it also ended with the God from whom it began, and this I say is Diónysos!”
