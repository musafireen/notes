Κατ ἐκεῖνον τὸν καιρὸν ἦμεν πάντες οἱ ἀπόστολοι ἐν Ἰεροσολύμοις, Σίμων ὁ λεγόμενος Πέτρος καὶ Ἀνδρέας ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ, Ἰάκωβος ὁ τοῦ Ζεβεδαίου καὶ Ἰωάννης ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ, Φίλιππος καὶ Βαρθολομαῖος, Θωμᾶς καὶ Ματθαῖος ὁ τελώνης, Ἰάκωβος Ἁλφαίου καὶ Σίμων ὁ Καναναῖος,
καὶ Ἰούδας Ἰακώβου, καὶ διείλαμεν τὰ κλίματα τῆς οἰκουμένης, ὅπως εἷς ἕκαστος ἡμῶν ἐν τῷ κλίματι τῷ λαχόντι αὐτῷ καὶ εἰς τὸ ἔθνος ἐν ᾧ ὁ κύριος αὐτὸν ἀπέστειλεν πο ρευθῇ. κατὰ κλῆρον οὖν ἔλαχεν ἡ Ἰνδία Ἰούδᾳ Θωμᾷ τῷ καὶ Διδύμῳ· οὐκ ἐβούλετο δὲ ἀπελθεῖν, λέγων μὴ δύνασθαι μήτε χωρεῖν διὰ τὴν ἀσθένειαν τῆς σαρκός, καὶ ὅτι Ἄνθρωπος ὢν Ἑβραῖος πῶς δύναμαι πορευθῆναι ἐν τοῖς Ἰνδοῖς κηρύξαι τὴν ἀλήθειαν; Καὶ ταῦτα αὐτοῦ διαλογιζομένου καὶ λέγοντος ὤφθη αὐτῷ ὁ σωτὴρ διὰ τῆς νυκτός, καὶ λέγει αὐτῷ· Μὴ φοβοῦ Θωμᾶ, ἄπελθε εἰς τὴν Ἰνδίαν καὶ κήρυξον ἐκεῖ τὸν λόγον· ἡ γὰρ χάρις μού ἐστιν μετὰ σοῦ. Ὃ δὲ οὐκ ἐπείθετο,
λέγων· Ὅπου βούλει με ἀποστεῖλαι ἀπόστειλον ἀλλαχοῦ· εἰς Ἰνδοὺς γὰρ οὐκ ἀπέρχομαι.


The First Act, when he went into India with Abbanes the merchant.

At that season all we the apostles were at Jerusalem, Simon which is called Peter and Andrew his brother, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew the publican, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Canaanite, and Judas the brother of James: and we divided the regions of the world, that every one of us should go unto the region that fell to him and unto the nation whereunto the Lord sent him.

According to the lot, therefore, India fell unto Judas Thomas, which is also the twin: but he would not go, saying that by reason of the weakness of the flesh he could not travel, and I am an Hebrew man; how can I go amongst the Indians and preach the truth? And as he thus reasoned and spake, the Saviour appeared unto him by night and saith to him: Fear not, Thomas, go thou unto India and preach the word there, for my grace is with thee. But he would not obey, saying: Whither thou wouldest send me, send me, but elsewhere, for unto the Indians I will not go.

Καὶ ταῦτα αὐτοῦ λέγοντος καὶ ἐνθυμουμένου ἔτυχεν ἔμπορόν τινα εἶναι ἐκεῖ ἀπὸ τῆς Ἰνδίας ἐλθόντα ᾧ ὄνομα Ἀββάνης, ἀπὸ τοῦ βασιλέως Γουνδαφόρου ἀποσταλέντα καὶ ἐντολὴν παρ αὐτοῦ εἰληφότα τέκτονα πριάμενον ἀγαγεῖν αὐτῷ. ὁ δὲ κύριος ἰδὼν αὐτὸν ἐν τῇ ἀγορᾷ περιπατοῦντα τὸ μεσημβρινὸν εἶπεν αὐτῷ· Βούλει τέκτονα πρίασθαι; Ὃ δὲ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· Ναι. Καὶ ὁ κύριος ἔφη αὐτῷ· Ἔχω δοῦλον τέκτονα καὶ βούλομαι αὐτὸν πωλῆσαι. Καὶ ταῦτα εἰπὼν ὑπέδειξεν αὐτῷ τὸν Θωμᾶν ἀπὸ μακρόθεν, καὶ συνεφώνησεν

μεταὐτοῦ τριῶν λιτρῶν ἀσήμου, καὶ ἔγραψεν ὠνὴν λέγων· Ἐγὼ Ἰησοῦς υἱὸς Ἰωσήφ τοῦ τέκτονος ὁμολογῶ πεπρακέναι ἐμὸν δοῦλον Ἰούδαν ὀνόματι σοὶ τῷ Ἀββάνῃ ἐμπόρῳ Γουνδαφόρου τοῦ βασιλέως τῶν Ἰνδῶν. Τῆς δὲ ὠνῆς τελεσθείσης ὁ σωτὴρ παραλαβὼν Ἰούδαν τὸν καὶ Θωμᾶν ἀπήγαγεν πρὸς Ἀββάνην τὸν ἔμπορον· καὶ ἰδὼν αὐτὸν ὁ Ἀββάνης εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτόν· Οὖτός ἐστιν ὁ δεσπότης σου; Καὶ ἀποκριθεὶς ὁ ἀπόστολος εἶπεν· Ναί, κύριός μού ἐστιν. Ὃ δέ φησιν· Ἠγόρασά σε παρ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ὁ ἀπόστολος ἡσύχαζεν.

And while he thus spake and thought, it chanced that there was there a certain merchant come from India whose name was Abbanes, sent from the King Gundaphorus,1 [*]and having commandment from him to buy a carpenter and bring him unto him.

Now the Lord seeing him walking in the market-place at noon said unto him: Wouldest thou buy a carpenter? And he said to him: Yea. And the Lord said to him: I have a slave that is a carpenter and I desire to sell him. And so saying he showed him Thomas afar off, and agreed with him for three litrae of silver unstamped, and wrote a deed of sale, saying: I, Jesus, the son of Joseph the carpenter, acknowledge that I have sold my slave, Judas by name, unto thee Abbanes, a merchant of Gundaphorus, king of the Indians. And when the deed was finished, the Saviour took Judas Thomas and led him away to Abbanes the merchant; and when Abbanes saw him he said unto him: Is this thy master? And the apostle said: Yea, he is my Lord. And he said: I have bought thee of him. And the apostle held his peace.
### 3
Τῇ δὲ ἑξῆς ὄρθρου εὐξάμενος καὶ δεηθεὶς τοῦ κυρίου εἶπεν ὁ ἀπόστολος· Πορεύομαι ὅπου βούλει κύριε Ἰησοῦ· τὸ

θέληματὸ σὸν γενέσθω. Ἀπῆλθεν δὲ πρὸς Ἀββάνην τὸν ἔμπορον μηδὲν ὅλως τι μεθ ἑαυτοῦ κομισάμενος ἀλλ ἢ τὸ τίμημα αὐτοῦ μόνον. δεδώκει γὰρ αὐτῷ ὁ κύριος λέγων· Ἥτω μετὰ σοῦ καὶ ἡ τιμή σου μετὰ τῆς χάριτός μου ὅπου ἂν ἀπέρχῃ. Κατέλαβεν δὲ ὁ ἀπόστολος τὸν Ἀββάνην ἴσως τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ ἀναφέροντα εἰς τὸ πλοῖον· ἤρξατο οὖν καὶ αὐτὸς συναναφέρειν αὐτῷ. ἐμβάντων δὲ αὐτῶν εἰς τὸ πλοῖον καὶ καθεσθέντων ἐξήταζεν ὁ Ἀββάνης τὸν ἀπόστολον λέγων· Ποίαν ἐργασίαν οἶδας; Ὃ δὲ ἔφη· Ἐν μὲν ξύλοις ἄροτρα καὶ ζυγοὺς καὶ τρυτάνας καὶ πλοῖα καὶ κώπας πλοίων καὶ ἱστοὺς καὶ τροχίσκους, ἐν δὲ λίθοις στήλας τε καὶ ναοὺς καὶ πραιτώρια
βασιλικά. Εἶπεν δὲ αὐτῷ ὁ Ἁββάνης ὁ ἔμπορος· Τοιούτου γὰρ καὶ χρείαν ἔχομεν τεχνίτου. Ἤρξαντο οὖν καταπλέειν· ἔσχον δὲ ἐπιτήδειον ἄνεμον, καὶ προθύμως ἔπλεον ἕως ὅτε κατήντησαν εἰς Ἀνδράπολιν, πόλιν βασιλικήν.

And on the day following the apostle arose early, and having prayed and besought the Lord he said: I will go whither thou wilt, Lord Jesus; thy will be done. And he departed unto Abbanes the merchant, taking with him nothing at all save only his price. For the Lord had given it unto him, saying: Let

thy price also be with thee, together with my grace, wheresoever thou goest.
And the apostle found Abbanes carrying his baggage on board the ship; so he also began to carry it aboard with him. And when they were embarked in the ship and were set down, Abbanes questioned the apostle, saying: What craftsmanship knowest thou? And he said: In wood I can make ploughs and yokes and augers [*], and boats and oars for boats and masts and pulleys; and in stone, pillars and temples and court-houses for kings. And Abbanes the merchant said to him: Yea, it is of such a workman that we have need. They began then to sail homeward; and they had a favourable wind, and sailed prosperously till they reached Andrapolis, a royal city.
### 4
Ἐξελθόντες δὲ ἀπὸ τοῦ πλοίου εἰσῄεσαν εἰς τὴν πόλιν. καὶ ἰδοὺ φωναὶ αὐλητῶν καὶ ὑδραύλεων καὶ σάλπιγγες περιηχοῦσαι αὐτούς· ἐξήταζεν δὲ ὁ ἀπόστολος λέγων· Τίς ἐστιν αὕτη ἡ ἑορτὴ ἡ ἐν τῇ πόλει ταύτῃ; Ἔλεγον δὲ αὐτῷ οἱ ἐκεῖ

ὅτιΚαὶ σὲ οἱ θεοὶ ἤγαγον ἵνα εὐωχηθῇς ἐν τῇ πόλει ταύτῃ. ὁ γὰρ βασιλεὺς θυγατέρα μονογενῆ ἔχει, καὶ νῦν αὐτὴν ἐκδίδωσιν ἀνδρὶ πρὸς γάμον· τῶν οὖν γάμων ἡ χαρὰ καὶ ἡ πανήγυρίς ἐστιν αὕτη σήμερον ἣν εἶδες ἑορτήν. ὁ δὲ βασιλεὺς κήρυκας ἀπέστειλεν κηρύξαι πανταχοῦ πάντας παρατυχεῖν εἰς τοὺς γάμους, πλουσίους τε καὶ πένητας, δούλους τε καὶ ἐλευθέρους, ξένους τε καὶ πολίτας· εἴ τις δὲ παραιτήσηται καὶ μὴ παρατύχῃ εἰς τοὺς γάμους, ὑπεύθυνος ἔσται τῷ βασιλεῖ. Ἀββάνης δὲ ἀκούσας εἶπεν τῷ ἀποστόλῳ· Ἀπέλθωμεν οὖν καὶ ἡμεῖς, ἵνα μὴ προσκρούσωμεν τῷ βασιλεῖ, καὶ μάλιστα ξένοι ὄντες. Ὃ δὲ εἶπεν· Ἀπέλθωμεν. Καταλύσαντες δὲ ἐν τῷ ξενοδοχείῳ καὶ ὀλίγον ἀναπαέντες ἀπῆλθον εἰς τοὺς γάμους.
καὶἰδὼν ὁ ἀπόστολος ἀνακεκλιμένους πάντας ἀνεκλίθη καὶ αὐτὸς ἐν τῷ μέσῳ· ἀπέβλεπον δὲ εἰς αὐτὸν πάντες ὡς εἰς ξένον καὶ ἐξ ἀλλοδαπῆς ἐλθόντα γῆς· Ἀββάνης δὲ ὁ ἔμπορος ὡς ἅτε δεσπότης εἰς ἄλλον τόπον ἀνεκλίθη.

And they left the ship and entered into the city, and lo, there were noises of flutes and water-organs, and trumpets sounded about them; and the apostle inquired, saying: What is this festival that is in this city? And they that were there said to him: Thee also have the gods brought to make merry in this city. For the king hath an only daughter, and now he giveth her in marriage unto an husband: this rejoicing, therefore, and assembly of the wedding to-day is the festival which thou hast seen. And the king hath sent heralds to proclaim everywhere that all should come to the marriage, rich and poor, bond and free, strangers and citizens: and if any refuse and come not to the marriage he shall answer for it unto the king. And Abbanes hearing that, said to the apostle: Let us also go, lest we offend the king, especially seeing we are strangers. And he said: Let us go.

And after they had put up in the inn and rested a little space they went to the marriage; and the apostle seeing them all set down (reclining), laid himself, he also, in the midst, and all looked upon him, as upon a stranger and one come from a foreign land: but Abbanes the merchant, being his master, laid himself in another place.
### 11
Ὁ δὲ βασιλεὺς ἠξίου τοὺς παρανύμφους ἐξέρχεσθαι ἀπὸ τοῦ νυμφῶνος. πάντων δὲ ἐξελθόντων καὶ τῶν θυρῶν κλεισθεισῶν ὁ νυμφίος τὸ καταπέτασμα τοῦ νυμφῶνος ἐπῆρεν,

ἵνα τὴν νύμφην πρὸς ἑαυτὸν ἀγάγῃ. καὶ εἶδεν τὸν κύριον Ἰησοῦν τὴν ἀπεικασίαν Ἰούδα Θωμᾶ ἔχοντα καὶ ὁμιλοῦντα τῇ νύμφῃ, τοῦ πρὸ βραχέως εὐλογήσαντος αὐτοὺς καὶ ἐξελθόντος ἀπ αὐτῶν, τοῦ ἀποστόλου, καί φησιν αὐτῷ· Ὀυχὶ πρὸ πάντων ἐξῆλθες; πῶς νῦν εὑρέθης ὧδε; Ὁ δὲ κύριος εἶπεν αὐτῷ· Ἐγὼ οὐκ εἰμὶ Ἰούδας ὁ καὶ Θωμᾶς, ἀδελφὸς δὲ αὐτοῦ εἰμι. Καὶ ἐκαθέσθη ὁ κύριος ἐπὶ τῆς κλίνης, ἐκέλευσεν δὲ καὶ αὐτοῖς καθεσθῆναι ἐπὶ τοῖς δίφροις, καὶ ἤρξατο αὐτοῖς λέγειν·

And the king desired the groomsmen to depart out of the bride-chamber; and when all were gone out and the doors were shut, the bridegroom lifted up the curtain of the bride-chamber to fetch the bride unto him. And he saw the Lord Jesus bearing the likeness of Judas Thomas and speaking with the bride— even of him that but now had blessed them and gone out from them, the apostle; and he saith unto him: Wentest thou not out in the sight of all? how then art thou found here? But the Lord said to him: I am not Judas which is also called Thomas, but I am his brother. And the Lord sat down upon the bed and bade them also sit upon chairs, and began to say unto them:
### 16
Ἀκούσας δὲ ὁ βασιλεὺς παρὰ τοῦ νυμφίου καὶ τῆς νύμφης ταῦτα, τὴν ἐσθῆτα αὐτοῦ διέρρηξεν καὶ τοῖς παρεστῶσιν αὐτῷ ἐγγὺς αὐτοῦ ἔλεγεν· Ἐξέλθατε ταχέως καὶ περιέλθατε ὅλην τὴν πόλιν, καὶ συλλαβόντες φέρετέ μοι ἐκεῖνον τὸν ἄνδρα τὸν φαρμακὸν τὸν κακῶς παρατυχόντα ἐν τῇ πόλει ταύτῃ· ἐγὼ γὰρ εἰσήγαγον αὐτὸν ἰδίαις χερσὶν εἰς τὸν οἶκόν μου, καὶ ἐγὼ εἶπον αὐτῷ ἵνα εὔξηται ἐπὶ τῇ ἀτυχεστάτῃ μου θυγατρί· ὃς δ ἂν εὑρὼν αὐτὸν προσαγάγῃ μοι, πᾶν εἴ τι ἂν

αἰτήσηταίμοι, δίδωμι αὐτῷ. Ἀπελθόντες οὖν περιῆλθον ζητοῦντες αὐτόν, καὶ οὐχ εὗρον αὐτόν· πλεύσας γὰρ ἦν. ἀπῆλθον δὲ καὶ εἰς τὸ ξενοδοχεῖον ὅπου ἦν καταλύσας, καὶ εὗρον ἐκεῖ τὴν αὐλήτριαν κλαίουσαν καὶ ἀνιωμένην, ἐπειδὴ μὴ παρέλαβεν αὐτὴν μεθ ἑαυτοῦ. ἐξηγησαμένων δὲ αὐτῇ τὸ πρᾶγμα τὸ γεγονὸς ἐπὶ τῶν νεωτέρων ἐχάρη πάνυ ἀκούσασα, καὶ ἀποθεμένη τὴν λύπην εἶπεν· Νῦν εὗρον κἀγὼ ὧδε ἀνάπαυσιν. Καὶ ἀναστᾶσα ἀπῆλθεν πρὸς αὐτούς, καὶ ἦν σὺν αὐτοῖς χρόνον ἱκανόν, ἕως οὗ κατήχησαν καὶ τὸν βασιλέα. πολλοὶ δὲ καὶ τῶν ἀδελφῶν συνηθροίζοντο ἐκεῖ, ἕως ὅτε φήμης ἥκουσαν
τοῦἀποστόλου, ὅτι ἐν ταῖς πόλεσιν τῆς Ἰνδίας κατήχθη καὶ ἐκεῖ διδάσκει. καὶ ἀπελθόντες κατεμίγησαν αὐτῷ.
πράξεις Θωμᾶ ἀποστόλου. περὶ τῆς πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα Γουνδαφόρον εἰσελεύσεως αὐτοῦ.

Now when the king heard these things from the bridegroom and the bride, he rent his clothes and said unto them that stood by him: Go forth quickly and go about the whole city, and take and bring me that man that is a sorcerer who by ill fortune came unto this city; for with mine own hands I brought him into this house, and I told him to pray over this mine ill-starred daughter; and whoso findeth and bringeth him to me, I will give him whatsoever he asketh of me. They went, therefore, and went about seeking him, and found him not; for he had set sail. They went also unto the inn where he had lodged and found there the flute-girl weeping and afflicted because he had not taken her with him. And when they told her the matter that had befallen with the young people she was exceeding glad at hearing it, and put away her grief and said: Now have I also found rest here. And she rose up and went unto them, and was with them a long time, until they had instructed the king also. And many of the brethren also gathered there until they heard the report of the apostle, that he was come unto the cities of India and was teaching there: and they departed and joined themselves unto him.
### 17
Ὅτε δὲ εἰσῆλθεν ὁ ἀπόστολος εἰς τὰς πόλεις τῆς Ἰνδίας μετὰ Ἀββάνη τοῦ ἐμπόρου, ἀπῆλθεν ὁ Ἀββάνης εἰς ἀσπασμὸν Γουνδαφόρου τοῦ βασιλέως, προσανήνεγκεν δὲ αὐτῷ περὶ τοῦ τέκτονος ὃν μετ αὐτοῦ ἤγαγεν. ἐχάρη δὲ ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ πρὸς αὐτὸν εἰσελθεῖν αὐτὸν προσέταξεν. εἰσελθόντος

οὖν αὐτοῦ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ βασιλεύς· Ποίαν τέχνην ἐπίστασαι; Λέγει αὐτῷ ὁ ἀπόστολος· Τὴν τεκτονικὴν καὶ τὴν οἰκοδομικήν. Λέγει αὐτῷ ὁ βασιλεύς· Τίνα οὖν οἶδας ἐν ξύλοις ἐργασίαν, καὶ τίνα ἐν λίθοις; Λέγει ὁ ἀπόστολος· Ἐν μὲν ξύλοις ἄροτρα ζυγοὺς τρυτάνας τροχιλέας καὶ πλοῖα καὶ κώπας καὶ ἱστούς, ἐν δὲ λίθοις στήλας ναοὺς καὶ πραιτώρια βασιλικά. Καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς εἶπεν· Οἰκοδομεῖς μοι παλάτιον; Ὃ δὲ ἀπεκρίθη· Ναί, οἰκοδομῶ καὶ τελίσκω· διὰ τοῦτο γὰρ ἦλθον, οἰκοδομῆσαι καὶ τεκτονεῦσαι.

The Second Act: concerning his coming unto the king Gundaphorus.

Now when the apostle was come into the cities of India with Abbanes the merchant, Abbanes went to salute the king Gundaphorus, and reported to him of the carpenter whom he had brought with him. And the king was glad, and commanded him to come in to him. So when he was come in the king said unto him: What craft understandest thou? The apostle said unto him: The craft of carpentering and of building. The king saith unto him: What craftsmanship, then, knowest thou in wood, and what in stone? The apostle saith: In wood: ploughs, yokes, goads, pulleys, and boats and oars and masts; and in stone: pillars, temples, and court-houses for kings. And the king said: Canst thou build me a palace? And he answered: Yea, I can both build and furnish it; for to this end am I come, to build and to do the work of a carpenter.

Πρᾶξις ε περὶ τοῦ δαίμονος τοῦ ἐνοικήσαντος εἰς τὴν γυναῖκα.
(39) Εἰσῆλθεν δὲ ὁ ἀπόστολος εἰς τὴν πόλιν τοῦ παντὸς ὄχλου ἀκολουθοῦντος αὐτῷ· ἐσκέπτετο δὲ ἀπελθεῖν πρὸς τοὺς γονεῖς τοῦ νεωτέρου ὃν ἐζωοποίησεν θανόντα ὑπὸ τοῦ δράκοντος· πάνυ γὰρ ἐδέοντο αὐτοῦ παραγενέσθαι πρὸς αὐτοὺς καὶ εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτῶν. γυνὴ δέ τις πάνυ ὡραία αἰφνιδίως φωνὴν ἀφῆκε μεγίστην λέγουσα·

Ἀπόστολε τοῦ νέου θεοῦ ὁ ἐλθὼν εἰς τὴν Ἰνδίαν, καὶ δοῦλε τοῦ ἁγίου ἐκείνου καὶ μόνου ἀγαθοῦ θεοῦ· διὰ σοῦ γὰρ οὗτος κηρύσσεται ὁ σωτὴρ τῶν ψυχῶν τῶν πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐρχομένων, καὶ διὰ σοῦ ἰατρεύεται τὰ σώματα τῶν ὑπὸ τοῦ ἐχθροῦ κολαζομένων, καὶ σὺ εἶ ὁ γεγονὼς πρόφασις τῆς ζωῆς πάντων τῶν ἐπ αὐτὸν ἐπιστρεφόντων· κέλευσόν με ἀχθῆναι ἔμπροσθέν σου ἵνα σοι ἀφηγήσωμαι τὰ συμβάντα μοι καὶ τάχα ἐκ σοῦ γένηταί μοι ἐλπίς, καὶ οὗτοι δὲ οἱ παρεστῶτές

σοιεὐέλπιδες γένωνται μᾶλλον εἰς τὸν θεὸν ὅν κηρύσσεις. οὐ μικρῶς γὰρ βασανίζομαι ὑπὸ τοῦ ἐναντίου ἤδη χρόνου πενταχρᾶτό ετοῦς ἐνεστῶτος. ὡς γυνὴ ἐκαθεζόμην ἐν ἡσυχίᾳ τὸ πρότερον, καὶ πανταχόθεν με εἰρήνη περιεῖχεν, καὶ οὐδενὸς μέριμναν ἐποιούμην· οὐδὲ γὰρ ἄλλου τινὸς φροντίδα εἶχον.

The Fifth Act: concerning the devil that took up his abode in the woman

And the apostle entered into the city and all the multitude followed him. And he thought to go unto the parents of the young man whom he had made alive when he was slain by the serpent; for they earnestly besought him to come unto them and enter into their house. But a very beautiful woman on a sudden uttered an exceeding loud cry, saying: O Apostle of the new God that art come into India, and servant of that holy and only good God; for by thee is he preached, the Saviour of the souls that come unto him, and by thee are healed the bodies of them that are tormented by the enemy, and thou art he that is become an occasion of life unto all that turn unto him: command me to be brought before thee that I may tell thee what hath befallen me, and peradventure of thee I may have hope, and these that stand by thee may be more confident in the God whom thou preachest. For I am not a little tormented by the adversary now this five years’ space [*] I was sitting at the first in quiet, and peace encompassed me on every side and I had no care for anything, for I took no thought for any other.
### 62
Πρᾶξις ζ περὶ τοῦ στρατηλάτου.
Τοῦ δὲ ἀποστόλου Ἰούδα Θωμᾶ καταγγέλλοντος ἐν πάσῃ τῇ Ἰνδίᾳ τὸν λόγον τοῦ θεοῦ στρατηλάτης τις τοῦ βασιλέως Μισδαίου ἦλθεν πρὸς αὐτόν, καὶ ἔλεγεν αὐτῷ· Ἀκήκοα περὶ σοῦ ὅτι μισθὸν παρά τινος οὐ λαμβάνεις, ἀλλ ὅπερ καὶ ἔχεις τοῖς δεομένοις παρέχεις· εἰ γὰρ μισθοὺς ἐλάμβανες, ἀπέστειλα ἂν χρῆμα ἱκανόν, καὶ αὐτὸς ἐνθάδε οὐ παρεγενόμην· ὁ γὰρ βασιλεὺς ἐκτὸς ἐμοῦ οὐδὲν διαπράττεται· πολλὰ γὰρ ὑπάρχοντά μοί εἰσιν καὶ πλούσιός εἰμι, εἷς τῶν

ἐντῇ Ἰνδίᾳ· καὶ οὐδ ὅλως ἠδίκησά ποτέ τινα· τὸ δὲ ἐναντίον μοι συνέβη· γαμετὴν ἔχω, καὶ ἔσχον ἐξ αὐτῆς θυγατέρα, καὶ πάνυ διάκειμαι πρὸς αὐτήν, ὡς καὶ ἡ φύσις ἀπαιτεῖ, ἄλλης δὲ γυναικὸς οὐ πεπείραμαι. ἔτυχεν δὲ γάμον γενέσθαι ἐν τῇ ἡμετέρᾳ πόλει, καὶ πάνυ μοι προσφιλεῖς ἦσαν οἱ τὸν γάμον ποιοῦντες· εἰσελθόντες οὖν ἠξίουν με καλοῦντες αὐτὴν καὶ τὴν θυγατέρα αὐτῆς. ἐπεὶ οὖν πάνυ μοι φίλοι ἦσαν, οὐκ ἠδυνήθην παραιτήσασθαι· ἀπέστειλα οὖν αὐτὴν καίπερ μὴ βουλομένην ἀπελθεῖν, πολλοὺς δὲ καὶ οἰκέτας συναπέστειλα αὐταῖς. ἀπῄεσαν οὖν κόσμον πολὺν κεκοσμημέναι αὐτὴ καὶ ἡ θυγάτηρ αὐτῆς·

The Seventh Act: of the Captain.

Now while the apostle Thomas was proclaiming throughout all India the word of God, a certain captain of the king Misdaeus [*] came to him and said unto him: I have heard of thee that thou takest no reward of any man, but even that thou hast thou givest to them that need. For if thou didst receive rewards, I would have sent thee a great sum, and would not have come myself, for the king doeth nought without me: for I have much substance and am rich, even one of the rich men of India. And I have never done wrong to any; but the contrary hath befallen me. I have a wife, and of her I had a daughter, and I am well affectioned toward her, as also nature requireth, and have never made trial of another wife. Now it chanced that there was a wedding in our city, and they that made the marriage feast were well beloved of me: they came in therefore and bade

me to it, bidding also my wife and her daughter. Forasmuch then as they were my good friends I could not refuse: I sent her therefore, though she desired not to go, and with them I sent also many servants: so they departed, both she and her daughter, decked with many ornaments.
