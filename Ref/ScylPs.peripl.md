Past Caria is Lycia, a nation: and the Lycians have the following cities: Telmissos with a harbor and the river Xanthos, with a voyage upstream to (Xanthos, a city): Patera, a city with a harbor; Phellos, a city with a harbor; off these places is an island of the Rhodians, Megiste; Limyra, a city, to which the voyage is up the river. Then Gagaia, a city; then the Chelidoniai, a promontory with two islands; and Dionysias island; the promontory and harbor of Siderous. Beyond this is a sanctuary of Hephaistos in the mountain, and much spontaneous fire burns out of the ground and never goes out.
If you proceed upward from the sea there is (then) Phaselis, a city with a harbor — and this is a gulf; and Idyros, a city; the island of Lyrnateia; Olbia; Magydos with the river Katarraktes; Perge, a city with a sanctuary of Artemis. The direct coastal voyage along Lycia from Caria is a day and a night; because it is indented, the way along the land is double this.

After Arabia is the nation of Egypt, with the following cities: Pelousion city and harbor and palace, where first is the Pelousiac mouth of the Nile river, the border of Arabia. Second is the Tanitic (mouth), on which is a royal city. Third is the Mendesian and the city of Mendes. Fourth is the Phatnitic; fifth the Sebennytic and the city Sebennytos; the lake Boutos, where is a city and palace. Sixth the Bolbitic and the royal city; seventh the [Kanopic and Thonis city and harbor. After this a lake] called [Mareotis] ... the Pelousiac. And again it splits in two; the Sebennytic partly to the Mendesian, partly to the sea. From the Mendesian to the Phatnitic mouth; from the Pelousiac to the Tanitic mouth; from the Kanopic to the Sebennytic lake; and the Bolbitinic flows from the lake. There are many lakes and swamps by the sea of Egypt. Egypt is similar in form to an axe, for it is wide by the sea, narrower inland, narrowest by Memphis; then it gets wider going inland from Memphis, and widest up above. The part of Egypt above Memphis is three times the size of the part along the sea. The Kanopic mouth divides Asia from Libya. The coastal voyage along Egypt from the Pelousiac mouth is 1300 stades. The circumnavigation of Asia, for it has a closed perimeter, calculating in the same way as is written for Europe, is 87 days. At the Kanopic mouth is a desert island named Kanopos and a point in it of Menelaus, the memorial of his helmsman from Troy, whose name was Kanopos. The Egyptians and the locals of these places both say that Pelousion reaches to Kasion and Kanopos reaches to the island where the helmsman's memorial is.

The city of the Barkaians is 100 stades distant from the sea. From the harbor by Barka to Hesperides is 620 stades. From Kyrene are harbors and places split from Hesperides as follows; the gulf of Phykos. Above here is the garden of the Hesperides. This place is 18 fathoms deep, steep all around, with no descent. It is not less than two stades on all sides, width and length. This is shadowed by trees entangled in each other, as thickly as possible. The trees are lotos, all kinds of apple, pomegranate, pear, strawberry tree, mulberry, vine, myrtle, laurel, ivy, olive, wild olive, almond, chestnut.

The Nasamones live around here, a Libyan nation, as far as the inmost part on the left. Next to them are the Makai, a Libyan nation, besides Syrtis until the mouth of Syrtis. Sailing into Syrtis from Hesperides are the Herakleia Thines. Next to them is Drepanon, the three Pontiai islands and the so-called Leukai. In the deepest part of Syrtis are the altars of the Philainoi, a port, the grove of Ammon.

From Thapsos to Leptis Minor; from Leptis to Adrymeton; From Thapsos and Leptis Minor and Adrymeton is a large gulf in which is the small Syrtis, called Kerkinitis, much more difficult and harder to navigate than the other Syrtis, with a circumference of 2000 stades. In this Syrtis was the island and lake called Tritonis and the river Triton, hence the sanctuary of Athena Tritonis. The lake has a small mouth with an island against it, and when the tide is low sometimes the lake seems not to have an entry. This lake is large with a circumference of about 1000 stades. The Gyzantes Libyans live around it, a nation, with a city to the west. For these Gyzantes Libyans are said to be all blond and handsome.

From Carthage with the best sailing the coastal voyage to here is seven days and nights. These are islands toward Europe, and one of them has a city, and the Pillars of Herakles are near them, the Libyan one low, the European one high. These are promontories opposite one another, a day's sail apart. The coastal voyage along Libya from the Canopic mouth in Egypt to the Pillars of Herakles, using the same calculation as has been written for Asia and Europe, sailing a curved course following the gulfs is 74 days. All the towns or trading posts listed, in Libya from the Syrtis by the Hesperides to the Pillar of Herakles in Libya, are Carthaginian.

After the pillars of Herakles sailing outwards with Libya on the left, there is a large gulf until the Hermaian promontory. For there is a Hermaian promontory here as well. At the middle of the gulf is the place of the Pontians and a city. Around the city lies a large lake, and in this lake are many islands. Around the lake grow reed and marsh grass and tufted reed and rushes. The Meleagrid birds are here and nowhere else, unless someone exports them from there. The name of the lake is Kefesias, and of the gulf Kotes. It is between the pillars of Herakles and the Hermaian promontory. From the Hermaian promontory large shoals stretch indeed from Libya to Europe, not protruding from the sea; in some places it washes over them. The shoal reaches to the other promontory of Europe opposite, namely the Sacred Promontory. After the Hermaian promontory is the river Anides, which flows out into a large lake. After Anides is another large river, Lixos, and a Phoenician city Lixos, and another city of the Libyans beyond the river, with a harbor. After Lixos, Krathis river and harbor and a city of the Phoenicians named Thymiateria. After Thymiateria is the voyage to the Soloeis promontory, which extends far out to sea. Of all Libya this is the most famous and holiest country. At the tip of the promontory is a grand altar of Poseidon. Carved on the altar are men, women, lions, dolphins. They say Daidalos made it. From Soloeis promontory is a river named Lixos. Around this river dwell the sacred Ethiopians. Off here is an island named Kerne. The coastal voyage from the pillars of Herakles to the Hermaian promontory is two days. From the Hermaian promontory to Soloeis promontory is three days. From Soloeis to Kerne is seven days. All this coastal voyage then from the pillars of Herakles to Kerne island is twelve days. Beyond Kerne it is no longer navigable because of shallow seas and clay and seaweed. The seaweed is a hand's width and sharp above, so it pricks. The merchants are Phoenicians; when they come to Kerne island they anchor their merchant ships offshore and make shelters for themselves on Kerne. Unloading the cargo they bring it to the mainland in small boats. The Ethiopians are on the mainland and it is the Ethiopians for whom the goods are disposed. They sell in exchange for skins of deer and lion and leopard and elephant skin and teeth and tame flocks. The Ethiopians used mottled hides for ornament and ivory cups and goblets, and their women wear ivory bracelets as ornaments, and they use ivory ornaments on their horses. These Ethiopians are the tallest of all people we know, taller than four cubits (185 cm) and some of them are five cubits (230 cm), bearded and long-haired and handsomest of all people. They are ruled by whichever of them is the tallest. They are horse-drivers and javelin-throwers and bowmen and use fire-hardened arrows. The Phoenician merchants import to them myrrh, Egyptian stone, other mined stones, Attic pottery and earth. For figurines are the main merchandise at the Pitcher festival. These Ethiopians are meat-eaters, milk-drinkers, they drink a lot of wine from vineyards, which the Phoenicians bring. They have a large city to which the Phoenician merchants sail. Some say that these Ethiopians are settled continuously from there to Egypt and this sea is continuous, and Libya is its coast.
