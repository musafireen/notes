“Τοὺς δ’ οὖν κατ’ Αἴγυπτον ἀνθρώπους τὸ
παλαιὸν γενομένους ἀναβλέψαντας εἰς τὸν κόσμον, καὶ τὴν τῶν ὅλων φύσιν καταπλαγέντας τε καὶ θαυμάσαντας,

c
ὑπολαβεῖν εἶναι δύο θεοὺς ἀïδίους τε καὶ πρώτους, τόν τε ἤλιον καὶ τὴν σελήνην, ὧν τὸν μὲν Ὄσιριν, τὴν δὲ Ἰσιν ὀνομάσαι, ἀπό τινος ἐτύμου τεθείσης
ἑκατέρας τὴς προσηγοοίας.

[DIODORUS] 'It is said then that the men who dwelled of old in Egypt when they looked up to the cosmos, and were struck with astonishment and admiration at the nature of the universe, supposed that the sun and moon were two eternal and primal gods, one of whom they named Osiris, and the other Isis, each name being applied from some true etymology.
#### 2
υεθερμηνευομένων γὰρ τούτων εἰς τὸν Ελληνικὸν τῆς διαλέκτου τρόπον εἶναι μὲν τὸν Ὂσιριν πολυόφθλμον, εἰκότως· πάντη γὰρ ἐπιβαλλοντα τὰς ἀκτῖνας ὡσπερ πολλοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς βλέπειν ἂπασαν γῆν καὶ θάλατταν· καὶ
τὸν ποιητὴν δὲ λέγειν σύμφωνα τούτοις, [*]

v.1.p.33
Ἠέλιός θ’ ὃς πάντ’ ἐφορᾷς καὶ πάντ’ ἐπακούεις.

'For when they are translated into the Greek form of speech, Osiris is "many eyed"; with reason, for casting his beams in every direction he beholds, as it were with many eyes, the whole earth and sea: and with this the poet's words agree:
#### 3
τῶν δὲ παρ’ Ἓλλησι παλαιῶν μυθολόγων τινὲς

d
τὸν Ὄσιριν Διόνυσον προσονομάζουσι καὶ Σείριον παρωνύμως. ὧν Εὔμολπος μὲν ἐν τοῖς Βακχικοῖς
ἔπεσί φησιν
ἀστροφαῆ Διόνυσον ἐν ἀκτίνεσσι πυρωπόν.
Ὀρφεὺς δὲ
τοὔνεκά μιν καλέουσι Φάνητά τε καὶ Διόνυσον.

φασὶ δέ τινες καὶ τὸ ἔναμμα αὐτῷ τὸ τῆς νεβρίδος ἀπὸ τῆς τῶν ἄστρων ποικιλίας περιῆφθαι.

Thou Sun, who all things seest, and nearest all." 12

'But some of the ancient mythologists among the Greeks give to Osiris the additional name Dionysus, and, by a slight change in the name, Sirius. One of these, Eumolpus, speaks in his Bacchic poems thus:

                                                "Dionysus named, 
"Bright as a star, his face aflame with rays." 13

And Orpheus says:

"For that same cause Phanes and Dionysus him they call."14

Some say also that the fawn-skin cloak is hung about him as a representation of the spangling of the stars.
#### 4
τὴν δὲ Ἰσιν μεθερμηνευομένη εἶναι παλαιὰν, τεθειμένης τῆς προσηγορίας τῇ σελήνῃ ἀπὸ τῆς ἀιδίου καὶ παλαιᾶς γενέσεως· κέρατα δ’ αὐτῇ περιτιθέασιν ἀπό τε
τῆς ὄψεως, ἣν ἔχουσα φαίνεται καθ’ ὃν ἂν χρόνον ὑπάρχῃ μηνοειδὴς, καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς καθιερωμένης αὐτῇ

28
βοὸς παρ’ Αἰγυπτίοις. τούτους δὲ τοὺς θεοὺς ὑφίστανται τὸν σύμπαντα κόσμον διοικεῖν.

Isis" too, being interpreted, means "ancient," the name having been given to the Moon from her ancient and eternal origin. And they put horns upon her, both from the aspect with which she appears whenever she is crescent-shaped, and also from the cow which is consecrated to her among the Egyptians. And these deities they suppose to regulate the whole world.' 15
#### 5
Τοιαῦτα μὲν οὖν καὶ ταῦτα. ἔχεις δὲ καὶ ἐν
τῇ Φοινικικῇ θεολογίᾳ ὡς ἄρα Φοινίκων οἶ πρῶτοι φυσικοὶ ἥλιον καὶ σελήνην καὶ τοὺς λοιποὺς πλανήτας ἀστέρας καὶ τὰ στοιχεῖα καὶ τὰ τούτοις συναφῆ θεοὺς μόνους ἐγίνωσκον, καὶ ὅτι τούτοις οἶ παλαίτατοι τὰ τῆς γῆς ἀφιέρωσαν βλαστήματα, καὶ θεοὺς ἐνόμισαν,
καὶ προσεκύνουν ταῦτα, ἀφ’ ὧν αὐτοί τε διεγίνοντο

b
καὶ οἶ ἑπόμενοι, καὶ οἱ πρὸ αὐτῶν πάντες, καὶ χοὰς καὶ ἐπιχύσεις ἐτέλουν· ἔλεον δὲ καὶ οἶκτον καὶ κλαυθμὸν βλαστήματι γῆς ἀπιόντι καθιέρουν, καὶ γενέσει ζῴων ἐκ γῆς πρώτῃ καὶ τῇ ἐξ ἀλλήλων καὶ
τελευτῇ, καθ’ ἣν τοῦ ζῆν ἀπήρχοντο.

Such then are the statements on this subject. You find, too, in the Phoenician theology, that their first 'physical philosophers knew no other gods than the sun, the moon, and besides these the planets, the elements also, and the things connected with them'; and that to these the earliest of mankind 'consecrated the productions of the earth, and regarded them as gods, and worshipped them as the sources of sustenance to themselves and to following generations, and to all that went before them, and offered to them drink-offerings and libations.' But pity and lamentation and weeping they consecrated to the produce of the earth when perishing, and to the generation of living creatures at first from the earth, and then to their production one from another, and to their end, when they departed from life. These their notions of worship were in accordance with their own weakness, and the want as yet of any enterprise of mind.'
#### 6
αὗται δ’ ἦσαν αἶ ἐπίνοιαι τῆς προσκυνήσεως ὅμοιαι τῇ αὐτῶν ἀσθενείᾳ καὶ ψυχῆς ἔτι ἀτολμίᾳ. ταῦτα καὶ ἡ Φοινί-

λαμπρυνόμενος δυσφημίαις, ἐν οἶς ἐπέγραψε ‘‘Περὶ τῆς τῶν ἐμψύχων ἀποχῆς,” καὶ τῶν παλαιῶν ἀρχαιότητος τὴν μνήμην ὧδέ πως αὐτολεξεὶ, Θεοφράστῳ μάρτυρι
χρώμενος, παρατίθεται

Such are the statements of the Phoenician writings, as will be proved in due course. Moreover, one of our own time, that very man who gains celebrity by his abuse of us, in the treatise which he entitled Of Abstinence from Animal Food, makes mention of the old customs of the ancients as follows in his own words, on the testimony of Theophrastus:16
#### 7
“Ἀνάριθμος μέν τις ἔοικεν εἶναι χρόνος, ἀφ’ οὗ τό γε πάντων λογιώτατον γένος, ὥς φησι Θεόφραστος, καὶ τὴν ἱερωτάτην ὑπὸ τοῦ Νείλου κτισθεῖσαν χώραν κατοικοῦν, ἤρξαντο οἱ πρῶτοι ἐφ’ ἑστίας τοῖς
οὐρανίοις θεοῖς θύειν, οὐ σμύρνης οὐδὲ κασίας καὶ λιβανωτοῦ κρόκῳ μιχθέντων ἀπαρχάς· πολλαῖς γὰρ

d
γενεαῖς ὕστερα παρελήφθη ταῦτα, καὶ πλάνης μαστὴρ ὁ ἄνθρωπος γιγνόμενος τῆς ἀναγκαίας ζωῆς μετὰ πολλῶν πόνων καὶ δακρύων σταγόνας τούτων
ἀπήρξατο τοῖς θεοῖς·)

[PORPHYRY] 'It is probably an incalculable time since, as Theophrastus says, the most learned race of mankind, inhabiting that most sacred land which Nilus founded, were the first to begin to offer upon the hearth to the heavenly deities not the first-fruits of myrrh nor of cassia and frankincense mingled with saffron; for these were adopted many generations later, when man becoming a wanderer in search of his necessary livelihood with many toils and tears offered drops of these tinctures as first-fruits to the gods.
#### 8
οὐ τούτων οὖν ἔθυον πρόερον, ἀλλὰ χλόης οἱονεί τινα τῆς γονίμου φύσεως χνοῦν ταῖς χερσὶν ἀράμενοι. δένδρα μὲν γὰρ δὴ πρὸ ζῴων ἀνέδωκεν ἡ γῆ, τῶν δένδρων δὲ πολὺ πρόσθεν τὴν ἐπέτειον γεννωμένην πόαν· ἧς δρεπόμενοι φύλλα
καὶ ῥίζας καὶ τοὺς ὅλους τῆς φύσεως αὐτῶν βλαστοῦς κατέκαιον, ταύτῃ τοὺς φαινομένους οὐρανίους θεοὺς τῇ θυσίᾳ δεξιούμενοι, καὶ τοῦ πυρὸς ἀπαθανατίςοντες αὐτοῖς τὰς τιμάς.

'"Of these then they made no offerings formerly, but of herbage, which they lifted up in their hands as the bloom of the productive power of nature. For the earth gave forth trees before animals, and long before trees the herbage which is produced year by year; and of this they culled leaves and roots and the whole shoots of their growth, and burned them, greeting thus the visible deities of heaven with their offering, and dedicating to them the honours of perpetual fire.
#### 9
τούτοις γὰρ καὶ τὸ πῦρ ἀθάνατον ἐφύλαττον ἐν τοῖς ἱεροῖς, ὡς ὂν μάλιστα

29
αὐτοῖς ὁμοιότατον. ἐκ δὲ τῆς θυμιάσεως τῶν ἀπὸ γῆς θυμιατήριά τε ἐκάλουν καὶ τὸ θύειν καὶ θυσίας, ἃ δὴ ἡμεῖς ὡς τὴν ὑστέραν πλημμέλειαν σημαίνοντα οὐκ ὀρθῶς ἐξακούομεν, τὴν διὰ τῶν ζῴων δοκοῦσαν θεραπείαν καλοῦντες θυσίαν.
10
τοσοῦτον 30] [*]

v.1.p.35
δὲ τοῖς παλαιοῖς τοῦ μὴ παραβαίνειν τὸ ἔθος ἔμελεν ὡς κατὰ τῶν ἐκλειπόντων τὸ ἀρχαῖον, ἐπεισαγόντων δὲ ἕτερον, ἀρασαμένους ἀρώματα τὰ θυμιώμενα προσαγορεύσαι.

'For these they also kept in their temples an undying fire, as being most especially like them. And from the fume (θυμιασις) of the produce of the earth they formed the words θυμιατηρια (altars of incense), and θυειν (to offer), and θυσιας (offerings),—words which we misunderstand as signifying the erroneous practice of later times, when we apply the term θυσια to the so-called worship which consists of animal sacrifice.

'And so anxious were the men of old not to transgress their custom, that they cursed (αρωμαι) those who neglected the old fashion and introduced another, calling their own incense-offerings αρωματα.' 
#### 11
Ταῦτα εἰπὼν ἐπιλέγει μεθ’ ἕτερα

b
“Πόρρω δὲ τῶν περὶ τὰς θυσίας ἀπαρχῶν τοῖς ἀνθρώποις προιουσῶν παρανομίας ἡ τῶν δεινοτάτων θυμάτων παράληψις ἐπεισήχθη ὠμότητος πλήρης, ὡς δοκεῖν τὰς πρόσθεν λεχθείσας καθ’ ἡμῶν ἀρὰς νῦν
τέλος εἰληφέναι, σφαξάντων τῶν ἀνθρώπων καὶ τοὺς βωμοὺς αἱμαξάντων.”

After these and other statements he adds:

'But when these beginnings of sacrifices were carried by men to a great pitch of disorder, the adoption of the most dreadful offerings, full of cruelty, was introduced; so that the curses formerly pronounced against us seemed now to have received fulfilment, when men slaughtered victims and defiled the altars with blood.' 17
#### 12
Τοσαῦτα καὶ ὁ Πορφύριος οὐ μᾶλλον ἢ ὁ Θεόφραστος. ἐπισφράγισμα δὲ τοῦ λόγου γένοιτ’ ἂν ἡμῖν ὁ Πλάτων’ ἐν Κρατύλῳ, πρόσθεν τῶν εἰφημένων

c

αὐτῷ περὶ τῶν Ἑλλήνων ὧδέ πη φάσκων πρὸς ῥῆμα
Φαίνονταί μοι οἱ πρῶτοι τῶν ἀνθρώπων τῶν περὶ τὴν Ἑλλάδα τούτους μόνους θεοὺς ἡγεῖσθαι, οὕσπερ νῦν πολλοὶ τῶν βαρβάρων, ἥλιον καὶ σελήνην
καὶ γῆν καὶ ἄστρα καὶ οὐρανόν· ἅτε οὖν αὐτὰ ὁρῶντες πάντα ἀεὶ ἰόντα δρόμῳ καὶ θέοντα, ἀπὸ ταύτης τῆς φύσεως τῆς τοῦ θεῖν θεοὺς αὐτοὺς ἐπονομάσαι.”

So far writes Porphyry, or rather Theophrastus: and we may find a seal and confirmation of the statement in what Plato in the Cratylus, before his remarks concerning the Greeks, says word for word as follows:

[PLATO] 'It appears to me that the first inhabitants of Hellas had only the same gods as many of the barbarians have now, namely the sun, moon, earth, stars, and heaven: as therefore they saw them always moving on in their course and running (θεοντα), from this their natural tendency to run they called them θεουσ (gods).' 18
#### 13
Ἀλλ’ ὅτι μὲν οἱ πρῶτοι καὶ παλαίτατοι τῶν

d

ἀνθρώπων οὔτε ναῶν οἰκοδομίαις προσεῖχον οὔτε ξοάνων ἀφιδρύμασιν, οὔπω τότε γραφικῆς οὐδὲ πλαστικῆς ἢ γλυπτικῆς ἢ ἀνδριαντοποιητικῆς τέχνης ἐφευρημένης, οὐδὲ μὴν οἰκοδομικῆς οὐδὲ ἀρχιτεκτονικῆς πω συνεστώσης, παντί τῳ οἶμαι συλλογιζομένῳ
δῆλον εἶναι.

But I think it must be evident to every one on consideration that the first and most ancient of mankind did not apply themselves either to building temples or to setting up statues, since at that time no art of painting, or modelling, [or carving], or statuary had yet been discovered, nor, indeed, were building or architecture as yet established.
#### 14
ὅτι δὲ οὐδὲ τῶν μετὰ ταῦτα [*]

v.1.p.36
κατωνομασμένων θεῶν τε καὶ ἡρώων μνήμη τις τοῖς τότε παρῆν, οὔτ’ οὖν τις ἦν αὐτοῖς Ζεὺς, οὐ Κρόνος, οὐ Ποσειδῶν, οὐκ Ἀπόλλων, οὐχ Ἥρα, οὐκ Ἀθηνᾶ, οὐ Διόνυσος, οὐδέ τις ἕτερος θήλειά τε καὶ ἄρρην θεὸς, οἷοι μετὰ ταῦτα μυρίοι παρά τε βαρβάροις καὶ
Ἕλλησιν, ἀλλ’ οὐδὲ δαίμων τις ἀγαθὸς ἢ φαῦλος ἐν ἀνθρώποις ἐθαυμάζετο, μόνα δὲ τὰ φαινόμενα τῶν
30
οὐρανίων ἄστρων, παρὰ τὸ θέειν, ὅπερ ἐστὶ τρέχειν, θεῶν τε προσηγορίας, ὡς αὐτοί φασιν, ἐτύγχανε, καὶ οὐδὲ ταῦτα ταῖς διὰ ζῴων θυςίαις καὶ ταῖς μετὰ
20
ταῦτα περινοηθείσαις τιμαῖς ἐθρησκεύετο, οὐχ ἡμέτερος ὁ λόγος, οἴκοθεν δὲ καὶ ἐξ αὐτῶν Ἑλλήνων ἡ μαρτυρία, διὰ τῶν προτεθειμενων φωνῶν καὶ τῶν αὖθις ἑξῆς παρατεθησομένων τὴν ἀπόδειξιν παρασχομένη.

Nor was there any mention among the men of that age of those who have since been denominated gods and heroes, nor had they any Zeus, nor Kronos, Poseidon, Apollo, Hera, Athena, Dionysus, nor any other deity, either male or female, such as there were afterwards in multitudes among both barbarians and Greeks; nor was there any daemon good or bad reverenced among men, but only the visible stars of heaven because of their running (θεειν) received, as they themselves say, the title of gods (θεων), and even these were not worshipped with animal sacrifices and the honours afterwards superstitiously invented.

This statement is not ours, but the testimony comes from within, and from the Greeks themselves, and supplies its proof by the words which have been already quoted and by those which will hereafter be set forth in due order.
#### 15
τοῦτο δὲ καὶ οἱ ἱεροὶ καθ’ ἡμᾶς διδάσκουσι
λόγοι, πᾶσι μὲν τοῖς ἔθνεσι τὸ κατ’ ἀρχὰς τὴν τῶν ὁρωμενων φωστήρων τιμὴν ἀπονενεμῆσθαι περιέχοντες, μόνῳ δὲ τῷ Ἑβραςιων γένει τὴν ἐποπτείαν

b
ἀνατεθεῖσθαι [τῆς θεωρίας] τοῦ τῶν ὅλων ποιητοῦ τε καὶ δημιουργοῦ θεοῦ καὶ τῆς εἰς αὐτὸν
ἀληθοῦς εὐσεβείας.

This is what our holy Scriptures also teach, in which it is contained, that in the beginning the worship of the visible luminaries had been assigned to all the nations, and that to the Hebrew race alone had been entrusted the full initiation into the knowledge of God the Maker and Artificer of the universe, and of true piety towards Him. 
#### 16
οὐκ ἄρα τις ἦν θεογονίας Ἑλληνικῆς ἢ βαρβαρικῆς τοῖς παλαιτάτοις τῶν ἀνθρώπων λόγος, οὐδὲ ξοάνων ἀψύχων ἵδρυσις οὐδ’ ἡ νῦν πολλὴ φλυαρία τῆς τῶν θεῶν ἀρρένων τε καὶ θηλειῶν κατονομασίας.

So then among the oldest of mankind there was no mention of a Theogony, either Greek or barbarian, nor any erection of lifeless statues, nor all the silly talk that there is now about the naming of the gods both male and female.
#### 17
εἱ γοῦν προσηγορίαι
καὶ τὰ ὀνόματα ἐξ ἀνθρώπων ὕστερον ἐφευρημένα οὔπω τότε ἐν ἀνθρώποις ἐγνωρίζετο, ἀλλ’ οὐδὲ δαιμόνων καὶ πνευμάτων ἀφανῶν ἀνακλήσεις, οὐκ ἔκτοποι

c
περὶ θεῶν καὶ ἡρώων μυθολογίαι, οὐκ ἀπορρήτων τελετῶν μυστήρια, οὐδ’ ὅλως τι τῆς πολλῆς
καὶ ἀδολέσχου τῶν μετέπειτα ἀνδρῶν δεισιδαιμονίας.

In fact the titles and names which men have since invented were not as yet known among mankind: no, nor yet invocations of invisible daemons and spirits, nor absurd mythologies about gods and heroes, nor mysteries of secret initiations, nor anything at all of the excessive and frivolous superstition of later generations.
#### 18
ἀνθρώπων ἄρα ταῦτα ἦν εὑρήματα καὶ θνητῆς

v.1.p.37
φύσεως ἀναπλάσματα, μᾶλλον δὲ τρόπων αἰσχρῶν καὶ ἀκολάστων ἐπιτεχνήματα, κατὰ τὸ παρ’ ἡμῖν θεῖον λόγιον τὸ φάσκον “ἀρχὴ πορνείας ἐπίνοια εἰδώλω.”

These then were men's inventions, and representations of our mortal nature, or rather new devices of base and licentious dispositions, according to our divine oracle which says, The devising of idols was the beginning of fornication.19 
#### 19
ἡ γοῦν τῶν ἐθνῶν ἁπάντων πολύθεος
πλάνη μακροῖς ὕστερον αἰῶσι πέφανται, ἀρξαμένη μὲν ἀπὸ Φοινίκων καὶ· Αἰγυπτίων , διαβᾶσα δὲ ἐκ

d
τούτων ἐπί τε τὰ λοιπὰ ἔθνη καὶ μέχρις αὐτῶν Ἑλλήνων, ὡς καὶ τοῦτο πάλιν ἡ τῶν παλαιτάτων ἱστορία κατέχει, ἣν καὶ αὐτὴν ἐπισκέψασθαι καιρὸς ἀπὸ
τῶν Φοινικικῶν ἀρξαμένους.

In fact the polytheistic error of all the nations is only seen long ages afterwards, having taken its beginning from the Phoenicians and Egyptians, and passed over from them to the other nations, and even to the Greeks themselves. For this again is affirmed by the history of the earliest ages; which history itself it is now time for us to review, beginning from the Phoenician records.
#### p20
Ἱστορεῖ δὲ ταῦτα Σαγχουνιάθων, ἀνὴρ παλαίτατος καὶ τῶν Τρωικῶν χρόνων, ὥς φασι, πρεσβύτερος, ὃν καὶ ἐπ’ ἀκριβείᾳ καὶ ἀληθείᾳ τῆς Φοινικικῆς ἱστορίας ἀποδεχθῆναι μαρτυροῦσι. Φίλων
δὲ τούτου πᾶσαν τὴν συγγραφὴν ὁ Βύβλιος, οὐχ ὁ Ἑβραῖος, μεταβαλὼν ἀπὸ τῆς Φοινίκων γλώττης ἐπὶ τὴν Ἑλλάδα φωνὴν ἐξέδωκε. μέμνηται τούτων ὁ καθ’

31
ἡμᾶς τὴν καθ’ ἡμῶν πεποιημένος συσκευὴν ἐν τετάρτῳ τῆς πρὸς ἡμᾶς ὑποθέσεως, ὧδε τῷ ἀνδρὶ μαρτυρῶν
πρὸς λέξιν

Now the historian of this subject is Sanchuniathon, an author of great antiquity, and older, as they say, than the Trojan times, one whom they testify to have been approved for the accuracy and truth of his Phoenician History. Philo of Byblos, not the Hebrew, translated his whole work from the Phoenician language into the Greek, and published it. The author in our own day of the compilation against us mentions these things in the fourth book of his treatise Against the Christians, where he bears the following testimony to Sanchuniathon, word for word:
#### p21
“ἱστορεῖ δὲ τὰ περὶ Ἰουδαίων ἀληθέστατα, ὅτι καὶ τοῖς τόποις καὶ τοῖς ὀνόμασιν αὐτῶν τὰ συμφωνότατα, Σαγχουνιάθων ὁ Βηρύτιος, εἰληφὼς τὰ ὑπομνήματα παρὰ Ἱερομβάλου τοῦ ἱερέως θεοῦ τοῦ

b
καὶ πρὸ τῶν Τρωïκῶν πίπτουσι χρόνων, καὶ σχεδὸν τοῖς Μώσεως πλησιάζουσιν, ὡς αἶ τῶν Φοινίκης βασιλέων
σιλέων μηνύουσι διαδοχαί. Σαγχουνιάθων δὲ κατὰ τὴν Φοινίκων διάλεκτον φιλαληθῶς πᾶσαν τὴν παλαιὰν ἱστορίαν ἐκ τῶν κατὰ πόλιν ὑπομνημάτων καὶ
v.1.p.38
τῶν ἐν τοῖς ἱεροῖς ἀναγραφῶν συναγαγὼν δὴ καὶ συγγράψας ἐπὶ Σεμιράμεως γέγονε τῆς Ἀσσυρίων βασιλίδος, ἣ πρὸ τῶν Ἰλιακῶν, ἢ κατ’ αὐτούς γε τοὺς χρόνους γενέσθαι ἀναγέγραπται. τὰ δὲ τοῦ Σαγχουνιάθωνος
c
εἰς Ἑλλάδα γλῶσσαν ἡρμήνευσε Φίλων ὁ
Βύβλιος.”

[PORPHYRY] 'Of the affairs of the Jews the truest history, because the most in accordance with their places and names, is that of Sanchuniathon of Berytus, who received the records from Hierombalus the priest of the god Ieuo; he dedicated his history to Abibalus king of Berytus, and was approved by him and by the investigators of truth in his time. Now the times of these men fall even before the date of the Trojan war, and approach nearly to the times of Moses, as is shown by the successions of the kings of Phoenicia. And Sanchuniathon, who made a complete collection of ancient history from the records in the various cities and from the registers in the temples, and wrote in the Phoenician language with a love of truth, lived in the reign of Semiramis, the queen of the Assyrians, who is recorded to have lived before the Trojan war or in those very times. And the works of Sanchuniathon were translated into the Greek tongue by Philo of Byblos.' 20
#### p22
Ταῦτα μὲν ὁ δηλωθεὶς, ἀλήθειαν ὁμοῦ καὶ παλαιότητα τῷ δὴ θεολόγῳ μαρτυρήσας. ὁ δὲ προιὼν, οὐ τὸν ἐπὶ πάντων θεὸν, οὐδὲ μὴν θεοὺς τοὺς κατ’ οὐρανὸν, θνητοὺς δὲ ἄνδρας καὶ γυναῖκας, οὐδὲ τὸν
τρόπον ἀστείους, οἴους δι’ ἀρετὴν ἄξιον εἶναι ἀποδέξασθαι ἢ ζηλῶσαι τῆς φιλοσοφίας, φαυλότητος δὲ καὶ μοχθηρίας ἁπάσης κακίαν περιβεβλημένους Θεολογεῖ. 

So wrote the author before mentioned, bearing witness at once to the truthfulness and antiquity of the so-called theologian. But he, as he goes forward, treats as divine not the God who is over all, nor yet the gods in the heaven, but mortal men and women, not even refined in character, such as it would be right to approve for their virtue, or emulate for their love of wisdom, but involved in the dishonour of every kind of vileness and wickedness.

καὶ μαρτυρεῖ γε τούτους αὐτοὺς ἐκείνους εἶναι,

d
τοὺς εἰσέτι καὶ νῦν θεοὺς παρὰ τοῖς πᾶσι νενομισμένους
21
κατά τε τὰς πόλεις καὶ τὰς χώρας. 

He testifies also that these are the very same who are still regarded as gods by all both in the cities and in country districts. 

δέχου δὲ καὶ τούτων ἐκ τῶν ἐγγράφων τὰς ἀποδείξεις.

But let me give you the proofs of this out of his writings.
#### p23
ὁ δὴ Φίλων εἰς ἐννέα βίβλους τὴν πᾶσαν τοῦ Σαγχουνιάθωνος πραγματείαν διελὼν, κατὰ τὸ προοίμιον τοῦ πρώτου συγγράμματος αὐτοῖς ῥήμασι προλέγει
περὶ τοῦ Σαγχουνιάθωνος ταῦτα

Philo then, having divided the whole work of Sanchuniathon into nine books, in the introduction to the first book makes this preface concerning Sanchuniathon, word for word: 21
#### p24
“Τούτων οὕτως ἐχόντων ὁ Σαγχουνιάθων, ἀνὴρ πολυμαθὴς καὶ πολυπράγμων γενόμενος, καὶ τὰ ἐξ ἀρχῆς, ἀφ’ οὗ τὰ πάντα συνέστη, παρὰ πάντων εἰδέναι ποθῶν, πολυφροντίστως ἐξεμάστευσε τὰ
Τααύτου, εἰδὼς ὅτι τῶν ὑφ’ ἡλίῳ γεγονότων πρῶτός ἐστι Τάαυτος, ὁ τῶν γραμμάτων τὴν εὕρεσιν ἐπινοήσας καὶ τῆς τῶν ὑπομνημάτων γραφῆς κατάρξας, καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦδε ὥσπερ κρηπῖδα βαλόμενος τοῦ λόγου, ὃν

32
Αἰγύπτιοι μὲν ἐκάλεσαν Θωὺθ, Ἀλεξανδρεῖς δὲ Θὼθ,
Ἑρμῆν δὲ Ἓλληνες μετέφρασαν.”

[PHILO] 'These things being so, Sanchuniathon, who was a man of much learning and great curiosity, and desirous of knowing the earliest history of all nations from the creation of the world, searched out with great care the history of Taautus, knowing that of all men under the sun Taautus was the first who thought of the invention of letters, and began the writing of records: and he laid the foundation, as it were, of his history, by beginning with him, whom the Egyptians called Thoyth, and the Alexandrians Thoth, translated by the Greeks into Hermes.'
#### p25
Ταῦτα εἰπὼν ἐπιμέμφεται τοῖς νεωτέροις

v.1.p.39
τοῖς μετὰ ταῦτα, ὡς ἂν βεβιασμένως καὶ οὐκ ἀληθῶς τοὺς περὶ θεῶν μύθους ἐπ’ ἀλληγορίας καὶ φυσικὰς διηγήσεις τε καὶ θεωρίας ἀνάγουσι· λέγει δ’ οὖν προίων

After these statements he finds fault with the more recent authors as violently and untruly reducing the legends concerning the gods to allegories and physical explanations and theories; and so he goes on to say:
#### p26
“Ἀλλ’ οἱ μὲν νεώτατοι τῶν ἱερολόγων τὰ μὲν γεγονότα πράγματα ἐξ ἀρχῆς ἀπεπέμψαντο, ἀλληγορίας δὲ καὶ μύθους ἐπινοήσαντες καὶ τοῖς κοσμι- κοῖς παθήμασι συγγένειαν πλασάμενοι μυστήρια κατέστησαν,

b
πολὺν αὐτοῖς ἐπῆγον τῦφον, ὡς μὴ
ῥᾳδίως τινὰ συνορᾶν τὰ κατ’ ἀλήθειαν γενόμενα· ὁ δὲ συμβαλὼν τοῖς ἀπὸ τῶν ἀδύτων εὑρεθεῖσιν ἀπο- κρύφοις Ἀμμουνέων γράμμασι συγκειμένοις, ἃ δὴ οὐκ ἦν πᾶσι γνώριμα, τὴν μάθησιν ἁπάντων αὐτὸς ἤσκησε· καὶ τέλος ἐπιθεὶς τῇ πραγματείᾳ, τὸν κατ’
ἀρχὰς μῦθον καὶ τὰς ἀλληγορίας ἐκποδὼν ποιησάμενος, ἐξηνύσατο τὴν πρόθεσιν, ἴως πάλιν οἱ ἐπιγενόμενοι ἱερεῖς χρόνοις ὕστερον ἠθέλησαν αὐτὴν ἀποκρύψαι, καὶ εἰς τὸ μυθῶδες ἀποκαταστῆσαι· ἐξ οὗ τὸ μυστικὸν ἀνέκυπτεν οὐδέπω φθάσαν εἰς
Ἓλληνας.”
c

'But the most recent of the writers on religion rejected the real events from the beginning, and having invented allegories and myths, and formed a fictitious affinity to the cosmical phenomena, established mysteries, and overlaid them with a cloud of absurdity, so that one cannot easily discern what really occurred: but he having lighted upon the collections of secret writings of the Ammoneans which were discovered in the shrines and of course were not known to all men, applied himself diligently to the study of them all; and when he had completed the investigation, he put aside the original myth and the allegories, and so completed his proposed work; until the priests who followed in later times wished to hide this away again, and to restore the mythical character; from which time mysticism began to rise up, not having previously reached the Greeks.'
#### p27
Τούτοις ἑξῆς φησιν

Next to this he says:

“Ταῦθ’ ἡμῖν εὕρηται ἐπιμελῶς εἰδέναι τὰ Φοινίκων ποθοῦσι, καὶ πολλὴν ἐξερευνησαμένοις ὕλην, οὐχὶ τὴν παρ’ Ἕλλησι· διάφωνος γὰρ αὕτη καὶ φιλονεικότεον
ὑπ’ ἐνίων μᾶλλον ἢ πρὸς ἀλήθειαν συντεθεῖσα.

'These things I have discovered in my anxious desire to know the history of the Phoenicians, and after a thorough investigation of much matter, not that which is found among the Greeks, for that is contradictory, and compiled by some in a contentious spirit rather than with a view to truth.'
#### p28
Καὶ μεθ’ ἕτερα

And after other statements:

Οὕτως τε ἔχειν πεπεῖσθαι ἡμῖν παρέστη ὡς ἐκεῖνος γέγραφε, τὴν διαφωνίαν ὁρῶσι τὴν παρ’ Ἓλλησι.
περὶ ἧς μοι τρία πεφιλοτίμηται βιβλία τὴν d ἐπιγραφὴν ἔχοντα Παραδόξου ἱστορίας.”

'And the conviction that the facts were as he has described them came to me, on seeing the disagreement among the Greeks: concerning which I have carefully composed three books bearing the title Paradoxical History.'
#### p29
Καὶ αὖθις μεθ’ ἕτερα ἐπιλέγει

And again after other statements he adds:

v.1.p.40
“Προδιαρθρῶσαι δὲ ἀναγκαῖον πρὸς τὴν αὖθις σαφήνειαν, καὶ τὴν τῶν κατὰ μέρος διάγνωσιν ὅτι οἱ παλαίτατοι τῶν βαρβάρων, ἐξαιρέτως δὲ Φοίνικές τε καὶ Αἰγύπτιοι, παρ’ ὧν καὶ οἱ λοιποὶ παρέλαβον ἄνθρωποι, θεοὺς ἐνόμιζον μεγίστους τοὺς τὰ πρὸς
τὴν βιωτικὴν χρείαν εὑρόντας, ἢ καὶ κατά τι εὖ ποιήσαντας τὰ ἔθνη· εὐεργέτας τε τούτους καὶ πολλῶν αἰτίους ἀγαθῶν ἡγούμενοι ὡς θεοὺς προσεκύνουν, καὶ εἰς τὸ χρεὼν μεταστάντας ναοὺς κατασκευασάμενοι,

33
στήλας τε καὶ ῥάβδους ἀφιέρουν ἐξ
ὀνόματος αὐτῶν, καὶ ταῦτα μεγάλως σεβόμενοι, καὶ ἑορτὰς ἔνεμον αὐτοῖς τὰς μεγίστας Φοίνικες· ἐξαιρέτως δὲ καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν σφετέρων βασιλέων τοῖς κοσμικοῖς στοιχείοις καί τισι τῶν νομιζομένων θεῶν τὰς ὀνομασίας ἐπέθεσαν· φυσικοὺς δὲ ἥλιον καὶ σελήνην
καὶ τοὺς λοιποὺς πλανήτας ἀστέρας καὶ τὰ στοιχεῖα καὶ τὰ τούτοις συναφῆ θεοὺς μόνους ἐγίνωσκον, ὥστ’ αὐτοῖς τοὺς μὲν θνητοὺς, τοὺς δὲ ἀθανάτους θεοὺς εἷναι.”

'But with a view to clearness hereafter, and the determination of particulars, it is necessary to state distinctly beforehand that the most ancient of the barbarians, and especially the Phoenicians and Egyptians, from whom the rest of mankind received their traditions, regarded as the greatest gods those who had discovered the necessaries of life, or in some way done good to the nations. Esteeming these as benefactors and authors of many blessings, they worshipped them also as gods after their death, and built shrines, and consecrated pillars and staves after their names: these the Phoenicians held in great reverence, and assigned to them their greatest festivals. Especially they applied the names of their kings to the elements of the cosmos, and to some of those who were regarded as gods. But they knew no other gods than those of nature, sun, and moon, and the rest of the wandering stars, and the elements and things connected with them, so that some of their gods were mortal and some immortal.'
#### p30
Ταῦτα κατὰ τό προοίμιον ὁ Φίλων διαστειλάμενος

22

Philo having explained these points in his preface, next begins his interpretation of Sanchuniathon by setting forth the theology of the Phoenicians as follows:
### c10
#### p1
“ Τὴν τῶν ὅλων ἀρχὴν ὑποτίθεται ἀέρα ζο c φώδη καὶ πνευματώδη, ἢ πνοὴν ἀέρος ζοφώδους,
καὶ χάος θολερὸν, ἐρεβῶδες. ταῦτα δὲ εἶναι ἄπειρα καὶ διὰ πολὺν αἰῶνα μὴ ἔχειν πέρας. ὅτε δὲ, φησὶν, ἠράσθη τὸ πνεῦμα τῶν ἰδίων ἀρχῶν καὶ ἐγένετο σύγκρασις, ἡ πλοκὴ ἐκείνη ἐκλήθη πόθος. αὕτη δὲ ἀρχὴ κτίσεως ἁπάντων. αὐτὸ δὲ οὐκ ἐγίνωσκε τὴν
αὐτοῦ κτίσιν, καὶ ἐκ τῆς αὐτοῦ συμπλοκῆς τοῦ πνεύματος ἐγένετο Μώτ.

'The first principle of the universe he supposes to have been air dark with cloud and wind, or rather a blast of cloudy air, and a turbid chaos dark as Erebus; and these were boundless and for long ages had no limit. But when the wind, says he, became enamoured of its own parents, and a mixture took place, that connexion was called Desire. This was the beginning of the creation of all things: but the wind itself had no knowledge of its own creation. From its connexion Mot was produced, 
#### p2

which some say is mud, and others a putrescence of watery compound; and out of this came every germ of creation, and the generation of the universe. So there were certain animals which had no sensation, and out of them grew intelligent animals, and were called "Zophasemin," that is "observers of heaven"; and they were formed like the shape of an egg. Also Mot burst forth into light, and sun, and moon, and stars, and the great constellations.'
#### p3
Τοιαύτη μὲν αὐτῶν ἡ κοσμογονία, ἄντικρυς ἀθεότητα εἰσάγουσα· ἴδωμεν δὲ ἐξῆς ὡς καὶ τὴν
ζωογονίαν ὑποστῆναι λέγει. φησὶν οὑν

Such was their cosmogony, introducing downright atheism. But let us see next how he states the generation of animals to have arisen. He says, then:
#### p4
“Καὶ τοῦ ἀέρος διαυγάσαντος, διὰ πύρωσιν καὶ τῆς θαλάσσης καὶ τῆς γῆς ἐγένετο πνεύματα καὶ νέφη καὶ οὐρανίων ὑδάτων μέγισται καταφοραὶ καὶ χύσεις. καὶ ἐπειδὴ διεκρίθη, καὶ τοῦ ἰδίου τόπου
διεχωρίσθη διὰ τὴν τοῦ ἡλίου πύρωσιν, καὶ πάντα συνήντησε πάλιν ἐν ἀέρι τάδε τοῖσδε, καὶ συνέρραξαν, βρονταί τε ἀπετελέσθησαν καὶ ἀστραπαὶ, καὶ πρὸς τὸν πάταγον τῶν βροντῶν τὰ πριγεγραννέβα

34
νοερὰ ζῷα ἐγρηγόρησεν, καὶ πρὸς τὸν ἦχον ἐπτύρη,
καὶ ἐκινήθη ἔν τε γῇ καὶ θαλάσσῃ ἄρρεν καὶ θῆλυ.”

'And when the air burst into light, both the sea and the land became heated, and thence arose winds and clouds, and very great downpours and floods of the waters of heaven. So after they were separated, and removed from their proper place because of the sun's heat, and all met together again in the air dashing together one against another, thunderings and lightnings were produced, and at the rattle of the thunder the intelligent animals already described woke up, and were scared at the sound, and began to move both on land and sea, male and female.'
#### p5
Τοιαύτη αὐτοῖς καὶ ἡ ζωογονία. τούτοις ἐξῆς ὁ αὐτὸς συγγραφεὺς ἐπιφέρει λέγων

Such is their theory of the generation of animals. Next after this the same writer adds and says:

“Ταῦθ’ ηὑρέθη ἐν τῇ κοσμογονίᾳ γεγραμμένα
Τααύτου καὶ τοῖς ἐκείνου ὑπομνήμασιν, ἔκ τε στοχασμῶν καὶ τεκμηρίων ὧν ἑώρακεν αὐτοῦ ἡ διάνοια καὶ ηὗρε καὶ ἡμῖν ἐφώτισεν.’

'These things were found written in the cosmogony of Taautus, and in his Commentaries, both from conjectures, and from evidences which his intellect discerned, and discovered, and made clear to us.'
#### p6
Ἑξῆς τούτοις ὀνόματα τῶν ἀνέμων εἰπὼν νότοου

b
καὶ βορέου καὶ τῶν λοιπῶν ἐπιλέγει

Next to this, after mentioning the names of the winds Notos and Boreas and the rest, he continues:

“Ἀλλ’ οὗτοί γε πρῶτοι ἀφιέρωσαν τὰ τῆς γῆς βλαστήματα καὶ θεοὺς ἐνόμισαν, καὶ προσεκύνουν ταῦτα, ἀφ’ ὦν αὐτοί τε διεγένοντο καὶ οἶ ἑπόμενοι,

v.1.p.42
καὶ οἱ πρὸ αὐτῶν πάντες, καὶ χοὰς καὶ ἐπιθύσεις ἐποίουν.”

'But these were the first who consecrated the productions of the earth, and regarded them as gods, and worshipped them as being the support of life both to themselves, and to those who were to come after them, and to all before them, and they offered to them drink-offerings and libations.'
#### p7
Καὶ ἐπιλέγει

He adds also:

“Αὗται δ ἦσαν αἱ ἐπίνοιαι τῆς προσκυνήσεως ὅμοιαι τῇ αὐτῶν ἀσθενείᾳ καὶ ψυχῆς ἀτολμίᾳ. εἶτά
φησι γεγενῆσθαι ἐκ τοῦ Κολπία ἀνέμου καὶ γυναικὸς Βάαυτ, τοῦτο δὲ νύκτα ἑρμηνεύει, Αἰῶνα καὶ Πρωτόγονον, θνητοὺς ἄνδρας, οὕτω καλουμένους·

c
εὑρεῖν δὲ τὸν Αἰῶνα τὴν ἀπὸ δένδρων τροφήν. ἐκ τούτων τοὺς γενομένους κληθῆναι Γένος καὶ Γενεὰν,
καὶ οἰκῆσαι τὴν Φοινίκην· αὐχμῶν δὲ γενομένων τὰς χεῖρας εἰς οὐρανὸν ὀρέγειν πρὸς τὸν ἥλιον. τοῦτον γὰρ (φησὶ) θεὸν ἐνόμιζον μόνον οὐρανοῦ κύριον. Βεελσάμην καλοῦντες, ὅ ἐστι παρὰ Φοίνιξι κύριος οὐρανοῦ, Ζεὺς δὲ παρ Ἕλλησι.”

'These were their notions of worship, corresponding to their own weakness, and timidity of soul. Then he says that from the wind Colpias and his wife Baau (which he translates "Night") were born Aeon and Protogonus, mortal men, so called: and that Aeon discovered the food obtained from trees. That their offspring were called Genos and Genea, and inhabited Phoenicia: and that when droughts occurred, they stretched out their hands to heaven towards the sun; for him alone (he says) they regarded as god the lord of heaven, calling him Beelsamen, which is in the Phoenician language "lord of heaven," and in Greek "Zeus."'
#### p8
Μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα πλάνην Ἕλλησιν αἰτιᾶται λέγων

And after this he charges the Greeks with error, saying:

“Οὐ γὰρ ματαίως αὐτὰ πολλαχῶς διεστειλάμεθα, σιν ὀνομάτων, ἅπερ οἱ Ἕλληνες ἀγνοήσαντες ἄλλως ἐξεδέξαντο, πλανηθέντες τῇ ἀμφιβολίᾳ τῆς
μεταφράσεως.”

'For it is not without cause that we have explained these things in many ways, but in view of the later misinterpretations of the names in the history, which the Greeks in ignorance took in a wrong sense, being deceived by the ambiguity of the translation.'
#### p9
Ἑξῆς φησιν

Afterwards he says:

“Ἀπὸ Γένους Αἰῶνος καὶ Πρωτογόνου γεννηθῆναι αὖθις παῖδας θνητοὺς, οἷς εἶναι ὀνόματα Φῶς καὶ Πύρ καὶ Φλόξ. οὗτοι (φησὶν) ἐκ παρατριβῆς

v.1.p.43

'From Genos, son of Aeon and Protogonus, were begotten again mortal children, whose names are Light, and Fire, and Flame. These, says he, discovered fire from rubbing pieces of wood together, and taught the use of it. And they begat sons of surpassing size and stature, whose names were applied to the mountains which they occupied: so that from them were named mount Cassius, and Libanus, and Antilibanus, and Brathy. From these, he says, were begotten Memrumus and Hypsuranius; and they got their names, he says, from their mothers, as the women in those days had free intercourse with any whom they met.'
#### p10
Εἶτά φησι

Then he says:

35
“Τὸν Ὑψουράνιον οἰκῆσαι Τυρὸν, καλύβας τε
ἐπινοῆσαι ἀπὸ καλάμων καὶ θρύων καὶ παπύρου, στασιάσαι δὲ πρὸς τὸν ἀδελφὸν Οὔσωνον, ὃς τῷ σώματι ·πρῶτος ἐκ δερμάτων ὧν ἴσχυσε συλλαβεῖν θηρίων εὗρε. ῥαγδαίων δὲ γενομένων ὄμβρων καὶ πνευμάτων παρατριβέντα τὰ ἐν τῇ Τυρῷ δένδρα

b
δὲ δύο στήλας πυρὶ καὶ πνεύματι, καὶ προσκυνῆσαι, αἷμά τε σπένδειν αὐταῖς ἐξ ὧν ἤγρευε θηρίων.

'Hypsuranius inhabited Tyre, and contrived huts out of reeds and rushes and papyrus: and he quarrelled with his brother Ousous, who first invented a covering for the body from skins of wild beasts which he was strong enough to capture. And when furious rains and winds occurred, the trees in Tyre were rubbed against each other and caught fire, and burnt down the wood that was there. And Ousous took a tree, and, having stripped off the branches, was the first who ventured to embark on the sea; and be consecrated two pillars to fire and wind, and worshipped them, and poured libations of blood upon them from the wild beasts which he took in hunting.
#### p11

τούτων δὲ τελευτησάντων τοὺς ἀπολειφθέντας φησὶ ῥάβδους αὐτοῖς ἀφιερῶσαι, καὶ τὰς στήλας προσκυνεῖν, καὶ τούτοις ἑορτὰς ἄγειν κατ’ ἔτος. χρόνοις δὲ ὕστερον πολλοῖς ἀπὸ τῆς Ὑψουρανίου γενεᾶς γενέσθαι Ἀγρέα καὶ Ἁλιέα, τοὺς ἄγρας καὶ ἁλείας εὑρετᾶς,

καὶ σχεδίαν, πρῶτόν τε πάντων ἀνθρώπων πλεῦσαι· διὸ καὶ ὡς θεὸν αὐτὸν μετὰ θάνατον ἐσεβάσθησαν.

'But when Hypsuranius and Ousous were dead, those who were left, he says, consecrated staves to them, and year by year worshipped their pillars and kept festivals in their honour. But many years afterwards from the race of llypsuranius were born Agreus and Halieus, the inventors of hunting and fishing, from whom were named huntsmen and fishermen: and from them were bom two brethren, discoverers of iron and the mode of working it; the one of whom, Chrysor, practised oratory, and incantations, and divinations: and that he was Hephaestus, and invented the hook, and bait, and line, and raft, and was the first of all men to make a voyage: wherefore they reverenced him also as a god after his death.

And he was also called Zeus Meilichios. And some say that his brothers invented walls of brick. Afterwards there sprang from their race two youths, one of whom was called Technites (Artificer), and the other Geinos Autochthon (Earth-born Aboriginal). These devised the mixing of straw with the clay of bricks, and drying them in the sun, and moreover invented roofs. From them others were born, one of whom was called Agros, and the other Agrueros or Agrotes; and of the latter there is in Phoenicia a much venerated statue, and a shrine drawn by yokes of oxen; and among the people of Byblos he is named pre-eminently the greatest of the gods.
#### p13

'These two devised the addition to houses of courts, and enclosures, and caves. From them came husbandmen and huntsmen. They are also called Aletae and Titans. From these were born Amynos and Magus, who established villages and sheepfolds. From them came Misor and Suduc, that is to say "Straight " and "Just": these discovered the use of salt.
#### p14

'From Misor was born Taautus, who invented the first written alphabet; the Egyptians called him Thoyth, the Alexandrians Thoth, and the Greeks Hermes.

b

'From Suduc came the Dioscuri, or Cabeiri, or Corybantes, or Samothraces: these, he says, first invented a ship. From them have sprung others, who discovered herbs, and the healing of venomous bites, and charms. In their time is born a certain Elioun called "the Most High," and a female named Beruth, and these dwelt in the neighbourhood of Byblos.
#### p15

'And from them is born Epigeius or Autochthon, whom they afterwards called Uranus; so that from him they named the element above us Uranus because of the excellence of its beauty. And he has a sister born of the aforesaid parents, who was called Ge (earth), and from her, he says, because of her beauty, they called the earth by the same name. And their father, the Most High, died in an encounter with wild beasts, and was deified, and his children offered to him libations and sacrifices.

Let these suffice as quotations from the writings of Sanchuniathon, translated by Philo of Byblos, and approved as true by the testimony of Porphyry the philosopher.

ὁ δ’ αὐτὸς ἐν τῷ b περὶ Ἰουδαίων συγγράμματι ἔτι καὶ ταῦτα περὶ τοῦ

The same author, in his History of the Jews, further writes thus concerning Kronos:
#### p43
‟ Ταυθὸς, ὃν Αἰγύπτιοι Θωὺθ προσαγορεύουσι, σοφίᾳ διενεγκὼν παρὰ τοῖς Φοίνιξι, πρῶτος τὰ κατὰ τὴν θεοσέβειαν ἐκ τῆς τῶν χυδαίων ἀπειρίας εἰς ἐπιστημονικὴν ἐμπειρίαν διέταξεν. ᾧ μετὰ γενεὰς

'Tauthus, whom the Egyptians call Thoyth, excelled in wisdom among the Phoenicians, and was the first to rescue the worship of the gods from the ignorance of the vulgar, and arrange it in the order of intelligent experience. Many generations after him a god Sourmoubelos and Thuro, whose name was changed to Eusarthis, brought to light the theology of Tauthus which had been hidden and overshadowed, by allegories.'
#### p44
Καὶ μετὰ βραχέα φησίν

And soon after he says:

‟Ἔθος ἔθος ἦν τοῖς παλαιοῖς ἐν ταῖς μεγάλαις συμφοραῖς τῶν κινδύνων ἀντὶ τῆς πάντων φθορᾶς τὸ

'It was a custom of the ancients in great crises of danger for the rulers of a city or nation, in order to avert the common ruin, to give up the most beloved of their children for sacrifice as a ransom to the avenging daemons; and those who were thus given up were sacrificed with mystic rites. Kronos then, whom the Phoenicians call Elus, who was king of the country and subsequently, after his decease, was deified as the star Saturn, had by a nymph of the country named Anobret an only begotten son, whom they on this account called ledud, the only begotten being still so called among the Phoenicians; and when very great dangers from war had beset the country, he arrayed his son in royal apparel, and prepared an altar, and sacrificed him.'

Again see what the same author, in his translation from Sanchuniathon about the Phoenician alphabet, says concerning the reptiles and venomous beasts, which contribute no good service to mankind, but work death and destruction to any in whom they inject their incurable and fatal poison. This also he describes, saying word for word as follows:
#### p46
‟ Τὴν μὲν οὖν τοῦ δράκοντος φύσιν καὶ τῶν

ὄφενω αὐτὸς ἐξεθείασεν ὁ Ταυθὸς, καὶ μετ’ αὐτὸν αὖθις Φοίνικές τε καὶ Αἰγύπτιοι· πνευματικώτατον γὰρ τὸ ζῷον πάντων τῶν ἑρπετῶν καὶ πυρῶδες ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ παρεδόθη· παρ’ ὃ καὶ τάχος ἀνυπέρβλητον διὰ τοῦ πνεύματος παρίστησι , χωρὶς ποδῶν τε καὶ

'The nature then of the dragon and of serpents Tauthus himself regarded as divine, and so again after him did the Phoenicians and Egyptians: for this animal was declared by him to be of all reptiles most full of breath, and fiery. In consequence of which it also exerts an unsurpassable swiftness by means of its breath, without feet and hands or any other of the external members by which the other animals make their movements. It also exhibits forms of various shapes, and in its progress makes spiral leaps as swift as it chooses. 
#### p47

It is also most long-lived, and its nature is to put off its old skin, and so not only to grow young again, but also to assume a larger growth; and after it has fulfilled its appointed measure of age, it is self-consumed, in like manner as Tauthus himself has set down in his sacred books: for which reason this animal has also been adopted in temples and in mystic rites.
#### p48

'We have spoken more fully about it in the memoirs entitled Ethothiae, in which we prove that it is immortal, and is self-consumed, as is stated before: for this animal does not die by a natural death, but only if struck by a violent blow. The Phoenicians call it "Good Daemon": in like manner the Egyptians also surname it Cneph; and they add to it the head of a hawk because of the hawk's activity.

'Epeïs also (who is called among them a chief hierophant and sacred scribe, and whose work was translated [into Greek] by Areius of Heracleopolis), speaks in an allegory word for word as follows:

'The first and most divine being is a serpent with the form of a hawk, extremely graceful, which whenever he opened his eyes filled all with light in his original birthplace, but if he shut his eyes, darkness came on.'

#### p50

'Epeïs here intimates that he is also of a fiery substance, by saying "he shone through," for to shine through is peculiar to light. From the Phoenicians Pherecydes also took the first ideas of his theology concerning the god called by him Ophion and concerning the Ophionidae, of whom we shall speak again.
#### p51

θῆτα · τὸν μὲν κύκλον κόσμον μηνύοντες , τὸν δὲ μέσον ὄφιν συνεκτικὸν τούτου ἀγαθὸν δαίμονα σημαίνοντες.

'Moreover the Egyptians, describing the world from the same idea, engrave the circumference of a circle, of the colour of the sky and of fire, and a hawk-shaped serpent stretched across the middle of it, and the whole shape is like our Theta (θ), representing the circle as the world, and signifying by the serpent which connects it in the middle the good daemon.

[PORPHYRY] 'Now look at the wisdom of the Greeks, and examine it as follows. The authors of the Orphic hymns supposed Zeus to be the mind of the world, and that he created all things therein, containing the world in himself. Therefore in their theological systems they have handed down their opinions concerning him thus:  22 

Ζεὺς πρῶτος γένετο, Ζεὺς ὕστατος ἀργικέραυνος, Ζεὺς κεφαλὴ, Ζεὺς μέσσα, Δῖός δ’ ἐκ πάντα τέτυκται. Ζεὺς ἄρσην γένετο, Ζεὺς ἄφθιτος ἔπλετο νύμφη. Ζεὺς πυθμὴν γαίης τε καὶ οὐρανοῦ ἀστερόεντος.

Zeus was the first, Zeus last, the lightning's lord, 
Zeus head, Zeus centre, all things are from Zeus. 
Zeus born a male, Zeus virgin undefiled; 
Zeus the firm base of earth and starry heaven; 
Zeus sovereign, Zeus alone first cause of all: 
One power divine, great ruler of the world, 
One kingly form, encircling all things here, 
Fire, water, earth, and ether, night and day; 
Wisdom, first parent, and delightful Love: 
For in Zeus' mighty body these all lie. 
His head and beauteous face the radiant heaven 
Reveals, and round him float in shining waves 
The golden tresses of the twinkling stars. 
On either side bulls' horns of gold are seen, 
Sunrise and sunset, footpaths of the gods. 
His eyes the Sun, the Moon's responsive light; 
His mind immortal ether, sovereign truth, 
Hears and considers all; nor any speech, 
Nor cry, nor noise, nor ominous voice escapes 
The ear of Zeus, great Kronos' mightier son: 
Such his immortal head, and such his thought. 
His radiant body, boundless, undisturbed 
In strength of mighty limbs was formed thus: 
The god's broad-spreading shoulders, breast, and back 
Air's wide expanse displays; on either side 
Grow wings, wherewith throughout all space he flies. 
Earth the all-mother, with her lofty hills, 
His sacred belly forms; the swelling flood 
Of hoarse resounding Ocean girds his waist. 
His feet the deeply rooted ground upholds, 
And dismal Tartarus, and earth's utmost bounds. 
All things he hides, then from his heart again 
In godlike action brings to gladsome light.

Ζεὺς οὖν ὁ πᾶς κόσμος, ζῷον ἐκ ζῴων καὶ θεὸς
ἐκ θεῶν· Ζεὺς δὲ, καθὸ νοῦς, ἀφ᾿ οὗ προφέρει
πάντα καὶ δημιουργεῖ τοῖς νοήμασι. Τῶν δὴ θεολόγων

τὸ ζωτικὸν καὶ νοερὸν καὶ προνοητικὸν διὰ
τῆς σφαίρας ἐδείκνυεν. 

'Zeus, therefore, is the whole world, animal of animals, and god of gods; but Zeus, that is, inasmuch as he is the mind from which he brings forth all things, and by his thoughts creates them. When the theologians had explained the nature of god in this manner, to make an image such as their description indicated was neither possible, nor, if any one thought of it, could he show the look of life, and intelligence, and forethought by the figure of a sphere.

ἀνθρωπόμορφον δὲ τοῦ  Διὸς τὸ δείκηλον πεποιήκασιν, ὅτι νοῦς ἦν καθ᾿ ὃν ἐδημιούργει καὶ λόγοις σπερματικοῖς ἀπετέλει τὰ
πάντα· κάθηται δὲ, τὸ ἑδραῖον τῆς δυνάμεως αἰνιττόμενος· γυμνὰ δὲ ἔχει τὰ ἄνω, ὅτι φανερὸς ἐν τοῖς
νοεροῖς καὶ τοῖς οὐρανίοις τοῦ κόσμου μέρεςίν ἐστι· 
 σκέπεται δὲ αὐτῷ τὰ πρόσθια, ὅτι ἀφανὴς τοῖς κάτω
Κεκρυμμένοις· ἔχει δὲ τῇ μὲν λαιᾷ τὸ σκῆπτρον, καθ᾿ 
ὃ μάλιστα τῶν τοῦ σώματος μερῶν τὸ ἡγεμονικώτατόν

προτείνει δὲ τῇ δεξιᾷ ἢ ἀετὸν, ὅτι κρατεῖ τῶν ἀεροπόρων θεῶν, ὡς τῶν μεταρσίων ὀρνέων ὁ ἀετὸς, ἢ
νίκην, ὅτι νενίκηκεν αὐτὸς πάντα.” 

'But they have made the representation of Zeus in human form, because mind was that according to which he wrought, and by generative laws brought all things to completion; and he is seated, as indicating the steadfastness of his power: and his upper parts are bare, because he is manifested in the intellectual and the heavenly parts of the world; but his feet are clothed, because he is invisible in the things that lie hidden below. And he holds his sceptre in his left hand, because most close to that side of the body dwells the heart, the most commanding and intelligent organ: for the creative mind is the sovereign of the world. And in his right hand he holds forth either an eagle, because he is master of the gods who traverse the air, as the eagle is master of the birds that fly aloft----or a victory, because he is himself victorious over all things.'

Ταῦτά σοι ὁ Πορφύριος, ὧν τὸν εἰρημένον τρόπον ἀποδεδομένων ἠρέμα καὶ ἐπὶ σχολῆς ἐπιθεωρῆσαι καλὸν τίνα ποτὲ ἄρα τὸν Δία φασὶν εἷναι τὰ ἔπη. ἐγὼ μὲν γὰρ οὐδὲ ἄλλον ἡγοῦμαι ἢ τὸν ὁρώμενον κόσμον ἐκ παντοίων συνεστῶτα μερῶν, τῶν τε κατ’ οὐρανὸν καὶ αἰθέρα καὶ τῶν ἐν τούτοις φαινομένων ἄστρων, ὥσπερ ἐν μεγάλου σώματος κεφαλῇ προτεταγμένων, τῶν τε ἐν ἀέρι καὶ γῇ καὶ θαλάττῃ καὶ τοῖς παραπλησίοις. 

These things Porphyry tells you: and after they have been delivered in the manner already stated, it will be well to examine quietly and at leisure what after all the verses declare Zeus to be. I for my part think they make him to be none else than the visible world consisting of many various parts, both of those in heaven and in the ether, and of the stars which appear therein,----these being set first as in the head of a great body,----and also of the parts that lie in the air, and earth, and sea, and the like.

μέρη γοῦν κόσμου καὶ γῆ καὶ ὄρη καὶ βουνοὶ, εἱλεῖταί τε αὐτῶν ἐν μέσῳ ζώνης τρόπον ἡ θάλαττα, καὶ πῦρ δὲ καὶ ὕδωρ νύξ τε καὶ ἡμέρα τῆς αὐτῆς εἶεν ἂν τοῦ κόσμου φύσεως μέρη. ταῦτα δ’ ἄντικρυς τὸν ὁρώμενον ὑποφαίνειν ἡγοῦμαι κόσμον, εἰ μή τι καὶ σφάλλομαι, καὶ τὸ ὅλον ἐκ μερῶν συνεστὼς διδάσκει. λέγει δ’ οὖν Πάντα γὰρ ἐν μεγάλῳ Ζῆνός τάδε σώματι κεῖται. καὶ τίνα τὰ πάντα διασαφεῖ

Certainly the earth and mountains and hills are parts of the world, and the sea is rolled round in the midst of them like a girdle, and fire also and water, and night and day must be parts of the same nature of the world. These things I suppose to indicate directly the visible world, unless I am somewhat mistaken, and to show us the universe made up of various parts. He says at all events:

'For in Zeus' mighty body these all lie.'

And what 'these all' are, he clearly states:

 πῦρ καὶ ὕδωρ καὶ γαῖα καὶ αἰθὴρ , νύξ τε καὶ ἦμαρ. τοῦ δή τοι κεφαλὴν μὲν ἰδεῖν καὶ καλὰ πρόσωπα οὐρανὸς αἰγλήεις, ὃν χρύσεαι ἀμφὶς ἔθειραι ἄστρων μαρμαρέων περικαλλέες ἠερέθονται, καὶ τὰ τούτοις ἀκόλουθα· 
 
'Fire, water, earth, and ether, night and day. 
His head and beauteous face the radiant heaven 
Reveals, and round him float in shining waves 
The golden tresses of the twinkling stars.'
 
ἐν οἷς ἐπιφέρει τὸν νοῦν τοῦ Δῖός λέγων εἶναι τὸν αἰθέρα καὶ οὐδὲν ἄλλο, κατὰ τοὺς Στωϊκοὺς τὴν πυρώδη καὶ θερμὴν οὐσίαν τὸ ἡγεμονικὸν φάσκοντας εἶναι τοῦ κόσμου, καὶ τὸν θεὸν εἶναι σῶμα, καὶ τὸν δημιουργὸν αὐτὸν οὐδ’ ἕτερον τῆς τοῦ πυρὸς δυνάμεως. κατὰ τὰ αὐτὰ γὰρ οἶμαι καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἔπεσιν εἰρῆσθαι 

In the verses that follow these, he adds the statement that the mind of Zeus is the ether and nothing else, in agreement with the Stoics, who assert that the element of fire and heat is the ruling principle of the world, and that god is a body, and the Creator himself nothing else than the force of fire. For in this same sense I think it is said in the verses:

Νοῦς δέ οἱ ἀψευδὴς βασιλήϊος, ἄφθιτος αἰθὴρ, ᾧ δὴ πάντα κυκλεῖ καὶ φράζεται. 

'His mind immortal ether, sovereign truth, 
Hears and considers all.'

δι᾿ ὧν ἀνεπικαλύπτως ζῷον μέγα τὸν κόσμον
ὑποθέμενος, καὶ τοῦτον Δία προσειπὼν, νοῦν μὲν
αὐτοῦ τὸν αἰθέρα, σῶμα δὲ τὰ λοιπὰ τοῦ κόσμου μέρη 
ἀπεφήνατο εἶναι. 

Wherein without any concealment he supposed the world to be a great animal, and calling it Zeus, he represented the ether as his mind, and the remaining parts of the world as his body.

τοιοῦτος μέν τις ὁ διὰ τῶν ἐπῶν ὑπογραφόμενος τυγχάνει Ζεύς. 

Such is found to be the Zeus depicted by the verses.

ὁ δὲ τῶν ἐπῶν ἐξηγητὴς ἀρξάμενος μὲν τοῖς ἔπεσιν ἀκολούθως λέγει, Ζεὺς οὖν ὁ πᾶς κόσμος, ζῷον ἐκ ζῴων, θεὸς ἐκ θεῶν· σαφῶς τὸν θεολογούμενον Δία οὐδὲ ἄλλον ἢ τὸν ὁρώμενον καὶ αἰσθητὸν κόσμον δηλοῦσθαι διὰ τῶν ἐπῶν ἑρμηνεύσας. 

And the interpreter of the poem begins by saying, in accordance with the same, 'Zeus, therefore, is the whole world, animal of animals, god of gods;' thus clearly explaining that the Zeus of his theology is shown by the poem to be no other than the visible and sensible world.

Αἰγυπτίων δὲ ὁ λόγος, παρ᾿ ὧν καὶ Ὀρφεὺς τὴν θεολογίαν ἐκλαβὼν τὸν κόσμον εἶναι τὸν θεὸν
ᾤετο, ἐκ πλειόνων θεῶν τῶν αὐτοῦ μερῶν, (ὅτι καὶ 
τὰ μέρη τοῦ κόσμου θεολογοῦντες ἐν τοῖς πρόσθεν
ἀπεδείχθησαν,) συνεστῶτα, καὶ τούτου πλέον οὐδὲν τὰ
παρατεθέντα τῶν ἐπῶν ῥήματα διεσάφησεν. 

Now the doctrine was that of the Egyptians, from whom Orpheus took his theology, and thought that the world was the god composed of many gods who were parts of himself (for they were shown in what goes before to have also deified the parts of the world); and the statements which have been quoted from the verses declared nothing more than this.

ὁ δὲ μετὰ τὴν πρώτην ἑρμηνείαν δευτέραν ἐξ αὑτοῦ προστίθησι, τὸν τῶν ὅλων ποιητὴν θεὸν τὸν δημιουργικὸν νοῦν τοῦτον φάσκων εἶναι τὸν τεθεολογημένον. 

But Porphyry after his first interpretation adds another of his own, asserting that the God who is the Maker of the world is this creative mind which has been deified by the poet.

πῶς δ᾿ ἂν αὐτὸν τοῦτον ἐθεολόγει, ὃν μηδὲ τὴν
ἀρχὴν ἔγνω ὁ τῶν ἐπῶν ποιητὴς, εἴτε ὁ Θρᾷξ εἴη
Ὀρφεὺς εἴτε τις ἄλλος; εἰ δὴ παρ᾿ Αἰγυπτίων ἢ καὶ
τῶν πρώτων Ἑλλήνων ἥκοντα ἦν εἰς αὐτὸν τὰ τῆς 
θεολογίας , οἶ δέ γε ἀπεδείχθησαν οὐδὲν νοητὸν ἐπιστάμενοι, οὐδ᾿ ἐν ἀφανεῖ καὶ ἀσωμάτῳ οὐσίᾳ περιεχόμενον, εἴ τῳ ἱκανὸς πιστώσασθαι ὁ Πλάτων, ὁμολογῶν ἐν Κρατύλῳ τοὺς πρώτους τῶν ἀνθρώπων περὶ τὴν Ἑλλάδα τούτους μόνους θεοὺς ἡγεῖσθαι, οὕσπερ νῦν πολλοὶ τῶν βαρβάρων, ἥλιον καὶ σελήνην καὶ γῆν καὶ ἄστρα καὶ οὐρανόν. 

But how could the poet, whether he were the Thracian Orpheus or any one else, deify just this mind, of which he never knew any thing at all, if indeed his theological doctrines came to him from the Egyptians or from the primitive Greeks? For these were proved to have understood nothing ideal or comprised in invisible and incorporeal essence, if Plato's assurance may suffice us, when in the Cratylus he admits 'that the first race of men in Greece believed only in these same gods which many of the barbarians believe in now, sun, and moon, and earth, and stars, and heaven.'  23 

καὶ ὁ Χαιῥήμων δὲ μικρῷ ἔμπροσθεν ἐμαρτύρει οὐδ᾿ ἄλλο τι πρὸ τοῦ ὁρωμένου κόσμου τοὺς Αἰγυπτίους ἡγεῖσθαι, οὐδ᾿ ἄλλους θεοὺς πλὴν τῶν πλανητῶν καὶ τῶν λοιπῶν ἀστέρων, πάντα τε εἰς τὰ ὁρώμενα τοῦ κόσμου μέρη καὶ οὐδὲν εἰς ἀσωμάτους καὶ ζώσας οὐσίας ἑρμηνεύοντας.

Καὶ αὐτοῦ δὲ τοῦ Πυθαγορικοῦ φιλοσόφου, b τοῦ Νουμηνίου λέγω , ἀπὸ τοῦ πρώτου Περὶ τἀγαθοῦ τάδε παραθήσομαι

ALSO from the Pythagorean philosopher himself, I mean Numenius, I will quote as follows from his first book On the Good:

“ Εἰς δὲ τοῦτο δεήσει εἰπόντα καὶ σημηνάμενον c
ταῖς μαρτυρίαις ταῖς Πλάτωνος ἀναχωρήσασθαι καὶ ξυνδήσασθαι τοῖς λόγοις τοῦ Πυθαγόρου , 

[NUMENIUS] 8 'But when one has spoken upon this point, and sealed it by the testimonies of Plato, it will be necessary to go back and connect it with the precepts of Pythagoras, 

ἐρικαλἐσασθαι δὲ τὰ ἔθνη τὰ εὐδοκιμοῦντα, 

and to appeal to the nations of good repute, 

προσφερόμενον αὐτῶν τὰς τελετὰς καὶ τὰ δόγματα, τάς τε ἱδρύσεις συντελουμένας Πλάτωνι ὁμολογουμένως, 

bringing forward their rites and doctrines, and their institutions which are formed in agreement with those of Plato, 

ὁπόσας Βσαχμᾶνες καὶ Ἰουδαῖοι καὶ Μάγοι καὶ Αἰγύπτιοι διέθεντο

all that the Brachmans, and Jews, and Magi, and Egyptians arranged.'

Ταῦτα μὲν οὖν περὶ τῶνδε.

So much then on these points.

### c8

Καὶ ἐν τῇ τρίτῃ δὲ βίβλῳ Μώσεως ὁ αὐτὸς d τάδε λέγων μνημονεύει

ALSO in his third book the same author makes mention of Moses, speaking as follows: 9

“Τὰ δ’ ἐξῆς Ἰαννῆς καὶ Ἰαμβρῆς Αἰγύπτιοι ἱερογραμματεῖς, ἄνδρες οὐδενὸς ἥττους μαγεῦσαι κριθέντες
εἶναι, ἐπὶ Ἰουδαίων ἐξελαυνομένων ἐξ Αἰγύπτου.

'And next in order came Jannes and Jambres, Egyptian sacred scribes, men judged to have no superiors in the practice of magic, at the time when the Jews were being driven out of Egypt.

2
Μουσαίῳ γοῦν τῷ Ἰουδαίων ἐξηγησαμένῳ, ἀνδρὶ γενομένῳ θεῷ εὔξασθαι δυνατωτάτῳ, οἱ παραστῆναι ἀξιωθέντες ὑπὸ τοῦ πλήθους τοῦ τῶν Αἰγυ ττίων οὗτοι ἦσαν, τῶν τε συμφορῶν ἃς ὁ Μουσαῖος
ἐπῆγε τῇ Αἰγύπτῳ, τὰς νεανικωτάτας αὐτῶν ἐπιλύεσθαι ὤφθησαν δυνατοί.’

'So then these were the men chosen by the people of Egypt as fit to stand beside Musaeus, who led forth the Jews, a man who was most powerful in prayer to God; and of the plagues which Musaeus brought upon Egypt, these men showed themselves able to disperse the most violent.'

3
Διὰ δὴ τούτων ὁ Νουμήνιος καὶ τοῖς ὑπὸ 412 Μώσεως ἐπιIελ͂ῖ-σθ̀εῖσι παραδόξοις θαύμασι καὶ αὐτῷ δὲ ὡς θεοφιλεῖ γενομένῳ μαρτυρεῖ.

Now by these words Numenius bears witness both to the marvellous wonders performed by Moses, and to Moses himself as having been beloved of God.

AND with this agrees also Alexander Polyhistor, a man of great intellect and much learning, and very well known to those Greeks who have gathered the fruits of education in no perfunctory manner: for in his compilation, Concerning the Jews, he records the history of this man Abraham in the following manner word for word:

2
“ Εὐπόλεμος δὲ έν τῷ περὶ Ἰουδαίων τῆς Ἀδσυρίας

[ALEXANDER POLYHISTOR] 21 'Eupolemus in his book Concerning the Jews of Assyria says that the city Babylon was first founded by those who escaped from the Deluge; and that they were giants, and built the tower renowned in history.

3

ὁρμήσαντα εὐαρεστῆσαι τῷ θεῷ.

'But when this had been overthrown by the act of God, the giants were dispersed over the whole earth. And in the tenth generation, he says, in Camarina a city of Babylonia, which some call the city Uria (and which is by interpretation the city of the Chaldees), + in the thirteenth generation + Abraham was born, who surpassed all men in nobility and wisdom, who was also the inventor of astronomy and the Chaldaic art, and pleased God well by his zeal towards religion.

4
τοῦτον δὲ διὰ τὰ προστάγματα τοῦ θεοῦ εἰς Φοινίκην ἐλθόντα κα- τοικῆσαι, καὶ τροπὰς ἡλίου καὶ σελήνης καὶ τὰ ἄλλα πάντα διδάξαντα τοὺς Φοίνικας εὐαρεστῆσαι τῷ Βασιλεῖ αὐτῶν. ὕστερον δὲ Ἀρμενίους ἐπιστρατεῦσαι

'By reason of God's commands this man came and dwelt in Phoenicia, and pleased their king by teaching the Phoenicians the changes of the sun and moon and all things of that kind. And afterwards the Armenians invaded the Phoenicians; and when they had been victorious, and had taken his nephew prisoner, Abraham came to the rescue with his servants, and prevailed over the captors, and made prisoners of the wives and children of the enemy.

5

'And when there came to him ambassadors asking that he would ransom them for money, he did not choose to trample upon the unfortunate, but on receiving food for his young men restored the booty; he was also admitted as a guest into the temple of the city called Argarizin, which being interpreted is "Mount of the Most High," and received gifts from Melchizedek, who was the king, and the priest of God.

'But when there came a famine Abraham removed into Egypt with all his household, and dwelt there, and the king of Egypt took his wife in marriage, Abraham having said that she was his sister.

'He also related fully that the king was unable to consort with her, and that it came to pass that his people and his household were perishing. And when he had called for the soothsayers, they said that the woman was not a widow; and thus the king of Egypt learned that she was Abraham's wife, and gave her back to her husband.

'And Abraham dwelt with the Egyptian priests in Heliopolis and taught them many things; and it was he who introduced astronomy and the other sciences to them, saying that the Babylonians and himself had found these things out, but tracing back the first discovery to Enoch, and saying that he, and not the Egyptians, had first invented astrology.

'For the Babylonians say that the first man was Belus, who is Kronos; and that of him was born a son Belus, and Chanaan; and that this Chanaan begat the father of the Phoenicians, and that his son was Churn, who is called by the Greeks Asbolus, and is father of the Aethiopians, and a brother of Mestraim the father of the Egyptians. But the Greeks say that Atlas invented astrology, and that Atlas is the same as Enoch: and that Enoch had a son Methuselah, who learned all things through angels of God, and thus we gained our knowledge.'

### c27

'AND Artapanus says, in his book Concerning the Jews, that after the death of Abraham, and of his son Mempsasthenoth, and likewise of the king of Egypt, his son Palmanothes succeeded to the sovereignty.

2

'This king behaved badly to the Jews; and first he built Kessa, and founded the temple therein, and then built the temple in Heliopolis.

3

'He begat a daughter Merris, whom he betrothed to a certain Chenephres, king of the regions above Memphis (for there were at that time many kings in Egypt); and she being barren took a supposititious child from one of the Jews, and called him Mouses (Moses): but by the Greeks he was called, when grown to manhood, Musaeus.

4

'And this Moses, they said, was the teacher of Orpheus; and when grown up he taught mankind many useful things. For he was the inventor of ships, and machines for laying stones, and Egyptian arms, and engines for drawing water and for war, and invented philosophy. Further he divided the State into thirty-six Nomes, and. appointed the god to be worshipped by each Nome, and the sacred writing for the priests, and their gods were cats, and dogs, and ibises: he also apportioned an especial district for the priests.

5
ταῦτα δὲ πάντα ποιῆσαι χάριν τοῦ τὴν μοναρχίαν βεβαίαν τῷ Χενεφρῇ διαφυλάξαι. πρότερον γὰρ ἀδιατάκτους ὄντας τοὺς ὄχλους ποτὲ μὲν ἐκβάλλειν, ποτὲ δὲ καθιστάνειν βασιλεῖς, καὶ πολλάκις μὲν τοὺς αὐτοὺς, ἐνιάκις δὲ ἄλλους.

'All these things he did for the sake of keeping the sovereignty firm and safe for Chenepbres. For previously the multitudes, being under no order, now expelled and now set up kings, often the same persons, but sometimes others.

6
διὰ ταῦτα οὖν τὸν Μώϋσον

'For these reasons then Moses was beloved by the multitudes, and being deemed by the priests worthy to be honoured like a god, was named Hermes, because of his interpretation of the Hieroglyphics.

'But when Chenephres perceived the excellence of Moses he envied him, and sought to slay him on some plausible pretext. And so when the Aethiopians invaded Egypt, Chenephres supposed that he had found a convenient opportunity, and sent Moses in command of a force against them, and enrolled the body of husbandmen for him, supposing that through the weakness of his troops he would easily be destroyed by the enemy.

8
τὸν δὲ Μώϋσον ἐλθόντα ἐπὶ τὸν ‘Eρμοπολίτην ὀνομαζόμενον νομὸν, ἔχοντα

'But Moses with about a hundred thousand of the husbandmen came to the so-called Nome of Hermopolis, and there encamped; and sent generals to pre-occupy the country, who gained remarkable successes in their battles. He adds that the people of Heliopolis say that this war went on for ten years.

9

'So Moses, because of the greatness of his army, built a city in this place, and therein consecrated the ibis, because this bird kills the animals that are noxious to man. And he called it Hermes' city.

10
οὕτω δὴ τοὺς Αἰθίοπας , καίπερ ὄντας πολεμίους , στέρξαι τὸν Μώϋσον ὥστε καὶ τὴν περιτομὴν τῶν αἰδοίων παρ’ ἐκείνου μαθεῖν· οὐ μόνον δὲ τούτους, ἀλλὰ καὶ τοὺς ἱερεῖς ἅπαντας.

'Thus then the Aethiopians, though they were enemies, became so fond of Moses, that they even learned from him the custom of circumcision: and not they only, but also all the priests.

11
τὸν δὲ Χενεφρῆν , λυθέντος τοῦ πολέμου, λόγῳ μὲν αὐτὸν ἀποδέξασθαι, ἔργῳ δὲ ἐπιβουλεύειν. παρελόμενον γοῦν αὐτοῦ τοὺς ὄχλους τοὺς μὲν ἐπὶ τὰ ὅρια τῆς Αἰθιοπίας πέμψαι προφυλακῆς χάριν, τοῖς δὲ προστάξαι τὸν ἐν Δῖός πόλει ναὸν ἐξ ὀπτῆς πλίνθου κατεσκευασμένον καθαιρεῖν , ἕτερον δὲ λίθινον κατασκευάσαι τὸ πλησίον ὄρος λατομήσαντας ’ τάξαι

'But when the war was ended, Chenephres pretended to welcome him, while in reality continuing to plot against him. So he took his troops from him, and sent some to the frontiers of Aethiopia for an advanced guard; and ordered others to demolish the temple in Diospolis which had been built of baked brick, and build another of stone from the quarries of the neighbouring mountain, and appointed Nacheros superintendent of the building.

τὸν δὲ ἐλθόντα μετὰ Μωΰσου εἰς Μέμφιν πυθέσθαι παρ’ αὐτοῦ εἴ τι ἄλλο ἐστὶν εὔχρηστον τοῖς ἀνθρώποις· τὸν δὲ φάναι γένος τῶν βοῶν, διὰ τὸ τὴν γῆν ὑπὸ τούτων ἀροῦσθαι· τὸν δὲ Χενεφρῆν, προσαγορεὐσαντα
ταῦρον Ἄπιν, κελεῦσαι ἱερὸν αὐτοῦ τοὺς ὄχλους καθιδρύσασθαι, καὶ τὰ ζῷα τὰ καθιερωθέντα v.1.p.501 ὑπὸ τοῦ Μωΰσου κελεύειν ἐκεῖ φέροντας θάπτειν, κατακρύπτειν θέλοντα τὰ τοῦ Μωΰσου ἐπινοήματα.

'And when he was come with Moses to Memphis, he asked him whether there was anything else useful for mankind, and he said the breed of oxen, because by means of them the land is ploughed: and Chenephres having given the name Apis to a bull, commanded the troops to found a temple for him, and bade them bring and bury there the animals which had been consecrated by Moses, because he wished to bury the inventions of Moses in oblivion. 

13
ἀποξενωσάντων δὲ αὐτὸν τῶν Αἰγυπτίων ὁρκωμοτῆσαι τοὺς φίλους μὴ ἐξαγγεῖλαι τῷ Μωΰσῳ τὴν
ἐπισυνισταμένην αὐτῷ ἐπιβουλὴν καὶ προβαλέσθαι τοὺς ἀναιρήσοντας αὐτόν.

'But when the Egyptians were alienated from him, he bound his friends by an oath not to report to Moses the plot which was being contrived against him, and he appointed the men who were to kill him.

14
μηδενὸς δ ὑπακούσαντος ὀνειδίσαι τὸν Χενεφρῆν Χανεθώθην, τὸν μάλιστα προσαγορευόμενον ὑπ αὐτοῦ· τὸν δὲ ὀνειδισθέντα ὑποσχέσθαι τὴν ἐπίθεσιν, λαβόντα καιρόν.

'When however no one would obey him, Chenephres reproached Chanethothes, whom he had especially addressed; and he, on being thus reproached, promised to make the attempt when he found an opportunity.


15
ὑπὸ δὲ τοῦτον τὸν καιρὸν τῆς Μέρριδος τελευτησάσης ὑποσχέσθαι τὸν Χενεφρὴν τῷ τε Μωΰσῳ καὶ τῷ Χανεθώθῃ τὸ σῶμα διακομίσαντας εἰς τοὺς ὑπὲρ Αἴγυπτον τόπους θάψαι, ὑπολαβόντα τὸν Μώ-

d
ϋσον ὑπὸ τοῦ Χανεθὼθ ἀναιρεθήσεσθαι.

'And Merris having died about this time, Chenephres professed to give the body to Moses and Chanethothes to carry it over into regions beyond Egypt and bury it, supposing that Moses would be slain by Chanethothes.

16
πορευομένων
δὲ αὐτῶν τὴν ἐπιβουλὴν τῷ Μωΰσῳ τῶν συνειδότων ἐξαγγεῖλαί τινα· τὸν δὲ φυλάσσοντα αὐτὸν τὴν μὲν Μέρριν θάψαι, τὸν δὲ ποταμὸν καὶ τὴν ἐν ἐκείνῳ πόλιν Μερόην προσαγορεῦσαι. τιμᾶσθαι δὲ τὴν Μέρριν ταύτην ὑπὸ τῶν ἐγχωρίων οὐκ
ἔλαττον ἢ τὴν Ἶσιν.

'But while they were on the way, one of those who were cognizant of the plot reported it to Moses; and he being on his guard buried Merris himself, and called the river and the city thereby Meroe. And this Merris is honoured by the people of the country not less highly than Isis.

17
Ἀάρωνα δὲ τὸν τοῦ Μωΰσου ἀδελφὸν τὰ περὶ τὴν ἐπιβουλὴν ἐπιγνόντα συμβουλεῦσαι τῷ ἀδελφῷ φυγεῖν εἰς τὴν Ἀραβίαν· τὸν δὲ πεισθέντα, ἀπὸ Μέμφεως τὸν Νεῖλον διαπλεύσαντα, ἀπαλλάσσεσθαι εἰς τὴν Ἀραβίαν.

'Then Aaron the brother of Moses, having learned about the plot, advised his brother to flee into Arabia; and he took the advice, and sailed across the Nile from Memphis, intending to escape into Arabia.

18
τὸν δὲ Χανεθώθην

434

πυθόμενον τοῦ Μωΰσου τὴν φυγὴν ἐνεδρεύειν ὡς ἀναιρήσοντα· ἰδόντα δὲ ἐρχόμενον σπάσασθαι τὴν μάχαιραν ἐπ αὐτὸν, τὸν δὲ Μώϋσον προκαταταχήσαντα τήν τε χεῖρα κατασχεῖν αὐτοῦ καὶ σπασάμενον τὸ ξίφος φονεῦσαι τὸν Χανεθώθην·

'But when Chanethothes was informed of the flight of Moses, he lay in ambush intending to kill him; and when he saw him coming, he drew his sword against him, but Moses was too quick for him, and seized his hand, and drew his sword and slew Chanethothes.

19
διεκδρᾶναι δὲ εἰς τὴν Ἀραβίαν, καὶ Ραγουήλῳ τῷ τῶν τόπων ἄρχοντι συμβιοῦν, λαβόντα τὴν ἐκείνου θυγατέρα· τὸν δὲ Ραγουῆλον βούλεσθαι στρα-

λῃστεύειν τὴν Αἴγυπτον.

'So he made his escape into Arabia, and lived with Raguel the ruler of the district, having married his daughter. And Raguel wished to make an expedition against the Egyptians in order to restore Moses, and procure the government for his daughter and son-in-law; but Moses prevented it, out of regard for his own nation: and Raguel forbidding him to march against the Arabs, ordered him to plunder Egypt.

20
ὑπὸ δὲ τὸν αὐτὸν χρόνον καὶ τὸν Χενεφρῆν πρῶτον ἁπάντων ἀνθρώπων ἐλεφαντιάσαντα μεταλλάξαι ’ τούτῳ δὲ τῷ πάθει περιπεσεῖν διὰ τὸ τοὺς Ἰουδαίους προσ- τάξαι σινδόνας ἀμφιέννυσθαι , ἐρεᾶν δ’ ἐσθῆτα μὴ ἀμπέχεσθαι, ὅπως ὄντες ἐπίσημοι κολάζωνται ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ.

'About the same time Chenephres died, having been the very first person attacked by elephantiasis; and he is said to have incurred this misfortune because he ordered the Jews to wear linen garments and not to wear woollen clothing, in order that they might be conspicuous, and be punished by him.

21
τὸν δὲ Μώϋσον εὔχεσθαι τῷ θεῷ, ἤδη ποτὲ τοὺς λαοὺς παῦσαι τῶν κακοπαθειῶν. ἱλασκομένου δ’ αὐτοῦ αἰφνιδίως φησὶν ἐκ τῆς γῆς πῦρ ἀναφθῆναι, καὶ τοῦτο κάεσθαι, μήτε ὕλης μήτε ἄλλης
τινὸς ξυλείας οὔσης ἐν τῷ τόπῳ. τὸν δὲ Μώϋσον δείσαντα τὸ γεγονὸς φεύγειν· φωνὴν δ’ αὐτῷ θείαν εἰπεῖν στρατεύειν ἐπ’ Αἴγυπτον , καὶ τοὺς Ἰουδαίους διασώσαντα εἰς τὴν ἀρχαίαν ἀγαγεῖν πατρίδα.

'But Moses prayed to God now at last to put an end to the sufferings of the tribes. And God being propitiated, fire, it is said, suddenly blazed up out of the earth, and went on burning though there was no wood nor any other fuel in the place. And Moses was frightened at the occurrence and took to flight; but a divine voice spake to him, to march against Egypt, and rescue the Jews and lead them into their old country.

22
τὸν δὲ θαρρήσαντα δύναμιν πολεμίαν ἐπάγειν διαγνῶναι
τοῖς Αἰγυπτίοις. πρῶτον δὲ πρὸς Ἀάρωνα τὸν ἀδελφὸν ἐλθεῖν· τὸν δὲ βασιλέα τῶν Αἰγυπτίων πυθόμενον

d

ἀπολῦσαι τοὺς Ἰουδαίους.

'So he took courage and determined to lead a hostile force against the Egyptians: but first he came to his brother Aaron. And when the king of Egypt heard of the arrival of Moses, he called him before him, and asked what he had come for: and he said, Because the Lord of the world commanded him to deliver the Jews.

23
τὸν δὲ πυθόμενον εἰς φυλακὴν αὐτὸν καθεῖρξαι. νυκτὸς δὲ ἐπιγενομένης

254
τάς τε θύρας πάσας αὐτομάτως ἀνοιχθῆναι τοῦ δεσμωτηρίου καὶ τῶν φυλάκων οὓς μὲν τελευτῆσαι, τινὰς δὲ ὑπὸ τοῦ ὕπνου παρεθῆναι, τά τε ὅπλα κατεαγῆαι.

'And when the king heard this, he shut him up in prison. But when it was night, all the doors of the prison-house opened of their own accord, and of the guards some died, and some were sunk in sleep, and their weapons broken in pieces.'

24
ἐξελθόντα δὲ τὸν Μώϋσον ἐπὶ τὰ βασίλεια ἐλθεῖν· εὑρόντα δὲ ἀνεῳγμένας τὰς θύρας

435
θεοῦ εἰπεῖν ὄνομα, διαχλευάσαντα αὐτόν·

'So Moses passed out and came to the palace; and finding the doors opened he went in, and the guards here also being sunk in sleep he woke up the king. And he being dismayed at what had happened bade Moses tell him the name of the God who sent him, scoffing at him: 

25
τὸν δὲ
προσκύψαντα πρὸς τὸ οὖς εἰπεῖν, ἀκούσαντα δὲ τὸν βασιλέα πεσεῖν ἄφωνον, διακρατηθέντα δὲ ὑπὸ τοῦ Μωΰσου πάλιν ἀναβιῶσαι·

but Moses bent down and whispered in his ear, and when the king heard it he fell speechless, but was held fast by Moses and came to life again.

26
γράψαντα δὲ τοὔνομα εἰς δέλτον κατασφραγίσασθαι· τῶν δὲ ἱερέων τὸν ἐκφαυλίσαντα ἐν τῇ πινακίδι τὰ γεγραμμένα μετὰ
σπασμοῦ τὸν βίον ἐκλιμπάνειν·

'And he wrote the name in a tablet and sealed it up; and one of the priests who made light of what was written in the tablet was seized with a convulsion and died.'

27
εἰπεῖν τε τὸν βασιλέα σημεῖόν τι αὐτῷ ποιήσαι· τὸν δὲ Μώϋσον ἣν εἶχε ῥάβδον ἐκβαλόντα ὄφιν ποιῆσαι ’ πτοηθέντων

b
δὲ πάντων, ἐπιλαβόμενον τῆς οὐρᾶς ἀνελέσθαι, καὶ πάλιν ῥάβδον ποιῆσαι·

'Also the king told him to work some sign for him, and Moses threw down the rod which he held and turned it into a serpent; and when they were all frightened, he seized it by the tail and took it up, and made it a rod again.

28
προελθόντα δὲ μικρὸν
τὸν Νεῖλον τῇ ῥάβδῳ πατάξαι ’ τὸν δὲ ποταμὸν πολύχουν γενόμενον κατακλύζειν ὅλην τὴν Αἴγυπτον· ἀπὸ τότε δὲ καὶ τὴν κατάβασιν αὐτοῦ γίνεσθαι· συναγαγὸν δὲ τὸ ὕδωρ ἀποζέσαι καὶ τὰ ποτάμια διαφθεῖραι ζῷα, τούς τε λαοὺς διὰ τὴν δίψαν φθείρεσθαι.

'Then he went forth a little, and smote the Nile with the rod, and the river became flooded and deluged the whole of Egypt, and it was from that time its inundation began: and the water became stagnant, and stank, and killed all living things in the river, and the people were perishing of thirst.

29
τὸν δὲ βασιλέα, τούτων γενομένων τῶν τεράτων, φάναι μετὰ μῆνα τοὺς λαοὺς ἀπολύσειν, ἐὰν ἀποκαταστήσῃ τὸν ποταμόν ’ τὸν δὲ Μώϋσον

c
πάλιν τῇ ῥάβδῳ πατάξαντα τὸ ὕδωρ συστεῖλαι τὸ ῥεῦμα.

'But when these wonders had been wrought, the king said that after a month he would let the people go, if Moses would restore the river to its proper state; and he smote the water again with his rod, and checked the stream.

30
τούτου δὲ γενομένου τὸν βασιλέα τοὺς
ἱερεῖς τοὺς ὑπὲρ Μέμφιν καλέσαι, καὶ φάναι αὐτοὺς ἀναιρήσειν, καὶ τὰ ἱερὰ κατασκάψειν, ἐὰν μὴ καὶ αὐτοὶ τερατουργήσωσί τι. τοὺς δὲ τότε διά τινων μαγγάνων καὶ ἐπαοιδῶν δράκοντα ποιῆσαι καὶ τὸν ποταμὸν μεταχρῶσαι.

'When this was done, the king summoned the priests from above Memphis, and said that he would kill them all, and demolish the temples, unless they also would work some wonder. And then they by some witchcraft and incantations made a serpent, and changed the colour of the river.

31
τὸν δὲ βασιλέα φρονηματισθέντα
ἐπὶ τῷ γεγονότι, πάσῃ τιμωρίᾳ καὶ κολάσει καταικίζειν τοὺς Ἰουδαίους. τὸν δὲ Μώϋσον ταῦτα ὁρῶντα ἄλλα τε σημεῖα ποιήσαι καὶ πατάξαντα τὴν

τοὺς Αἰγυπτίους, πάντα τε ἐξελκωθῆναι τὰ σώματα. τῶν δὲ ἰατρῶν μὴ δυναμένων ἰᾶσθαι τοὺς κάμνοντας, οὕτω πάλιν ἀνέσεως τυχεῖν τοὺς Ἰουδαίους.

'And the king, being puffed up with pride at what was done, began to maltreat the Jews with every kind of vengeance and punishment. Then Moses, seeing this, both wrought other signs, and also smote the earth with his rod, and brought up a kind of winged animal to harass the Egyptians, and all their bodies broke out in boils. And as the physicians were unable to heal the sufferers, the Jews thus again gained relief.

32
πάλιν τε τὸν Μώϋσον βάτραχον διὰ τῆς ῥάβδου
ἀνεῖναι, πρὸς δὲ τούτοις ἀκρίδας καὶ σκνίφας. διὰ τοῦτο δὲ καὶ τοὺς Αἰγυπτίους τὴν ῥάβδον ἀνατιθέναι εἰς πὰν ἱερὸν, ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ τῇ Ἴσιδι, διὰ τὸ τὴν γῆν εἶναι Ἰσιν, παιομένην δὲ τῇ ῥάβδῳ τὰ τέρατα ἀνεῖναι.

'Again Moses by his rod brought up frogs, and besides them locusts and lice. And for this reason the Egyptians dedicate the rod in every temple, and to Isis likewise, because the earth is Isis, and sent up these wonders when smitten by the rod.

33
τοῦ δὲ βασιλέως ἔτι ἀφρονουμένου τὸν
Μώϋσον χάλαζάν τε καὶ σεισμοὺς διὰ νυκτὸς ἀποτελέσαι, ὥστε τοὺς τὸν σεισμὸν φεύγοντας ἀπὸ τῆς χαλάζης ἀναιρεῖσθαι, τούς τε τὴν χάλαζαν ἐκκλίνοντας

436
ὑπὸ τῶν σεισμῶν διαφθείρεσθαι. συμπεσεῖν δὲ τότε τὰς μὲν οἰκίας πάσας τῶν τε ναῶν τοὺς πλείστους.

'But as the king still persisted in his folly, Moses caused hail and earthquakes by night, so that those who fled from the earthquake were killed by the hail, and those who sought shelter from the hail were destroyed by the earthquakes. And at that time all the houses fell in, and most of the temples.

34
τελευταῖον τοιαύταις συμφοραῖς περιπεσόντα τὸν βασιλέα τοὺς Ἰουδαίους ἀπολῦσαι ’ τοὺς δὲ χρησαμένους παρὰ τῶν Αἰγυπτίων πολλὰ μὲν ἐκπώματα, οὐκ ὀλίγον δὲ ἱματισμὸν ἄλλην τε παμπληθῆ γάζαν, διαβάντας τοὺς κατὰ τὴν Ἀραβίαν
ποταμοὺς, καὶ διαβάντας ἱκανὸν τόπον ἐπὶ τὴν ἐρυθρὰν τριταίους ἐλθεῖν θάλασσαν.


'At last after having incurred such calamities the king let the Jews go: and they, after borrowing from the Egyptians many drinking-vessels, and no little raiment, and very much other treasure, crossed the rivers on the Arabian side, and after traversing a wide space came on the third day to the Red Sea.

35
Μεμφίτας μὲν οὖν λέγειν ἔμπειρον ὄντα τὸν Μώϋσον τῆς χώρας

b
τὴν ἄμπωτιν τηρήσαντα διὰ ξηρᾶς τῆς θαλάσσης τὸ πλῆθος περαιῶσαι. Ἡλιουπολίτας δὲ λέγειν ἐπικαταδραμεῖν

255
διακομίζειν.

'Now the people of Memphis say, that Moses being acquainted with the country waited for the ebb, and took the people across the sea when dry. But the people of Heliopolis say, that the king hastened after them with a great force, having also with him the consecrated animals, because the Jews were carrying off the property which they had borrowed from the Egyptians.

36
τῷ δὲ Μωΰσῳ θείαν φωνὴν γενέσθαι πατάξαι τὴν θάλασσαν τῇ ῥάβδῳ καὶ διαστῆναι.
τὸν δὲ Μώϋσον ἀκούσαντα ἐπιθιγεῖν τῇ ῥάβδῳ τοῦ ὕδατος, καὶ οὕτω τὸ μὲν νᾶμα διαστῆναι, τὴν δὲ

v.1.p.505
δύναμιν διὰ ξηρᾶς ὁδοῦ πορεύεσθαι.

'There came, however, to Moses a divine voice bidding him to smite the sea with the rod [and that it should divide]: and when Moses heard it, he touched the water with the rod, and so the stream divided, and the force passed over by a dry path.

37
συνεμβάντων

ἐννέα.”

'But when the Egyptians went in with them and were pursuing them, a fire, it is said, shone out upon them from the front, and the sea overflowed the path again, and the Egyptians were all destroyed by the fire and the flood: but the Jews having escaped this danger spent forty years in the wilderness, God raining down meal for them like millet, similar in colour to snow. And Moses they say was tall and ruddy, with long white hair, and dignified: and he performed these deeds when he was about eighty-nine years old.'

'WITH regard to Moses being exposed by his mother in the marsh, and taken up and reared by the king's daughter, Ezekiel the tragic poet gives an account, taking up the narrative from the beginning when Jacob and his family came into Egypt to Joseph. And he tells it as follows, bringing Moses forward as the speaker: 30

"When Jacob from the land of Canaan down 
To Egypt came, with threescore souls and ten, 
He there begat a multitudinous race, 
Who much endured and long, by wicked men 
And tyrant's hand to this our day crushed down. 
For when he saw our people had waxed strong, 
The king with subtle craft our fathers ruled, 
And some in making bricks ho sore oppressed, 
And some in raising heavy stones to build 
His lofty towers, for their despite contrived. 
Next he commands that all the Hebrew race 
Cast every man-child in the Nile's deep flood. 
And I have often heard my mother tell, 
How at that time she hid me for three months: 
Fearing detection then, she wrapped me close 
In rough attire, and laid me secretly 
'Mid the thick rushes by the river's bank. 
My sister Miriam close at hand kept watch, 
Till Pharaoh's daughter with her maids came down 
To bathe her shining limbs in the cool stream. 
She saw the babe, and straightway took it up,
And knew its Hebrew birth. My sister then 
Ran up, and to the princess thus she spake: 
'Wilt thou I find as nurse for this fair child 
Some Hebrew wife?' The princess bade her speed, 
And to her mother quick she told the tale, 
Who came with speed, and took me in her arms. 
Then spake the Pharaoh's daughter, 'Take this child 
To nurse, good dame, and I will pay thy wage.' 
'Moses' the name she gave, to mark the fact 
That from the river's brink she drew me forth."

'To this farther on in the tragedy Ezekiel adds more on the following points, bringing Moses forward as speaking:

ἦγέν με μήτηρ βασιλίδος πρὸς δώματα,

"So when my time of infancy was past, 
My mother led me to the princess' home, 
But first she told me all the tale, my birth 
And kindred, and God's gifts of old. 
The princess then through all my boyhood's years, 
As I had been a son of her own womb, 
In royal state and learning nurtured me. 
But when the circle of the days was full, 
I left the palace, urged to lofty deeds 
By my own soul, and by the king's device. 
Then the first day I saw two men at strife, 
Egyptian one, and one of Hebrew race. 
And when I saw that we were quite alone, 
None else in sight, I to the rescue came, 
Avenged my kinsman, and the Egyptian slew, 
And buried in the sand, that none might see 
What we had ventured, and lay bare the deed. 
But on the morrow's dawn again I saw 
Two of our kin in deadly strife, and cried, 
'Why smitest thou thy weaker brother thus?' 
But he replied, 'And who made thee a judge, 
Or ruler here? Me also wouldest thou slay, 
As that man yestermorn?' Then to myself 
In fear I said, 'How came that deed abroad?' 
All this was quickly carried to the king. 
And Pharaoh sought to take away my life. 
His plot I learned, and from his hands escaped, 
And now to other lands am wandering forth."

εἶτα περὶ τῶν τοῦ Ραγουὴλ θυγατέρων οὕτως ἐπιβάλλει,

'Then, concerning the daughters of Raguel he adds this: 

ὁρῶ δὲ ταύτας ἑπτὰ παρθένους τινάς.

"But here, behold! some seven fair maids I see."

ἐρωτήσαντός τε αὐτὰς τίνες εἴησαν αἱ παρθένοι φησὶν ἡ Σεπφώρα

'And on his asking them what maidens they were, Zipporah replies:

Λιβύη μὲν ἡ γῆ πᾶσα κλῄζεται, ξένε,
οἰκοῦσι δ αὐτὴν φῦλα παντοίων γενῶν,
Αἰθίοπες ἄνδρες μέλανες· ἄρχων δ ἐστὶ γῆς

"The land, O stranger, bears the common name 
Of Libya, but by various tribes is held 
Of dark-skinned Aethiops: yet the land is ruled 
By one sole monarch, and sole chief in war. 
This city has for ruler and for judge 
A priest, the father of myself and these."

εἶτα περὶ τοῦ ποτισμοῦ τῶν θρεμμάτων διελθὼν περὶ τοῦ τῆς Σεπφώρας ἐπιβάλλει γάμου, δι ἀμοιβαίων παρεισάγων τόν τε Χοὺμ καὶ τὴν Σεπφώραν λέγοντας,

'He then describes the giving drink to the cattle, and adds the account of his marriage with Zipporah, bringing forward Chum and Zipporah as speaking in alternate verses:

Σ. ὅμως κατειπεῖν χρή σε, Σεπφώρα, τάδε.
Χ. ξένῳ πατήρ με τῷδ ἔδωκεν εὐνέτιν.”

"Ch. 'Yet this thou need'st must tell me, Zipporah.' 
Z. 'My father gave me for this stranger's wife.'

### c29
“Δημήτριος δὲ περὶ τῆς ἀναιρέσεως τοῦ Αἰγυπτίου καὶ τῆς διαφορᾶς τῆς πρὸς τὸν μηνύσαντα τὸν τελευτήσαντα ὁμοίως τῷ τὴν ἱερὰν βίβλον
γράψαντι ἱστόρησε· φυγεῖν μέντοι γε τὸν Μωσῆν εἰς Μαδιὰν, καὶ συνοικῆσαι ἐκεῖ τῇ Ἰοθὸρ θυγατρὶ Σεπφώρᾳ, ἣν εἶναι, ὅσα στοχάζεσθαι ἀπὸ τῶν ὀνομάτων, τῶν γενομένων ἐκ Χεττούρας, τοῦ Ἀβραὰμ γένους, ἐκ τοῦ Ἰεζὰν τοῦ γενομένου Ἀβραὰμ ἐκ Χεττούρας· v.1.p.508 ἐκ δὲ τοῦ Ἰεζὰν γενέσθαι Δαδὰν, ἐκ δὲ Δαδὰν γουὴλ , ἐκ δὲ Ῥαγουὴλ Ἰοθὸρ καὶ Ἀβὰβ, , ἐκ δὲ tov Ἰοθὸρ Σεπφώραν , ἣν γήμαι Μωσῆν.

'DEMETRIUS described the slaying of the Egyptian, and the quarrel with him who gave information about the deceased man, in the same way as the writer of the Sacred Book. He says, however, that Moses fled into Midian, and there married Zipporah the daughter of Jothor, who was, as far as one may conjecture from the names, one of the descendants of Keturah, of the stock of Abraham, from Jexan who was the son of Abraham by Keturah: and from Jexan was born Dadan, and from Dadan Raguel, and from Raguel, Jothor, and Hobab: and from Jothor Zipporah, whom Moses married.

2
καὶ τὰς γενεὰς δὲ συμφωνεῖν· τὸν γὰρ Μωσῆν εἶναι ἀπὸ d Ἀβραὰμ ἕβδομον , τὴν δὲ Σεπφώραν ἕκτην. συνοικουντος γὰρ ἤδη τοῦ Ἰσαὰκ, ἀφ’ οὗ Μωσῆν εἶναι, γῆμαι Ἀβραὰμ τὴν Χεττούραν ὄντα ἐτῶν ρμ, καὶ γεννῆσαι Ἰσαὰρ ἐξ αὐτῆς δεύτερον· τὸν δὲ Ἰσαὰκ, ὄντα ἐτῶν ἑκατὸν, γεννῆσαι. ὥστε μβ ἐτῶν ὕστερον γεγονέναι τὸν Ἰσαὰρ, ἀφ’ οὗ τὴν Σεπφώραν γεγενεαλογῆσθαι.

'The generations also agree; for Moses was seventh from Abraham, and Zipporah sixth. For Isaac, from whom Moses descended, was already married when Abraham at the age of a hundred and forty married Keturah, and begat by her a second son Isaar. Now he begat Isaac when he was a hundred years old; so that Isaar, from whom Zipporah derived her descent, was born forty-two years later than Isaac.

3
οὐδὲν οὑν ἀντιπίπτει τὸν Μωσῆν καὶ τὴν Σεπφώραν κατὰ τοὺς αὐτοὺς γεγονέναι χρόνους. κατοικεῖν δ’ αὐτοὺς Μαδιὰμ πόλιν, ἣν ἀπὸ ἑνὸς τῶν Ἀβραὰμ παίδων ὀνομασθῆναι. φησὶ γὰρ τὸν Ἀβραὰμ τοὺς παῖδας πρὸς ἀνατολὰς ἐπὶ κατοικίαν πέμψαι ·
διὰ τοῦτο δὲ καὶ Ἀαρὼν καὶ Μαριὰμ εἰπεῖν ἐν Ἀσηρὼθ Μωσῆν Αἰθιοπίδα γῆμαι γυναῖκα.

'There is therefore no inconsistency in Moses and Zipporah having lived at the same time. And they dwelt in the city Madiam, which was called from one of the sons of Abraham. For it says that Abraham sent his sons towards the East to find a dwelling-place: for this reason also Aaron and Miriam said at Hazeroth that Moses had married an Aethiopian woman.

4
λέγει δὲ περὶ τούτων καὶ Ἐζεκιῆλος ἐν τῇ Ἐξαγωγῇ, προσπαρειληφως τὸν ὄνειρον τὸν ὑπὸ Μώσεως μὲν ἑωραμένον, ὑπὸ δὲ πενθεροῦ διακεκριμένον. λέγει δὲ  αὐτὸς ὁ Μώσης δι’ ἀμοιβαίων πρὸς τὸν πενθερὸν οὐτῶ πως

'Ezekiel also speaks of this in the Exodus, adding to the tradition the dream that was seen by Moses and interpreted by his father-in-law. And Moses himself talks with his father-in-law in alternate verses, as follows:  31

5
ἔδοξ’ ὄρους κατ’ ἄκρα Σιναίου θρόνον
μέγαν τιν’ εἶναι μέχρις οὐρανοῦ πτυχὸς,
ἐν ᾧ καθῆσθαι φῶτα γενναῖόν τινα

b
σκῆπτρον δέ μοι παρέδωκε, κεἰς θρόνον μέγαν
εἶπεν καθῆσθαι· βασιλικὸν δ’ ἔδωκέ μοι

διάδημα, καὐτὸς ἐκ θρόνων χωρίζεται.
• ἐγὼ δ’ ἐσεῖδον γῆν ἅπασαν ἔγκυκλον,
κανερθε γαίας καξύπερθεν οὐρανοῦ,
καί μοί τι πλῆθος ἀστέρων πρὸς γούνατα
v.1.p.509
ἔπιπτ’, ἐγὼ δὲ πάντας ἠριθμησάμην,
κἀμοὶ παρῆγεν ὡς παρεμβολὴ βροτῶν.
c
εἶτ’ ἐμφοβηθεὶς ἐξανίσταμ’ ἐξ ὕπνου.


"Methought upon Mount Sinai's brow I saw 
A mighty throne that reached to heaven's high vault, 
Whereon there sat a man of noblest mien 
Wearing a royal crown; whose left hand held 
A mighty sceptre; and his right to me 
Made sign, and I stood forth before the throne. 
He gave me then the sceptre and the crown, 
And bade me sit upon the royal throne, 
From which himself removed. Thence I looked forth 
Upon the earth's wide circle, and beneath 
The earth itself, and high above the heaven. 
Then at my feet, behold! a thousand stars 
Began to fall, and I their number told, 
As they passed by me like an armed host: 
And I in terror started up from sleep."

6
ὁ δὲ πενθερὸς αὐτοῦ τὸν ὄνειρον ἐπικρίνει οὕτως

ὢ ξένε, καλόν σοι τοῦτ’ ἐσήμηνεν θεός ·
ζώοιν δ’ ὅταν σοι ταῦτα συμβαίνῃ ποτέ.
ἆρά γε μέγαν τιν’ ἐξαναστήσεις θρόνον,
καὐτὸς βραβεύσεις καὶ καθηγήσῃ βροτῶν.
258
τὸ δ’ εἰσθεᾶσθαι γῆν ὅλην τ’ οἰκουμένην,

καὶ τὰ ὑπένερθεν χὐπὲρ οὐρανὸν θεοῦ,
ὄψει τά τ’ ὄντα τά τε προτοῦ τά θ’ ὕστερον.
d

'Then his father-in-law thus interprets the dream:

"This sign from God bodes good to thee, my friend. 
Would I might live to see thy lot fulfilled! 
A mighty throne shalt thou set up, and be 
Thyself the leader and the judge of men! 
And as o'er all the peopled earth thine eye 
Looked forth, and underneath the earth, and high 
Above God's heaven; so shall thy mind survey 
All things in time, past, present, and to come."

7
περὶ δὲ τῆς καιομένης βάτου καὶ τῆς ἀποστολῆς αὐτοῦ τῆς πρὸς Φαραὼ πάλιν παρεισάγει δι’ ἀμοιβαίων τὸν Μωσῆν τῷ θεῷ διαλεγόμενον. φησὶ δὲ
ὁ Μώσης

ἔα ’ τί μοι σημεῖον ἐκ βάτου τόδε,

αὐτοῦ δὲ χλωρὸν πᾶν μένει τὸ βλαστάνον.

τί δή; προελθὼν ὄψομαι τεράστιον
μέγιστον • οὐ γὰρ πίστιν ἀνθρώποις φέρει.

'With regard to the burning bush, and the mission of Moses to Pharaoh, he again brings Moses forward as holding converse alternately with God. Moses speaks thus:

"Ha! see! What sign is this from yonder bush? 
A marvel such as no man might believe. 
A sudden mighty fire flames round the bush, 
And yet its growth remains all green and fresh. 
What then? I will go forward, and behold 
This wondrous sign, that passes man's belief."

8

'Then God speaks to him:

"Stay, Moses, faithful servant, draw not nigh, 
Ere thou hast loosed thy shoes from off thy feet: 
The place thou standest on is holy ground; 
And from this bush God's word shines forth for thee. 
Fear not, My son, but hearken to My words. 
Of mortal birth, thou canst not see My face; 
Yet mayest thou hear the words I came to speak.
Thy fathers' God, the God of Abraham,
Of Isaac, and of Jacob, I am God.
I do remember all My gifts to them,
And come to save My people Israel;
For I have seen their sorrows and their toils.
Go then, and signify thou in My name,
First to the Hebrews gathered by themselves,
Then to the king of Egypt, this My will,
That thou lead forth My people from the land."

9
εἶτα ὑποβάς τινα ἀμοιβαῖα αὐτὸς ὁ Μώσης λέγει

'Then lower down Moses himself speaks some lines in answer:

"I am not eloquent, O Lord, but slow  
Of speech my tongue, and weak my stammering voice  
To utter words of mine before the king?"

'Then God in answer to this says to him:

"Thy brother Aaron I will send with speed:  
First tell thou him all I have told to thee;  
And he before the king, and thou with  
Me Alone shalt speak, he what he hears from thee."

'With regard to the rod, and the other wonders thus he speaks in alternate verse:

"God. 'Say, what is that thou holdest in thine hand? '  
M. 'A rod, wherewith to smite or beasts or men.'  
God. 'Cast it upon the ground, and flee in haste; 
For a fierce serpent will affright thine eye.'  
N. 'Lo! there I cast it. Save me, gracious Lord!
How huge, how fierce! In pity spare Thou me.
I shudder at the sight in every limb.'  
God. 'Fear not: stretch forth thy hand, and seize the tail.
Again 'twill be a rod. Now thrust thy hand
Into thy bosom: take it out again.
See, at My word, 'tis leprous, white as snow.
Now thrust it in again, 'tis as before.' "

To this, after some words that he has interposed, he adds the following:

'Now this is what Ezekiel says in The Exodus, when he brings forward God speaking of the signs, as follows:

"With this thy rod thou shalt work all these plagues. 
The river first shall flow all red with blood,  
And every spring, and stream, and stagnant pool.  
Then frogs and lice shall swarm o'er all the land.  
Next ashes from the furnace sprinkled round 
In ulcers sore shall burst on man and beast.
And swarms of flies shall come, and sore afflict
The bodies of the Egyptians. After that
On those hard hearts the pestilence and death
Shall fall. And heaven's wrath let loose on high
Shall pour down fire and hail and deadly storm
On man, and beast, and all the fruits of earth.
Then shall be darkness over all the land
For three whole days, and locusts shall devour
All food, all fruits, and every blade of grass.
Moreover I will slay each first-born child,
And crush this evil nation's wanton pride.
Yet none of these My plagues shall touch the king,
Until he see his first-born son lie dead:
Then will he send you forth in fear and haste.
This also speak to all the Hebrew race:
'This month shall be the first month of your year,
Wherein I bring you to that other land,
As to the fathers of your race I sware.'
Also command the people, in this month,
At evening ere the moon's full orb appear,
To sacrifice the Passover to God,
And strike the side-posts of the door with blood:
So shall My messenger of death pass by.
But the flesh eat ye roast with fire at night.
Then will the king drive forth your gathered host
In haste; but ere ye go, I will give grace
To this My people in the Egyptians' eyes,
So that each woman from her neighbour's store
All needful vessels freely shall receive,
Silver and gold, and raiment meet for man,
To make requital for their evil deeds.
And when ye shall have reached your promised land,
Take heed that, from the morn whereon ye fled
From Egypt and marched onward seven whole days,
From that same morn so many days each year
Ye eat unleavened bread, and serve your God,
Offering the first-born of all living things,
All males that open first the mother's womb."

'And again concerning this same feast he says that the poet has spoken with more careful elaboration:

"And when the tenth day of this month is come,  
Let every Hebrew for his household choose  
Unblemished lambs and calves, and keep them up  
Until the fourteenth day; and then at eve  
Offer the solemn sacrifice, and eat  
The flesh and inward parts all roast with fire.  
Thus shall ye eat it, with your loins girt up,
And shoes upon your feet, a staff withal
Held ready in your hand; for in great haste
The king will bid them drive you from his land.
Let each man's eating for the lamb make count;
And when the victim has been duly slain,
Take a full bunch of hyssop in your hand,
Dipped in the sacred blood, and therewith strike
The posts and upper lintel of the door;
That death may pass o'er every Hebrew's house.
Keep ever thus this feast unto the Lord,
Eating for seven days unleavened bread,
And in your houses let no leaven be found.
For ye shall be delivered, and the Lord
Shall lead you forth from Egypt in this month,
Henceforth to be tho first month of your year."

Again, after some other passages he further says:

'Ezekiel also, in the drama which is entitled The Exodus, brings forward a Messenger describing both the condition of the Hebrews and the destruction of the Egyptians, as follows:

For when king Pharaoh from his house set forth  
With all this crowd of countless men-at-arms,  
With horsemen, and with four-horsed chariots,  
In serried ranks in front and on each flank,  
The embattled host was dreadful to behold.  
The centre footmen held in phalanx deep  
With spaces for the chariots to drive through.  
And on the right wing and the left were set 
The best of all the Egyptian chivalry.  
The numbers of our army which I asked,  
Were thousand thousands brave well-armed men.  
The Hebrews, when o'ertaken by our host,  
Lay some in groups hard by the Red Sea shore  
Worn out with toil, and others with their wives  
To feed their tender infants were intent:  
Cumbered with flocks and herds and household goods.  
The men themselves with hands not armed for fight,  
At sight of us, set up a doleful cry,  
And all, with hands uplift to heaven, invoked  
Their fathers' God. Great was their multitude;  
But on our side all jubilant our camp  
Behind them close we pitched, where by the sea  
There lies a city, Baal-zephon hight.  
And as the sun was near his western couch,  
We waited, longing for the fight at dawn,  
Trusting our mighty host and deadly arms.  
But now the signs of heaven's own wrath began,
A dread and wondrous sight. For suddenly  
A pillar of cloud rose high above the earth  
Midway between the Hebrew camp and ours:  
And then their leader Moses took his rod  
Of power divine, which late on Egypt wrought  
So many baneful signs and prodigies.  
Therewith he struck the waves, and the deep sea  
Was cleft asunder; and with eager steps  
Their host rushed swiftly o'er that briny path.  
We then upon their track without delay  
Trod the same path, and marching forward met  
The darkness of the night; when suddenly,  
As if fast bound in chains, our chariot wheels
Refused to turn; and from the sky a flame  
As of a mighty fire before us shone.  
Their God, methinks, was there to succour them:  
For they no sooner reached the farther shore,  
Than close at hand we heard the mighty roar  
Of surging waves; and one in terror cried:  
'Flee from the vengeful hand of the Most High,  
For it is He that helps our enemies,  
And works for our destruction.' Then the sea
Surged o'er our path, and overwhelmed our host.

And again soon after:

'Thence they went forward three days, as Demetrius himself says, and the Holy Scripture agrees with him: but as he found there no sweet water, but bitter, at God's command he cast the wood of a certain tree into the fountain, and the water became sweet. And thence they came to Elim, and found there twelve springs of water, and threescore and ten palm-trees. As to these, and the bird which appeared there, Ezekiel in The Exodus introduces some one who speaks to Moses concerning the palm-trees and the twelve springs thus:

''See, my lord Moses, what a spot is found  
Fanned by sweet airs from yonder shady grove.  
For as thyself mayest see, there lies the stream,  
And thence at night the fiery pillar shed  
Its welcome guiding light. A meadow there  
Beside the stream in grateful shadow lies  
And a deep glen in rich abundance pours  
From out a single rock twelve sparkling springs.  
There tall and strong, and laden all with fruit,  
Stand palms threescore and ten; and plenteous grass  
Well watered gives sweet pasture to our flocks."

'Then lower down he gives a full description of the bird that appeared:

"Another living thing we saw, more strange  
And marvellous than man e'er saw before.  
The noblest eagle scarce was half as large:  
His outspread wings with varying colours shone;  
The breast was bright with purple, and the legs  
With crimson glowed, and on the shapely neck  
The golden plumage shone in graceful curves:  
The head was like a gentle nestling's formed:  
Bright shone the yellow circlet of the eye  
On all around, and wondrous sweet the voice.  
The king he seemed of all the winged tribe,  
As soon was proved; for birds of every kind  
Hovered in fear behind his stately form:  
While like a bull, proud leader of the herd,  
Foremost he marched with swift and haughty step."

And after a few words he adds that:

'Some one asked how the Israelites got weapons, as they came out unarmed. For they said that after they had gone out a three days' journey, and offered sacrifice, they would return again. It appears therefore that these who had not been overwhelmed in the sea made use of the others' arms.'

'Now Aristoxenus the Musician says that this argument comes from the Indians: 

Αθήνησι γὰρ ἐντυχεῖν Σωκράτει τῶν ἀνδρῶν ἐκείνων ἕνα τινὰ, κἄπειτα αὐτοῦ πυνθάνεσθαι τί ποιῶν φιλοσοφοίη· 

for a certain man of that nation fell in with Socrates at Athens, and presently asked him, what he was doing in philosophy: 

τοῦ δὲ εἰπόντος ὅτι ζητῶν περὶ τοῦ ἀνθρωπίνου βίου , καταγελάσαι τὸν Ἰνδὸν , λέγοντα μὴ δύνασθαί τινα τὰ ἀνθρώπινα καταδεῖν, ἀγνοοῦντά γε τὰ θεῖα.

and when he said, that he was studying human life, the Indian laughed at him, and said that no one could comprehend things human, if he were ignorant of things divine.

τῶνδε τῶν λόγων τὴν διάνοιαν ἐκφαίνουσι. πλείους μὲν οὖν εἰς τὴν τούτων ἐπιβεβλήκασι θεωρίαν, ἐμοὶ δ’ ἐξαρκεῖ τανῦν ἀνδρὸς ἐπιφανοῦς Νουμηνίου τοῦ Πυθαγορείου παραθέσθαι λέξεις, ἃς ἐν
τῷ Περὶ τἀγαθοῦ δευτέρῳ συγγράμματι ὧδέ πη διέξεισιν

MOSES in his declarations of sacred truth uttered a response in the person of God: 'I AM THAT I AM. Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you,' 35 and so represented God as the sole absolute Being, and declared Him to have been properly and fitly honoured with this name.

And Solomon again spake concerning the origin and the decay of things corporeal and sensible: 'What is that which hath been? The very thing that shall be. And what is that which hath been done? The very thing that shall be done. And there is nothing new under the sun, whereof a man shall speak and say, See, this is new. It hath been already, in the ages which were before us.' 36

In accordance with them we also divide the All into two parts, that which can be perceived only by the mind, and that which can be perceived by the senses: and the former we define as incorporeal and rational in its nature, and imperishable and immortal; but the sensible as being always in flux and decay, and in change and conversion of its substance. And all things being summed up and referred to one beginning, we hold the doctrine that the uncreate, and that which has proper and true being, is One, which is the cause of all things incorporeal and corporeal.

Now see in what manner Plato, having imitated not only the thought, but also the very expressions and words of the Hebrew Scripture, appropriates the doctrine, explaining it more at large, as follows:

'What is that which always is and has no becoming? And what is that which is always becoming and never is? The former is that which may be comprehended by intelligence combined with reason, being always in the same conditions. The latter is that which may be conjectured by opinion with the help of unreasoning sensation, becoming and perishing but never really being.' 37

Does it not plainly appear that the admirable philosopher has altered the oracle which in Moses declared 'I AM THAT I AM' 38 into 'What is that which always is and has no becoming?' And this he has made still clearer when he says that true 'being' is nothing else than that which is not seen by eyes of flesh, but is conceived by the mind. So having asked, What is 'being'? he makes answer to himself, saying: 'That which may be comprehended by intelligence combined with reason.' 

And as to Solomon's maxim which said, 'What is that which hath been? The very thing that shall be. And what is that which hath been done? The very thing that shall be done,' 39 it must be evident that he translated this almost in the very words, saying, 'But that which may be conjectured by means of irrational sensation is becoming and perishing, but never really "being."' To which he also adds: 40

'For all these are parts of time, the "was" and "shall be"; which we unconsciously but wrongly transfer to the eternal essence. For we say that "It was, and is, and shall be." But to this essence the "is" alone is truly appropriate; and the "was" and the "will be" are proper to be spoken of the generation in time, for they are movements. But to that which is always immovably in the same conditions it belongs not to become either older or younger through time: nor that it ever became, nor has now become, nor will be hereafter at all, nor be subject to any of the conditions which becoming attaches to the things which pass to and fro in sensation: but these are forms of time, imitating eternity and moving by number in a circle. And besides these there are such expressions as the following; what has become is become, and what becomes is becoming, and what will become is about to become.'

And lest any one should suppose that I am misinterpreting the philosopher's words, I will make use of commentaries which explain the meaning of these statements. There are indeed many who have set themselves to the consideration of these matters; but at present it is enough for me to quote the expressions of an illustrious man, Numenius the Pythagorean, which he uses in his second Book Concerning the Good, as follows:

[NUMENIUS] 41 'COME then, let us mount up as nearly as we possibly can to true "being," and let us say that "being" neither at any time "was," nor ever can "become," but always "is" in a definite time, the present only.

'If, however, any one wishes to rename this present time eternity, I too am willing. But the time past we ought to consider altogether gone, already so gone away and escaped as to exist no longer: and on the other hand the time to come as yet is not, but professes to be able at some future time to come into being.

'It is not therefore reasonable to suppose "being," at least in one and the same sense, either not to be or to be no longer, or not yet. Since when this is so stated, there arises in the statement one great impossibility, that the same thing at the same time should both be and not be.

'For if this were so, scarcely would it be possible for anything else to be, if "being" itself in regard to its very "being" be not. For "being" is eternal and constant, ever in the same condition, nor has it been generated and destroyed, nor increased and diminished: nor did it ever yet become more or less: and certainly neither in other senses nor yet locally will it be moved.

'For it is not right for it to be moved, either backward or forward: nor upward ever, nor downward: neither to the right hand nor to the left shall "being" ever pass: nor shall it ever be moved around its own centre; but rather it shall stand fast, and shall be fixed and set firm, ever in the same conditions and same mode.'

And then, after other statements, he adds:

'So much then for my introduction. But for my own part I will no longer make pretences, nor say that I do not know the name of the incorporeal; for now at length it seems likely to be pleasanter to speak than not to speak it. And so then I say that its name is that which we have so long been examining.

'But let no one laugh, if I affirm that the name of the incorporeal is "essence" and "being." And the cause of the name "being" is that it has not been generated nor will be destroyed, nor is it subject to any other motion at all, nor any change for better or for worse; but is simple and unchangeable, and in the same idea, and neither willingly departs from its sameness, nor is compelled by any other to depart.

'Plato too said in the Cratylus 42 that names are exactly adapted to a likeness of the things. Be it granted then and agreed that "being" is the incorporeal.'

Then lower down he adds:

'I said that "being" is incorporeal, and that this is that which can be perceived by the mind only. Their statements then, so far as I can remember, were certainly of this kind: but any one who feels the want of an explanation I am willing to encourage with just this suggestion, that if these statements do not agree with the doctrines of Plato, yet at least he must consider them to be those of some other great man of the highest ability, such as Pythagoras.

'Plato at all events says 43 ----come, let me remember how he says it----What is that which, always is and has no becoming? And what that which is always becoming, and never is? The first that which may be comprehended by intelligence combined with reason, and the other that which may be conjectured by opinion with the aid of unreasoning sensation, becoming and perishing, but never really "being."

'For he was inquiring what is "being," and saying that it is unquestionably without beginning. For he said that for "being" there is no becoming: for then it would be changed, but that which is liable to change is not eternal.'

Then below he says:

'If then "being" is altogether and in every way eternal and unchangeable, and by no means departs in any way from itself, but abides in the same conditions, and remains fixed in the same manner, this surely must be that which can be comprehended by intelligence combined with reason.

'But if body is in flux and is carried off by the change of the moment, it passes away and no longer exists. Wherefore is it not utter folly to deny that this is something undefinable, and that can only be conjectured by opinion, and, as Plato says, becoming and perishing, but never really "being"? '

Thus then speaks Numenius, explaining clearly both Plato's doctrines and the much earlier doctrines of Moses. With reason therefore is that saying currently attributed to him, in which it is recorded that he said, 'For what else is Plato than Moses speaking Attic Greek?'

But see, besides this, whether Plutarch in further unfolding the same thought may not agree both with the statements of philosophers which have been brought forward, and the theological doctrines of the Hebrews set forth again in other places, whereby at one time the God who makes answer is introduced as saying: 44 'For I am the LORD your God, and I am not changed': and at another time the Prophet directs his speech with a view to Him, saying that the things which are seen would all some time be changed and removed, 'but Thou art the same, and Thy years shall not fail.' 45 Observe then whether----when He who spake in Moses, as if proposing a question, said,'I AM THAT I AM,' and, 'I am the LORD your God, and I am not changed': and again, 'But Thou art (εἶ) the same'----whether, I say. Plutarch would not seem to be interpreting the meaning of this in his treatise Concerning the Εἶ at Delphi, when he speaks word for word thus: 46

[PLOTINUS] 83 'IF any one admires this world of sense, beholding at once its greatness and beauty and the order of its eternal course, and the gods that are therein, some visible, and some invisible, the daemons, and animals and all kinds of plants, let him mount up to its original pattern and to the more real world, and there let him see all intelligible things, and things which are of themselves eternal in their own understanding and life, see also the pure intelligence and the infinite wisdom that presides over them.' 

Then afterwards in addition to this he says: 

'Who then is He that begat Him? He who is simple, and prior to a plurality of this kind, who is the cause both of His being, and of His plurality. For number came not first: since before the duad is the one; and the duad is second, and produced from the one.' 84

And again he goes on and adds: 85

'How then and what must we conceive concerning that abiding substance? A light shining around and proceeding from it, while it remains itself unchanged, as from the sun proceeds the bright surrounding light that runs around it, ever produced out of it, while it remains unchanged itself.

'And all existing things, so long as they remain, give forth necessarily from their own essence and from the power present in the substance which surrounds them externally and is dependent upon them, being as it were an image of the archetypes from which it sprang.

'Thus fire gives forth the heat which proceeds from it, and snow does not merely retain its cold within itself. And especially all fragrant things bear witness to this fact: for as long as they exist, a something from them goes forth around them, which is enjoyed by whatever is near.

'Moreover all things as soon as they are perfect begin to generate: so that which is always perfect is always generating a something eternal, and what it generates is less than itself.

'What then must we say concerning the Most Perfect? That He either generates nothing from Himself, or the things which are the greatest next to Himself. But after Him mind is the greatest and the second. For the mind beholds Him and has need of Him alone, but He has no need of it: and that which is begotten from a superior mind, must be mind; and mind is superior to all things, because all the rest come after it.'

After this he says further: 86

'Now everything desires and loves that which begat it, and especially when that which begat and that which is begotten exist alone. And when that which begat is also the very best, the begotten is necessarily so joined with it, as to be separated only by its otherness. But, since it is necessary to speak more plainly, I mean that mind is His image.'

And to this again he adds: 87

'This is the reason also of Plato's trinities: for he says that around the King of all are all the primaries, and around the second the secondaries, and around the third the tertiaries. He says also that the Cause has a Father, meaning that Mind is the Cause, for with Plato Mind is the Creator.

'And Mind, he says, makes the Soul in that cup of his. And the Cause which is Mind has for its Father, he says, the Good, and that which transcends both Mind and essence. But in many places he speaks of Being and of Mind as the Idea. So that Plato recognizes Mind as proceeding from the Good, and the Soul from Mind: and these are no new doctrines, nor now first stated, but long since, though not publicly divulged: and the doctrines of the present time have been interpretations of the former, which by the testimony of Plato's own writings have confirmed the antiquity of these opinions.'

This is what Plotinus says. And Numenius highly commending Plato's doctrines in his treatise Of the Good gives his own interpretation of the Second Cause, as follows:

not deprive the former, but had its own material kindled at the other's flame.

'Such a thing is knowledge, which when given and received remains the same with the giver, and is communicated to the receiver.

'And the cause of this, my friend, is not anything human; but that the state and essence which possesses knowledge is the same both in God who has given, and in you and me who have received it.

'Wherefore also Plato said that wisdom was brought to mankind "with a brilliant flame of fire by Prometheus."' 94

And again afterwards lower down he says: 

'Now the modes of life of the First God and of the Second are these: evidently the First God will be at rest, while the Second on the contrary is in motion. So then the First is engaged with intelligibles, and the Second with both intelligibles and sensibles. 'And be not surprised at my saying this, for you are going to hear something far more surprising. For instead of that motion which belongs to the Second I assert that the rest which belongs to the First is His natural motion, from which both the order of the world, and its eternal continuance, and its safety is diffused throughout the universe.' 95

After this in the sixth Book also he adds the following: 96

'Since Plato knew that the Creator alone was known among men, but that the First Mind, which is called Absolute Being, is altogether unknown among them, therefore he spoke in this way, just as if one were to say; The First Mind, my good sirs, is not that which you imagine, but another mind before it, more ancient and more divine.'

And after other passages he adds:

'A pilot when driven along in mid ocean, sits high above the helm, and steers the ship by the tillers, but his eyes and mind are strained directly at the sky, looking at things aloft, as his course passes across the heaven above, while he sails upon the sea below. So also the Creator having bound matter together in harmony that it may neither break out nor slip away, is Himself seated above matter, as above a ship on the sea: and in directing the harmony He steers by the ideas, while instead of the sky He looks to the High God who attracts His eyes, and takes His judgement from that contemplation, and His energy from that impulse.'

Also the Word of our Salvation says, 'The Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He seeth the Father doing.' 97 Enough, however, has been said by Numenius on this subject: and there is no need to add anything to his own words to show that he was explaining not his own opinions but Plato's. And that Plato is not the first who has made these attempts, but has been anticipated by the Hebrew sages, has been proved by the examples already set forth. Naturally therefore Amelius also, who was distinguished among recent philosophers, and above all others an admirer of Plato's philosophy, who moreover called the Hebrew theologian a Barbarian, even though he did not deign to mention John the Evangelist by name, nevertheless bears witness to his statements, writing exactly what follows word for word:

III. The Redaction of Aristóvoulos (Ἀριστόβουλος)

(6) Aristóvoulos in Εὑαγγελικὴ προπαρασκευὴ Εὐσεβίου XIII 12 (II 191, 11 Dind.), which is followed by the recension in the Tübingen Theosophy [T], from which the verse is on p. 263s.:

δεῖ γὰρ λαμβάνειν τὴν θείαν φωνὴν οὐ ῥητὸν λόγον, ἀλλ’ ἔργων κατασκευάς, καθὼς καὶ διὰ τῆς νομοθεσίας ἡμῖν ὅλην τὴν γένεσιν τοῦ κόσμου θεοῦ λόγους εἴρηκεν ὁ Μώσης. συνεχῶς γάρ φησιν ἐφ' ἑκάστου 'καὶ εἶπεν ὁ θεὸς, καὶ ἐγένετο’.

“For we must understand the voice of God not as words spoken, but as construction of works, just as Moses in the Law has spoken of the whole creation of the world as words of God. For he constantly says of each work, ‘And God said, and it was so.’

δο κοῦσι δέ μοι περιειργασμένοι πάντα κατηκολουθηκέναι τούτωι Πυθαγόρας τε καὶ Σωκράτης καὶ Πλάτων, λέγοντες ἀκούειν φωνῆς θεοῦ, τὴν κατασκευὴν τῶν ὅλων συνθεωροῦντες ἀκριβῶς ὑπὸ θεοῦ γεγονυῖαν καὶ συνεχομένην ἀδιαλείπτως. ἔτι δὲ καὶ Ὀρφεὺς ἐν ποιήμασι τῶν κατὰ τὸν ἱερὸν λόγον αὐτῶι λεγομένων οὕτως ἐκτίθεται περὶ τοῦ διακρατεῖσθαι θείαι δυνάμει τὰ πάντα καὶ γενητὰ ὑπάρχειν, καὶ ἐπὶ πάντων εἶναι τὸν θεόν. λέγει δ’ οὕτως·

“Now it seems to me that he has been very carefully followed in all by Pythagoras, and Socrates, and Plato, who said that they heard the voice of God, when they were contemplating the arrangement of the universe so accurately made and indissolubly combined by God. Moreover, Orpheus, in verses taken from his writings in the Sacred Legend, thus sets forth the doctrine that all things are governed by divine power, and that they have had a beginning, and that God is over all. And this is what he says:

αὐτὸν δ᾿ οὐχ ὁρόω· περὶ γὰρ νέφος ἐστήρικται   20

λοιπὸν ἐμοί καὶ πᾶσι δεκάπτυχον ἀνθρώποισιν·

οὐ γάρ κέν τις ἴδοι θνητῶν μερόπων κρείνοντα,

εἰ μὴ μουνογενής τις ἀπορρὼξ φύλου ἄνωθεν

Χαλδαίων· ἴδρις γὰρ ἔην ἄστροιο πορείης,

καὶ σφαίρης ἥτ' ἀμφὶς ὀχῆος ἀεὶ περιτέλλει,   25

κυκλοτερὴς ἴση τε κατὰ σφέτερον κνώδακα.

πνεύματα δ᾿ ἡνιοχεῖ περί τ᾿ ἠέρα καὶ περὶ χεῦμα

νάματος· ἐκφαίνει δὲ πυρὸς σέλας ἰφιγενήτου.

αὐτὸς δὴ μέγαν αὖθις ἐπ᾿ οὐρανὸν ἐστήρικται

χρυσέωι εἰνὶ θρόνωι· γαίη δ᾿ ὑπὸ ποσσὶ βέβηκε·   30

χεῖρα δὲ δεξιτερὴν ἐπὶ τέρμασιν Ὠκεανοῖο

ἐκτέτακεν· ὀρέων δὲ τρέμει βάσις ἔνδοθι θυμῶι,

οὐδὲ φέρειν δύναται κρατερὸν μένος. ἔστι δὲ πάντηι

αὐτὸς ἐπουράνιος, καὶ ἐπὶ χθονὶ πάντα τελευτῆι,

ἀρχὴν αὐτὸς ἔχων καὶ μέσσην ἠδὲ τελευτὴν,   35

ὡς λόγος ἀρχαίων, ὡς ὑλογενὴς διέταξεν,

ἐκ θεόθεν γνώμαισι λαβὼν κατὰ δίπλακα θεσμόν.

ἄλλως οὐ θεμιτὸν δὲ λέγειν· τρομέω δέ τε λίην

ἐν νόωι. ἐξ ὑπάτου κραίνει περὶ πάντ' ἐνὶ τάξει.

ὦ τέκνον, σὺ δὲ τοῖσι νόοισι πελάζεο, γλώσσης

εὖ μάλ᾿ ἐπικρατέων, στέρνοισι δὲ ἔνθεο φήμην.

‘I speak to those who lawfully may hear: 

Depart, and close the doors, all ye profane, 

Who hate the ordinances of the just, 

The law divine announced to all mankind. 

But thou, Musaeus, child of the bright Moon, 

Lend me thine ear; for I have truths to tell. 

Let not the former fancies of thy mind 

Amerce thee of the dear and blessed life. 

Look to the word divine, keep close to that, 

And guide thereby the deep thoughts of thine heart. 

Walk wisely in the way, and look to none, 

Save to the immortal Framer of the world: 

For thus of Him an ancient story speaks: 

One, perfect in Himself, all else by Him 

Made perfect: ever present in His works, 

By mortal eyes unseen, by mind alone 

Discerned. It is not He that out of good 

Makes evil to spring up for mortal men. 

Both love and hatred wait upon His steps, 

And war and pestilence, and sorrow and tears: 

For there is none but He. All other things 

'Twere easy to behold, could'st thou but first 

Behold Himself here present upon earth. 

The footsteps and the mighty hand of God 

Whene'er I see, I'll show them thee, my son: 

But Him I cannot see, so dense a cloud 

In tenfold darkness wraps our feeble sight. 

Him in His power no mortal could behold, 

Save one, a scion of Chaldaean race: 

For he was skilled to mark the sun's bright path, 

And how in even circle round the earth

The starry sphere on its own axis turns, 

And winds their chariot guide o'er sea and sky; 

And showed where fire's bright flame its strength displayed. 

But God Himself, high above heaven unmoved, 

Sits on His golden throne, and plants His feet 

On the broad earth; His right hand He extends 

O'er Ocean's farthest bound; the eternal hills 


Tremble in their deep heart, nor can endure 

His mighty power. And still above the heavens

Alone He sits, and governs all on earth, 

Himself first cause, and means, and end of all. 

So men of old, so tells the Nile-born sage, 

Taught by the twofold tablet of God's law; 

Nor otherwise dare I of Him to speak: 

In heart and limbs I tremble at the thought, 

How He from heaven all things in order rules. 

Draw near in thought, my son; but guard thy tongue 

With care, and store this doctrine in thine heart.’ ”

(trans. E. H. Gifford, 1903)
