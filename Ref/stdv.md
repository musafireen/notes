#### 100
**अयुक्तमपि चेदेतदहंकारात्प्रवर्तते**  
**तदयुक्तं निवर्त्यं तत्स्वमन्यच्च यथाबलम्**  
“True, it’s inadmissible,” you’ll say,
“It happens simply through the force of ego-clinging.”
But what is inadmissible for others and myself
Should be discarded utterly!
#### 101
**संतानः समुदायश्च पङ्क्तिसेनादिवन्मृषा**  
**यस्य दुःखं स नास्त्यस्मात्कस्य तत्स्वं भविष्यति**  
Continua and gatherings, so-called,
Like garlands and like armies, are unreal.
So there is no one to experience pain
For who is there to be its “owner”?
#### 102
**अस्वामिकानि दुःखानि सर्वाण्येवाविशेषतः**  
**दुःखत्वादेव वार्याणि नियमस्तत्र किंकृतः**  
Suffering has no “possessor,”
Therefore no distinctions can be made in it.
Since pain is pain, it is to be dispelled.
What use is there in drawing boundaries?
#### 103
**दुःखं कस्मान्निवार्यं चेत्सर्वेषामविवादतः**  
“But why dispel the pains of all?”
You cannot argue in this way!

**वार्यं चेत्सर्वमप्येवं न चेदात्मापि सत्त्ववत्**  

If “my” pain is removed, so too should that of “others.”
If theirs is not, then neither should be mine.
#### 104
**कृपया बहु दुःखं चेत्कस्मादुत्पद्यते बलात्**  
**जगद्दुःखं निरूप्येदं कृपादुःखं कथं बहु**  
“Compassion makes us feel such pain,” you say,
“So why should we make efforts to engender it?”
But thinking of the sufferings of beings,
How can you regard as great the smart of your compassion?
#### 105
**बहूनामेकदुःखेन यदि दुःखं विगच्छति**  
**उत्पाद्यमेव तद्दुःखं सदयेन परात्मनोः**  
And if through such a single pain
A multitude of sorrows can be cured,
Such pain as this all loving people
Strive to foster in themselves and others.
#### 106
**अतः सुपुष्पचन्द्रेण जानतापि नृपापदम्**  
**आत्मदुःखं न निहतं बहूनां दुःखिनां व्ययात्**  
Thus Supuṣhpachandra,99
Knowing that the king would cause him harm,
Did nothing to escape from tribulation,
That the pains of many should be ended.
#### 107
**एवं भावितसंतानाः परदुःखसमप्रियाः**  
**अवीचिमवगाहन्ते हंसाः पद्मवनं यथा**  
Those whose minds are practiced in this way,
Whose joy it is to soothe another’s ills,
Will venture into hell of Unrelenting Pain
As swans sweep down upon a lotus lake.
#### 108
**मुच्यमानेषु सत्त्वेषु ये ते प्रामोद्यसागराः**  
**तैरेव ननु पर्याप्तं मोक्षेणारसिकेन किम्**  
The ocean-like immensity of joy
Arising when all beings will be freed,
Will this not be enough? Will this not satisfy?
The wish for my own freedom, what is that to me?
#### 109
**अतः परार्थं कृत्वापि न मदो न च विस्मयः**  
**न विपाकफलाकाङ्क्षा परार्थैकान्ततृष्णया**  
The work of bringing benefit to beings
Will not, then, make me proud and self-admiring.
The happiness of others is itself my satisfaction;
I do not expect another recompense.
#### 110
**तस्माद्यथान्तशोऽवर्णादात्मानं गोपयाम्यहम्**  
**रक्षाचित्तं दयाचित्तं करोम्येवं परेष्वपि**  
Therefore just as I defend myself
From even slight disparagement,
In just the same way with regard to others,
I should likewise have a mind protective and compassionate.
#### 111
**अभ्यासादन्यदीयेषु शुक्रशोणितबिन्दुषु**  
**भवत्यहमिति ज्ञानमसत्यपि हि वस्तुनि**  
The drop of sperm and blood100 belonged to others.
Yet, through strong habituation,
I came to have in its regard a sense of “I,”
Though, in itself, it is devoid of entity.
#### 112
**तथा कायोऽन्यदीयोऽपि किमात्मेति न गृह्यते**  
**परत्वं तु स्वकायस्य स्थितमेव न दुष्करम्**  
And so, why not identify
Another’s body, calling it my “I”?
And vice versa, why should it be hard
To think of this my body as another’s?
#### 113
**ज्ञात्वा सदोषमात्मानं परानपि गुणोदधीन्**  
**आत्मभावपरित्यागं परादानं च भावयेत्**  
Perceiving now the faults possessed by “I,”
The ocean of good qualities that are in “other,”
I shall lay aside all love of self
And gain the habit of adopting other beings.
#### 114
**कायस्यावयवत्वेन यथाभीष्टाः करादयः**  
**जगतोऽवयवत्वेन तथा कस्मान्न देहिनः**  
Just as hands and other limbs
Are thought of as the members of a body,
Can we likewise not consider others
As the limbs and members of a living whole?
#### 115
**यथात्मबुद्धिरभ्यासात्स्वकायेऽस्मिन्निरात्मके**  
**परेष्वपि तथात्मत्वं किमभ्यासान्न जायते**  
Just as in connection with this form, devoid of self,
My sense of “I” arose through strong habituation,
Why should not the thought of “I,”
Through habit, not arise related to another?
#### 116
**एवं परार्थं कृत्वापि न मदो न च विस्मयः**  
**आत्मानं भोजयित्वैव फलाशा न च जायते**  
Thus when I work for others’ sake,
There’ll be no sense of boasting self-congratulation.
It is just as when I feed myself—
I don’t expect to be rewarded!
#### 117
**तस्माद्यथार्तिशोकादेरात्मानं गोप्तुमिच्छसि**  
**रक्षाचित्तं दयाचित्तं जगत्यभ्यस्यतां तथा**  
Therefore just as I defend myself
From even slight disparagement,
Likewise for beings I shall now grow used
To have a mind protective and compassionate.
#### 118
**अध्यतिष्ठदतो नाथः स्वनामाप्यवलोकितः**  
**पर्षच्छारद्यभयमप्यपनेतुं जनस्य हि**  
This is why the Lord Avalokita
Out of great compassion blessed his name,
That those caught in the midst of multitudes
Might be released and freed from every fear.101
#### 119
**दुष्करान्न निवर्तेत यस्मादभ्यासशक्तितः**  
**यस्यैव श्रवणात्रासस्तेनैव न विना रतिः**  
And so we should be undeterred by hardships,
For through the influence of use and habit,
People even come to grieve
For those whose very names struck terror in their hearts!
#### 120
**आत्मानं चापरांश्चैव यः शीघ्रं त्रातुमिच्छति**  
**स चरेत्परमं गुह्यं परात्मपरिवर्तनम्**  
Those desiring speedily to be
A refuge for themselves and others
Should make the interchange of “I” and “other,”
And thus embrace a sacred mystery.
### 121
**यस्मिन्नात्मन्यतिस्नेहादल्पादपि भयाद्भयम्**  
**न द्विषेत्कस्तमात्मानं शत्रुवधो भयावहः**  
Because of our attachment to our bodies,
Even little things alarm us.
This body, then, this source of so much terror—
Who would not detest it as the worst of foes?
#### 122
**यो मान्द्यक्षुत्पिपासादिप्रतीकारचिकीर्षया**  
**पक्षिमत्स्यमृगान् हन्ति परिपन्थं च तिष्ठति**  
Wishing to relieve our bodies’ ills,
Our hungry mouths, the dryness of our throats,
We steal the lives of fishes, birds, and deer
And lie in wait along the road.
#### 123
**यो लाभसत्क्रियाहेतोः पितरावपि मारयेत्**  
**रत्नत्रयस्वमादद्याद्येनावीचीन्धनो भवेत्**  
And for the sake of profit and position
Some there are who even kill their parents,
Or steal what has been offered to the Triple Gem,
Because of which, they’ll burn in hell of Unrelenting Pain.
#### 124
**कः पण्डितस्तमात्मानमिच्छेद्रक्षेत्प्रपूजयेत्**  
**न पश्येच्छत्रुवच्चैनं कश्चैनं प्रतिमानयेत्**  
Where are the wise and prudent then
Who cherish, guard, and serve the body?
Who would not perceive it as their foe,
And as their foe, regard it with contempt?
#### 125
**यदि दास्यामि किं भोक्ष्ये इत्यात्मार्थे पिशाचता**  
**यदि भोक्ष्ये किं ददामीति परार्थे देवराजता**  
“If I give this, what will be left for me?”
Thinking of oneself—the way of evil ghosts.
“If I keep this, what will be left to give?”
Concern for others is the way of heaven.102
#### 126
**आत्मार्थं पीडयित्वान्यं नरकादिषु पच्यते**  
**आत्मानं पीडयित्वा तु परार्थं सर्वसंपदः**  
If to serve myself I harm another,
I’ll suffer later in the realms of hell.
But if for others’ sake I harm myself,
Then every excellence will be my heritage.
#### 127
**दुर्गतिर्नीचता मौर्ख्यं ययैवात्मोन्नतीच्छया**  
**तामेवान्यत्र संक्राम्य सुगतिः सत्कृतिर्मतिः**  
Wanting what is best for me—
Stupidity, inferiority, and lower realms result!
Let this be changed, applied to others—
Honors and the realms of bliss will come!
#### 128
**आत्मार्थं परमाज्ञप्य दासत्वाद्यनुभूयते**  
**परार्थं त्वेनमाज्ञप्य स्वामित्वाद्यनुभूयते**  
Enslaving others, forcing them to serve me,
I will come to know the state of servitude.
But if I labor for the good of others,
Mastery and leadership will come to me.
#### 129
**ये केचिद्दुःखिता लोके सर्वे ते स्वसुखेच्छया**  
**ये केचित्सुखिता लोके सर्वे तेऽन्यसुखेच्छया**  
All the joy the world contains
Has come through wishing happiness for others.
All the misery the world contains
Has come through wanting pleasure for oneself.
#### 130
**बहुना वा किमुक्तेन दृश्यतामिदमन्तरम्**  
**स्वार्थार्थिनश्च बालस्य मुनेश्चान्यार्थकारिणः**  
Is there need for lengthy explanation?
Childish beings look out for themselves;
Buddhas labor for the good of others:
See the difference that divides them!
