## 191a
τὸ ἕτερον ὑπάρχειν τὸ εἶναι αὐτοῖς, ἀλλὰ τρεῖς· 

ἕτερον γὰρ τὸ ἀνθρώπῳ καὶ τὸ ἀμούσῳ εἶναι, καὶ τὸ ἀσχηματίστῳ καὶ χαλκῷ.
### 3
πόσαι μὲν οὖν αἱ ἀρχαὶ τῶν περὶ γένεσιν φυσικῶν, καὶ πῶς ποσαί, εἴρηται· 

So then, it has been stated how many and in what way the principles of natural generation exist.  

καὶ δῆλόν ἐστιν ὅτι δεῖ ὑποκεῖσθαί τι τοῖς ἐναντίοις καὶ τἀναντία δύο εἶναι. 

And it is clear that something must underlie the contraries, and that the contraries must be two.  

τρόπον δέ τινα ἄλλον οὐκ ἀναγκαῖον· 

But in another way, this is not necessary, 

ἱκανὸν γὰρ ἔσται τὸ ἕτερον τῶν ἐναντίων ποιεῖν τῇ ἀπουσίᾳ καὶ παρουσίᾳ τὴν μεταβολήν. 

for it will be sufficient that one of the contraries causes change through its presence and absence.  

ἡ δὲ ὑποκειμένη φύσις ἐπιστητὴ κατ' ἀναλογίαν. 

The underlying nature is knowable by analogy.  

ὡς γὰρ πρὸς ἀνδριάντα χαλκὸς ἢ πρὸς κλίνην ξύλον ἢ πρὸς τῶν ἄλλων τι τῶν ἐχόντων μορφὴν [ἡ ὕλη καὶ] τὸ ἄμορφον ἔχει πρὶν λαβεῖν τὴν μορφήν, οὕτως αὕτη πρὸς οὐσίαν ἔχει καὶ τὸ τόδε τι καὶ τὸ ὄν. 

Just as bronze in relation to a statue, or wood in relation to a bed, or any other material in relation to a shaped object,  
first exists without form before taking on form, so too does this (matter) relate to substance, to individual things, and to being.  

μία μὲν οὖν ἀρχὴ αὕτη, οὐχ οὕτω μία οὖσα οὐδὲ οὕτως ὂν ὡς τὸ τόδε τι, μία δὲ ἧς ὁ λόγος, ἔτι δὲ τὸ ἐναντίον τούτῳ, ἡ στέρησις. 

Thus, there is one principle—though not one in the same way as an individual thing—  
and another principle which is defined by reason, and yet another, its opposite: privation.  

ταῦτα δὲ πῶς δύο καὶ πῶς πλείω, εἴρηται ἐν τοῖς ἄνω. 

How these are two and yet more than two has been explained earlier.  

πρῶτον μὲν οὖν ἐλέχθη ὅτι ἀρχαὶ τἀναντία μόνον, ὕστερον δ' ὅτι ἀνάγκη καὶ ἄλλο τι
ὑποκεῖσθαι καὶ εἶναι τρία· 

At first, it was stated that the principles are only contraries. Later, it was said that there must also be something underlying them,  
so that in total there are three principles.  

ἐκ δὲ τῶν νῦν φανερὸν τίς ἡ διαφορὰ τῶν ἐναντίων, καὶ πῶς ἔχουσιν αἱ ἀρχαὶ πρὸς ἀλλήλας, καὶ τί τὸ ὑποκείμενον. 

From what has now been stated, it is clear what the difference between the contraries is, how the principles relate to each other, and what the underlying subject is.  

πότερον δὲ οὐσία τὸ εἶδος ἢ τὸ ὑποκείμενον, οὔπω δῆλον. 

However, whether the form or the underlying subject is substance is not yet clear.  

ἀλλ' ὅτι αἱ ἀρχαὶ τρεῖς καὶ πῶς τρεῖς, καὶ τίς ὁ τρόπος αὐτῶν, δῆλον. 

But that the principles are three, in what way they are three, and their nature—this is evident.  

πόσαι μὲν οὖν καὶ τίνες εἰσὶν αἱ ἀρχαί, ἐκ τούτων θεωρείσθωσαν.

From this, then, let it be considered how many and what the principles are.  

Ὅτι δὲ μοναχῶς οὕτω λύεται καὶ ἡ τῶν ἀρχαίων
ἀπορία, λέγωμεν μετὰ ταῦτα. 

That this also resolves the ancient difficulty in a unique way, let us now state.  

ζητοῦντες γὰρ οἱ κατὰ φιλοσοφίαν πρῶτοι τὴν ἀλήθειαν καὶ τὴν φύσιν τῶν ὄντων ἐξετράπησαν οἷον ὁδόν τινα ἄλλην ἀπωσθέντες ὑπὸ ἀπειρίας, 

For the first philosophers, in seeking truth and the nature of beings, were diverted from the correct path by inexperience and claimed that nothing comes into being nor perishes,  
### 27
καί φασιν οὔτε γίγνεσθαι τῶν ὄντων οὐδὲν οὔτε φθείρεσθαι διὰ τὸ ἀναγκαῖον μὲν εἶναι γίγνεσθαι τὸ γιγνόμενον ἢ ἐξ ὄντος ἢ ἐκ μὴ ὄντος, ἐκ δὲ τούτων ἀμφοτέρων ἀδύνατον εἶναι· 

because what comes into being must necessarily do so either from being or from non-being,  
and both of these are impossible.  

οὔτε γὰρ τὸ ὂν γίγνεσθαι (εἶναι γὰρ ἤδη) ἔκ τε μὴ ὄντος οὐδὲν ἂν γενέσθαι· 

For being cannot come into being (since it already is),  
and from non-being, nothing can be generated,  

ὑποκεῖσθαι γάρ τι δεῖν. 

for there must be something underlying.  

καὶ οὕτω δὴ τὸ ἐφεξῆς συμβαῖνον αὔξοντες οὐδ' εἶναι πολλά φασιν ἀλλὰ μόνον αὐτὸ τὸ ὄν.

Thus, following this reasoning, they concluded that there are not many things, but only being itself.
## 192a
πρῶτον μὲν γὰρ ὁμολογοῦσιν ἁπλῶς γίγνεσθαί τι ἐκ μὴ [192a] ὄντος, ᾗ Παρμενίδην ὀρθῶς λέγειν· 

First of all, they agree in general that something comes to be from what is not, in which Parmenides is right.  

εἶτα φαίνεται αὐτοῖς, εἴπερ ἐστὶν ἀριθμῷ μία, καὶ δυνάμει μία μόνον εἶναι. 

Then, it appears to them that if something is one in number, it must also be one in power.  

τοῦτο δὲ διαφέρει πλεῖστον. 

This makes a great difference.  

ἡμεῖς μὲν γὰρ ὕλην καὶ στέρησιν ἕτερόν φαμεν εἶναι, καὶ τούτων τὸ μὲν οὐκ ὂν εἶναι κατὰ [192a.5] συμβεβηκός, τὴν ὕλην, τὴν δὲ στέρησιν καθ' αὑτήν, καὶ τὴν μὲν ἐγγὺς καὶ οὐσίαν πως, τὴν ὕλην, τὴν δὲ οὐδαμῶς· 

For we say that matter and privation are different, and that of these, one (matter) is not-being only incidentally, while privation is not-being in itself. We also say that matter is in some way close to substance, while privation is not at all.  

οἱ δὲ τὸ μὴ ὂν τὸ μέγα καὶ τὸ μικρὸν ὁμοίως, ἢ τὸ συναμφότερον ἢ τὸ χωρὶς ἑκάτερον. 

But others consider not-being as both the great and the small, either together or separately.  

ὥστε παντελῶς ἕτερος ὁ τρόπος οὗτος τῆς τριάδος κἀκεῖνος. 

Thus, this way of understanding the triad is entirely different from the other.  

μέχρι μὲν γὰρ δεῦρο προῆλθον, ὅτι δεῖ τινὰ ὑποκεῖσθαι φύσιν, ταύτην μέντοι μίαν ποιοῦσιν· 

For they have gone so far as to recognize that some underlying nature must exist, yet they make it only one.  

καὶ γὰρ εἴ τις δυάδα ποιεῖ, λέγων μέγα καὶ μι-
κρὸν αὐτήν, οὐθὲν ἧττον ταὐτὸ ποιεῖ· 

Even if someone calls it a dyad, saying that it is both great and small, it still remains the same; 

τὴν γὰρ ἑτέραν παρεῖδεν.

for they overlook the other.  

ἡ μὲν γὰρ ὑπομένουσα συναιτία τῇ μορφῇ τῶν γιγνομένων ἐστίν, ὥσπερ μήτηρ· 

The underlying nature is a joint cause with form in the coming to be of things, like a mother.  

ἡ δ' ἑτέρα μοῖρα τῆς ἐναντιώσεως πολλάκις ἂν φαντασθείη τῷ πρὸς τὸ κακοποιὸν αὐτῆς ἀτενίζοντι τὴν διάνοιαν οὐδ' εἶναι τὸ παράπαν. 

The other aspect of opposition often appears to the mind that focuses on its destructive nature as if it did not exist at all.  

ὄντος γάρ τινος θείου καὶ ἀγαθοῦ καὶ ἐφετοῦ, τὸ μὲν ἐναντίον αὐτῷ φαμεν εἶναι, τὸ δὲ ὃ πέφυκεν ἐφίεσθαι καὶ ὀρέγεσθαι αὐτοῦ κατὰ τὴν αὑτοῦ φύσιν. 

For since there is something divine, good, and desirable, we say that its opposite exists, as well as that which naturally strives and longs for it.  

τοῖς δὲ συμβαίνει τὸ ἐναντίον ὀρέγεσθαι τῆς αὑτοῦ φθορᾶς. 

But for some, the opposite occurs—they long for their own destruction.  

καίτοι οὔτε αὐτὸ αὑτοῦ οἷόν τε ἐφίεσθαι τὸ εἶδος διὰ τὸ μὴ εἶναι ἐνδεές, οὔτε τὸ ἐναντίον 

(φθαρτικὰ γὰρ ἀλλήλων τὰ ἐναντία), 

Yet neither a form desires itself (since it is not lacking anything), nor does its opposite, since opposites destroy each other.  

ἀλλὰ τοῦτ' ἔστιν ἡ ὕλη, ὥσπερ ἂν εἰ θῆλυ ἄρρενος καὶ αἰσχρὸν καλοῦ· 

Rather, this is the nature of matter, as when the female is to the male or the ugly is to the beautiful.  

πλὴν οὐ καθ' αὑτὸ αἰσχρόν, ἀλλὰ κατὰ συμβεβηκός, οὐδὲ θῆλυ, ἀλλὰ κατὰ συμβεβηκός. 

However, it is not ugly in itself, but only incidentally; nor is it female in itself, but only incidentally.  

[192a.25]  φθείρεται δὲ καὶ γίγνεται ἔστι μὲν ὥς, ἔστι δ' ὡς οὔ. 

Generation and destruction happen in one sense, but not in another.  

ὡς μὲν γὰρ τὸ ἐν ᾧ, καθ' αὑτὸ φθείρεται 

As the subject in which change occurs, something perishes in itself 

(τὸ γὰρ φθειρόμενον ἐν τούτῳ ἐστίν, ἡ στέρησις)· 

(for what perishes is in that, namely, privation).  

ὡς δὲ κατὰ δύναμιν, οὐ καθ' αὑτό, ἀλλ' ἄφθαρτον καὶ ἀγένητον ἀνάγκη αὐτὴν εἶναι. 

But in terms of potentiality, it does not perish in itself but must be imperishable and ungenerated.  

εἴτε γὰρ ἐγίγνετο, ὑποκεῖσθαί τι δεῖ πρῶτον ἐξ
οὗ ἐνυπάρχοντος· 

For if it were generated, something must first exist as its underlying subject, in which it inheres.  

τοῦτο δ' ἐστὶν αὐτὴ ἡ φύσις, ὥστ' ἔσται πρὶν γενέσθαι 

This is its very nature, so it must exist before coming to be.  

(λέγω γὰρ ὕλην τὸ πρῶτον ὑποκείμενον ἑκάστῳ, ἐξ οὗ γίγνεταί τι ἐνυπάρχοντος μὴ κατὰ συμβεβηκός)· 

(I mean by matter the first subject for each thing, from which something comes to be in itself, not incidentally.)  

εἴτε φθείρεται, εἰς τοῦτο ἀφίξεται ἔσχατον, ὥστε ἐφθαρμένη ἔσται πρὶν φθαρῆναι. 

If it perishes, it will ultimately arrive at this last state, meaning that it must have existed before perishing.  

περὶ δὲ τῆς κατὰ τὸ εἶδος ἀρχῆς, πότερον μία ἢ πολλαὶ καὶ τίς ἢ τίνες εἰσίν, δι' ἀκριβείας τῆς πρώτης φιλοσοφίας ἔργον ἐστὶν διορίσαι, ὥστ' εἰς ἐκεῖνον τὸν [192b] καιρὸν ἀποκείσθω. 

Regarding the formal principle—whether it is one or many and what it is—this is a matter to be determined with precision by first philosophy, so let that inquiry be set aside for now.
## 213b
οἱ δὲ ἄνθρωποι βούλονται κενὸν εἶναι διάστημα ἐν ᾧ μηδέν ἐστι σῶμα αἰσθητόν· οἰόμενοι δὲ τὸ ὂν ἅπαν εἶναι σῶμα φασίν, ἐν ᾧ ὅλως μηδέν ἐστι, τοῦτ' εἶναι κενόν, διὸ τὸ πλῆρες ἀέρος κενὸν εἶναι. οὔκουν τοῦτο δεῖ δεικνύναι, ὅτι ἐστί τι ὁ ἀήρ, ἀλλ' ὅτι οὐκ ἔστι διάστημα ἕτερον τῶν σωμάτων, οὔτε χωριστὸν οὔτε ἐνεργείᾳ ὄν, ὃ διαλαμβάνει τὸ πᾶν σῶμα ὥστε εἶναι μὴ συνεχές, 

But people really mean that there is an empty interval in which there is no sensible body. They hold that everything which is in body is body and say that what has nothing in it at all is void (so what is full of air is void). It is not then the existence of air that needs to be proved, but the non-existence of an interval, different from the bodies, either separable or actual-an interval which divides the whole body so as to break its continuity, 

καθάπερ λέγουσιν Δημόκριτος καὶ Λεύκιππος καὶ
[213b.1]   ἕτεροι πολλοὶ τῶν φυσιολόγων, ἢ καὶ εἴ τι ἔξω τοῦ παντὸς σώματός ἐστιν ὄντος συνεχοῦς.

as Democritus and Leucippus hold, and many other physicists-or even perhaps as something which is outside the whole body, which remains continuous.

[213b.2]                                             
οὗτοι μὲν οὖν οὐ κατὰ θύρας πρὸς τὸ πρόβλημα ἀπαντῶσιν, ἀλλ' οἱ φάσκοντες εἶναι μᾶλλον. 

These people, then, have not reached even the threshold of the problem, but rather those who say that the void exists.

λέγουσιν δ' ἓν μὲν ὅτι κίνησις ἡ κατὰ τόπον οὐκ ἂν εἴη (αὕτη δ' ἐστὶ φορὰ καὶ αὔξησις)· οὐ γὰρ ἂν δοκεῖν εἶναι κίνησιν, εἰ μὴ εἴη κενόν· τὸ γὰρ πλῆρες ἀδύνατον εἶναι δέξασθαί τι. εἰ δὲ δέξεται καὶ ἔσται δύο ἐν ταὐτῷ, ἐνδέχοιτ' ἂν καὶ ὁποσαοῦν εἶναι ἅμα σώματα· τὴν γὰρ διαφοράν, δι' ἣν οὐκ ἂν εἴη τὸ λεχθέν, οὐκ ἔστιν εἰπεῖν. εἰ δὲ τοῦτο ἐνδέχεται, καὶ τὸ μικρότατον δέξεται τὸ μέγιστον· πολλὰ γὰρ μικρὰ τὸ μέγα ἐστίν· ὥστε εἰ πολλὰ ἴσα ἐνδέχεται ἐν ταὐτῷ εἶναι, καὶ πολλὰ ἄνισα. 

(1) They argue, for one thing, that change in place (i.e. locomotion and increase) would not be. For it is maintained that motion would seem not to exist, if there were no void, since what is full cannot contain anything more. If it could, and there were two bodies in the same place, it would also be true that any number of bodies could be together; for it is impossible to draw a line of division beyond which the statement would become untrue. If this were possible, it would follow also that the smallest body would contain the greatest; for 'many a little makes a mickle': thus if many equal bodies can be together, so also can many unequal bodies.

Μέλισσος μὲν οὖν καὶ δείκνυσιν ὅτι τὸ πᾶν ἀκίνητον ἐκ τούτων· εἰ γὰρ κινήσεται, ἀνάγκη εἶναι (φησί) κενόν, τὸ δὲ κενὸν οὐ τῶν ὄντων. 

Melissus, indeed, infers from these considerations that the All is immovable; for if it were moved there must, he says, be void, but void is not among the things that exist.

ἕνα μὲν οὖν τρόπον ἐκ τούτων δεικνύουσιν ὅτι ἔστιν τι κενόν, 

This argument, then, is one way in which they show that there is a void.

ἄλλον δ' ὅτι φαίνεται ἔνια συνιόντα καὶ πιλούμενα, οἷον καὶ τὸν οἶνόν φασι δέχεσθαι μετὰ τῶν ἀσκῶν τοὺς πίθους, ὡς εἰς τὰ ἐνόντα κενὰ συνιόντος τοῦ πυκνουμένου σώματος. 

(2) They reason from the fact that some things are observed to contract and be compressed, as people say that a cask will hold the wine which formerly filled it, along with the skins into which the wine has been decanted, which implies that the compressed body contracts into the voids present in it.

ἔτι δὲ καὶ ἡ αὔξησις δοκεῖ πᾶσι γίγνεσθαι διὰ κενοῦ· τὴν μὲν γὰρ τροφὴν σῶμα εἶναι, δύο δὲ σώματα ἀδύνατον ἅμα εἶναι. 

Again (3) increase, too, is thought to take always by means of void, for nutriment is body, and it is impossible for two bodies to be together. 

μαρτύριον δὲ καὶ τὸ περὶ τῆς τέφρας ποιοῦνται, ἣ δέχεται ἴσον ὕδωρ ὅσον τὸ ἀγγεῖον τὸ κενόν. 

A proof of this they find also in what happens to ashes, which absorb as much water as the empty vessel.

εἶναι δ' ἔφασαν καὶ οἱ Πυθαγόρειοι κενόν, καὶ ἐπεισιέναι αὐτὸ τῷ οὐρανῷ ἐκ τοῦ ἀπείρου πνεύματος ὡς ἀναπνέοντι καὶ τὸ κενόν, ὃ διορίζει τὰς φύσεις, ὡς ὄντος τοῦ κενοῦ χωρισμοῦ τινὸς τῶν ἐφεξῆς καὶ [τῆς] διορίσεως· καὶ τοῦτ' εἶναι πρῶτον ἐν τοῖς ἀριθμοῖς· τὸ γὰρ κενὸν διορίζειν τὴν φύσιν αὐτῶν.

The Pythagoreans, too, (4) held that void exists and that it enters the heaven itself, which as it were inhales it, from the infinite air. Further it is the void which distinguishes the natures of things, as if it were like what separates and distinguishes the terms of a series. This holds primarily in the numbers, for the void distinguishes their nature.

ἐξ ὧν μὲν οὖν οἱ μέν φασιν εἶναι οἱ δ' οὔ φασι, σχεδὸν τοιαῦτα καὶ τοσαῦτά ἐστιν.

These, then, and so many, are the main grounds on which people have argued for and against the existence of the void.

Πρὸς δὲ τὸ ποτέρως ἔχει δεῖ λαβεῖν τί σημαίνει τοὔνομα. δοκεῖ δὴ τὸ κενὸν τόπος εἶναι ἐν ᾧ μηδέν ἐστι. τούτου δ' αἴτιον ὅτι τὸ ὂν σῶμα οἴονται εἶναι, πᾶν δὲ σῶμα ἐν τόπῳ, κενὸν δὲ ἐν ᾧ τόπῳ μηδέν ἐστι σῶμα, ὥστ' εἴ που μὴ ἔστι σῶμα, οὐδὲν εἶναι ἐνταῦθα
