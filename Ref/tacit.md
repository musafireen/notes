Ipsos Germanos indigenas crediderim minimeque aliarum gentium adventibus et hospitiis mixtos, quia nec terra olim sed classibus advehebantur qui mutare sedes quaerebant, et immensus ultra utque sic dixerim adversus Oceanus raris ab orbe nostro navibus aditur. [2] quis porro, praeter periculum horridi et ignoti maris, Asia aut Africa aut Italia relicta Germaniam peteret, informem terris, asperam caelo, tristem cultu aspectuque nisi si patria sit? [3]
Celebrant carminibus antiquis, quod unum apud illos memoriae et annalium genus est, Tuistonem deum terra editum. ei filium Mannum originem gentis conditoresque Manno tres filios adsignant, e quorum nominibus proximi Oceano Ingaevones, medii Herminones, ceteri Istaevones vocentur. [4] quidam, ut in licentia vetustatis, plures deo ortos pluresque gentis appellationes, Marsos Gambrivios Suebos Vandilios adfirmant, eaque vera et antiqua nomina. [5] ceterum Germaniae vocabulum recens et nuper additum, quoniam qui primi Rhenum transgressi Gallos expulerint ac nunc Tungri, tunc Germani vocati sint: ita nationis nomen, non gentis, evaluisse paulatim, ut omnes primum a victore ob metum, mox et a se ipsis invento nomine Germani vocarentur.

The Germans themselves I should regard as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times, it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive; and the boundless and, so to speak, hostile ocean beyond us, is seldom entered by a sail from our world. And, beside the perils of rough and unknown seas, who would leave Asia, or Africa, or Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home? In their ancient songs, their only way of remembering or recording the past, they celebrate an earth-born god, Tuisco, and his son Mannus, as the origin of their race, as their founders. To Mannus they assign three sons, from whose names, they say, the coast tribes are called Ingævones; those of the interior, Herminones; all the rest, Istævones. Some, with the freedom of conjecture permitted by antiquity, assert that the god had several descendants, and the nation several appellations, as Marsi, Gambrivii, Suevi, Vandilii, and that these are genuine old names. The name Germany, on the other hand, they say, is modern and newly introduced, from the fact that the tribes which first crossed the Rhine and drove out the Gauls, and are now called Tungrians, were then called Germans. Thus what was the name of a tribe, and not of a race, gradually prevailed, till all called themselves by this self-invented name of Germans, which the conquerors had first employed to inspire terror.

Primi per figuras animalium Aegyptii sensus mentis effingebant 

It was the Egyptians who first symbolized ideas, and 
DIGRESSION ON ALPHABET
that by the figures of animals. 

(ea antiquissima monimenta memoriae humanae impressa saxis cernuntur), 

These records, the most ancient of all human history, are still seen engraved on stone. 

et litterarum semet inventores perhibent; 

The Egyptians also claim to have invented the alphabet, 

inde Phoenicas, quia mari praepollebant, intulisse Graeciae gloriamque adeptos, 

which the Phœnicians, they say, by means of their superior seamanship, introduced into Greece, 

tamquam reppererint quae acceperant. 

and of which they appropriated the glory, giving out that they had discovered what they had really been taught. 

quippe fama est Cadmum classe Phoenicum vectum rudibus adhuc Graecorum populis artis eius auctorem fuisse. 

Tradition indeed says that Cadmus, visiting Greece in a Phœnician fleet, was the teacher of this art to its yet barbarous tribes. 

quidam Cecropem Atheniensem vel Linum Thebanum et temporibus Troianis Palamedem Argivum memorant sedecim litterarum formas, mox alios ac praecipuum Simoniden ceteras repperisse. 

According to one account, it was Cecrops of Athens or Linus of Thebes, or Palamedes of Argos in Trojan times who invented the shapes of sixteen letters, and others, chiefly Simonides, added the rest. 

at in Italia Etrusci ab Corinthio Demarato, Aborigines Arcade ab Evandro didicerunt; 

In Italy the Etrurians learnt them from Demaratus of Corinth, and the Aborigines from the Arcadian Evander. 

et forma litteris Latinis quae veterrimis Graecorum. 

And so the Latin letters have the same form as the oldest Greek characters. 

sed nobis quoque paucae primum fuere, deinde additae sunt. 

At first too our alphabet was scanty, and additions were afterwards made. 

quo exemplo Claudius tres litteras adiecit, quae usui imperi- tante eo, post oblitteratae, 

Following this precedent Claudius added three letters, which were employed during his reign and subsequently disused. 

aspiciuntur etiam nunc in aere publico †dis plebiscitis per fora ac templa fixo.

These may still be seen on the tablets of brass set up in the squares and temples, on which new statutes are published.

Rettulit deinde ad senatum super collegio haruspicum, 

Claudius then brought before the Senate the subject of the college of "haruspices," 

ne vetustissima Italiae disciplina per desidiam exolesceret: 

that, as he said, "the oldest of Italian sciences might not be lost through negligence. 

saepe adversis rei publicae temporibus accitos, quorum monitu redintegratas caerimonias et in posterum rectius habitas; primoresque Etruriae sponte aut patrum Romanorum impulsu retinuisse scientiam et in familias propagasse: quod nunc segnius fieri publica circa bonas artes socordia, et quia externae superstitiones valescant. et laeta quidem in praesens omnia, sed benignitati deum gratiam referendam, ne ritus sacrorum inter ambigua culti per prospera oblitterarentur. factum ex eo senatus consultum, viderent pontifices quae retinenda firmandaque haruspicum.

It had often happened in evil days for the State that advisers had been summoned at whose suggestion ceremonies had been restored and observed more duly for the future. The nobles of Etruria, whether of their own accord or at the instigation of the Roman Senate, had retained this science, making it the inheritance of distinct families. It was now less zealously studied through the general indifference to all sound learning and to the growth of foreign superstitions. At present all is well, but we must show gratitude to the favour of Heaven, by taking care that the rites observed during times of peril may not be forgotten in prosperity." A resolution of the Senate was accordingly passed, charging the pontiffs to see what should be retained or reformed with respect to the "haruspices.
