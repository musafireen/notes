### 16
तदत्र सुधियः प्राहुस्तुल्या सत्वेऽपि चोदना ।
यत्तस्यामुत्तरं वः स्यात्तत्तुल्यं सुधियामपि ॥ १६ ॥

In answer to this, the wise ones hectare that the argument that has been urged (by the sāṃkhya against the doctrine that the effect is non-existent prior to its production) is equally applicable to the doctrine of the existence of the effect. and the answer that you would have to that argument would equally aptly be the answer of the wise ones also.—(16)
