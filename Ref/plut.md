τῶν δὲ Γυμνοσοφιστῶν τοὺς μάλιστα τὸν Σάββαν ἀναπείσαντας ἀποστῆναι καὶ κακὰ πλεῖστα τοῖς Μακεδόσι παρασχόντας λαβὼν δέκα, δεινοὺς δοκοῦντας εἶναι περὶ τὰς ἀποκρίσεις [p. 406] καὶ βραχυλόγους, ἐρωτήματα προὔβαλεν αὐτοῖς ἄπορα, φήσας ἀποκτενεῖν τὸν μὴ ὀρθῶς ἀποκρινάμενον πρῶτον, εἶτα ἐφεξῆς οὕτω τοὺς ἄλλους ἕνα δὲ τὸν πρεσβύτατον ἐκέλευσε κρίνειν. 

He captured ten of the Gymnosophists who had done most to get Sabbas to revolt, and had made the most trouble for the Macedonians. These philosophers were reputed to be clever and concise in answering questions, and Alexander therefore put difficult questions to them, declaring that he would put to death him who first made an incorrect answer, and then the rest, in an order determined in like manner; and he commanded one of them, the oldest, to be judge in the contest.

### 2
ὁ μὲν οὖν πρῶτος ἐρωτηθείς πότερον οἴεται τοὺς ζῶντας εἶναι πλείονας ἢ τοὺς τεθνηκότας, ἔφη τοὺς ζῶντας οὐκέτι γὰρ εἶναι τοὺς τεθνηκότας. ὁ δὲ δεύτερος, πότερον τὴν γῆν ἢ τὴν θάλατταν μείζονα τρέφειν θηρία, τὴν γῆν ταύτης γὰρ μέρος εἶναι τὴν θάλατταν. ὁ δὲ τρίτος, ποῖόν ἐστι ζῷον πανουργότατον, ‘ὃ μέχρι νῦν,’ εἶπεν, ‘ ἄνθρωπος οὐκ ἔγνωκεν.’

The first one, accordingly, being asked which, in his opinion, were more numerous, the living or the dead, said that the living were, since the dead no longer existed. The second, being asked whether the earth or the sea produced larger animals, said the earth did, since the sea was but a part of the earth. The third, being asked what animal was most cunning, said: ‘That which up to this time man has not discovered.’

### 3


The fourth, when asked why he had induced Sabbas to revolt, replied: ‘Because I wished him either to live nobly or to die nobly.’ The fifth, being asked which, in his opinion, was older, day or night, replied: ‘Day, by one day’; and he added, upon the king expressing amazement, that hard questions must have hard answers.

### 4
μεταβαλὼν οὖν τὸν ἕκτον ἠρώτα πῶς ἄν τις φιληθείη μάλιστα: ‘ἂν κράτιστος ὤν,’ ἔφη, ‘μὴ φοβερὸς ᾖ.’ τῶν δὲ λοιπῶν τριῶν ὁ μὲν ἐρωτηθείς πῶς ἄν τις ἐξ ἀνθρώπων γένοιτο θεός, ‘εἴ τι πράξειεν,’ εἶπεν, ‘ὃ πρᾶξαι δυνατὸν ἀνθρώπῳ μὴ ἔστιν’ ὁ δὲ περὶ ζῳῆς καὶ θανάτου, πότερον ἰσχυρότερον, ἀπεκρίνατο τὴν ζῳήν τοσαῦτα κακὰ φέρουσαν.

Passing on, then, to the sixth, Alexander asked how a man could be most loved; ‘If,’ said the philosopher, ‘he is most powerful, and yet does not inspire fear.’ Of the three remaining, he who was asked how one might become a god instead of man, replied: ‘By doing something which a man cannot do’; the one who was asked which was the stronger, life or death, answered: ‘Life, since it supports so many ills.’ 
### 5
ὁ δὲ τελευταῖος, μέχρι τίνος ἀνθρώπῳ καλῶς ἔχον ζῆν, ‘μέχρι οὗ μὴ νομίζει τὸ τεθνάναι τοῦ ζῆν ἄμεινον.’ οὕτω δὴ τραπόμενος πρὸς τὸν δικαστήν ἐκέλευσεν ἀποφαίνεσθαι. τοῦ δὲ ἕτερον ἑτέρου χεῖρον εἰρηκέναι φήσαντος ‘οὐκοῦν’ ἔφη, ‘σὺ [p. 408] πρῶτος ἀποθανῇ τοιαῦτα κρίνων’ ‘οὐκ ἄν γε,’ εἶπεν, ‘ὦ βασιλεῦ, εἰ μὴ σὺ ψεύδῃ φήσας πρῶτον ἀποκτενεῖν τὸν ἀποκρινάμενον κάκιστα.’ 

And the last, asked how long it were well for a man to live, answered: ‘Until he does not regard death as better than life.’ So, then, turning to the judge, Alexander bade him give his opinion. The judge declared that they had answered one worse than another. ‘Well, then,’ said Alexander, ‘thou shalt die first for giving such a verdict.’ ‘That cannot be, O King,’ said the judge, ‘unless thou falsely saidst that thou wouldst put to death first him who answered worst.’

### 1
τούτους μὲν οὖν ἀφῆκε δωρησάμενος πρὸς δὲ τοὺς ἓν δόξῃ μάλιστα καί καθ᾽ αὑτοὺς ἐν ἡσυχίᾳ ζῶντας ἔπεμψεν Ὀνησίκριτον, ἀφικέσθαι δεόμενος πρὸς αὐτὸν, ὁ δὲ Ὀνησίκριτος ἦν φιλόσοφος τῶν Διογένει τῷ κυνικῷ συνεσχολακότων. 

These philosophers, then, he dismissed with gifts; but to those who were in the highest repute and lived quietly by themselves he sent Onesicritus, asking them to pay him a visit. Now, Onesicritus was a philosopher of the school of Diogenes the Cynic.
### 2
καί φησι τὸν μὲν Καλανὸν ὑβριστικῶς πάνυ καί τραχέως κελεύειν ἀποδύντα τὸν χιτῶνα γυμνὸν ἀκροᾶσθαι τῶν λόγων ἄλλως δὲ οὐ διαλέξεσθαι πρὸς αὐτὸν, οὐδ᾽ εἰ παρὰ τοῦ Διὸς ἀφῖκται τὸν δὲ Δάνδαμιν πρᾳότερον εἶναι, καί διακούσαντα περὶ Σωκράτους καί Πυθαγόρου καί Διογένους εἰπεῖν ὡς εὐφυεῖς μὲν αὐτῷ γεγονέναι δοκοῦσιν οἱ ἄνδρες, λίαν δὲ τοὺς νόμους αἰσχυνόμενοι βεβιωκέναι. 

And he tells us that Calanus very harshly and insolently bade him strip off his tunic and listen naked to what he had to say, otherwise he would not converse with him, not even if he came from Zeus; but he says that Dandamis was gentler, and that after hearing fully about Socrates, Pythagoras, and Diogenes, he remarked that the men appeared to him to have been of good natural parts but to have passed their lives in too much awe of the laws.
### 3
ἄλλοι δέ φασι τὸν Δάνδαμιν οὐδὲν εἰπεῖν ἀλλ᾽ ἢ τοσοῦτον μόνον ‘τίνος χάριν ὁ Ἀλέξανδρος ὁδὸν τοσαύτην δεῦρ᾽ ἦλθε;’ τὸν μέντοι Καλανὸν ἔπεισεν ὁ Ταξίλης ἐλθεῖν πρὸς Ἀλέξανδρον. ἐκαλεῖτο δὲ Σφίνης ἐπεὶ δὲ κατ᾽ Ἰνδικὴν γλῶτταν τῷ καλὲ προσαγορεύων ἀντὶ τοῦ χαίρειν τοὺς ἐντυγχάνοντας ἠσπάζετο, Καλανὸς ὑπὸ τῶν Ἑλλήνων ὠνομάσθη. τοῦτον δὲ λέγεται καί τὸ παράδειγμα τῆς ἀρχῆς τῷ Ἀλεξάνδρῳ προθέσθαι.

Others, however, say that the only words uttered by Dandamis were these: ‘Why did Alexander make such a long journey hither?’ Calanus, nevertheless, was persuaded by Taxiles to pay a visit to Alexander. His real name was Sphines, but because he greeted those whom he met with ‘Cale,’ the Indian word of salutation, the Greeks called him Calanus. It was Calanus, as we are told, who laid before Alexander the famous illustration of government. It was this.
### 4
καταβαλὼν γὰρ ἐν μέσῳ βύρσαν τινὰ ξηρὰν καί κατεσκληκυῖαν ἐπάτησε τὸ ἄκρον ἡ δὲ εἰς ἓν πιεσθεῖσα τοῖς ἄλλοις ἐπήρθη μέρεσι. καί τοῦτο περιϊὼν ἐν κύκλῳ καί πιέζων καθ᾽ ἕκαστον ἐδείκνυε γιγνόμενον, ἄχρι οὗ τὸ μέσον ἐπιστὰς κατέσχε καί πάντα οὕτως [p. 410] ἠρέμησεν. ἐβούλετο δὲ ἡ εἰκὼν ἔνδειξις εἶναι τοῦ τὰ μέσα δεῖν μάλιστα τῆς ἀρχῆς πιέζειν καὶ μὴ μακρὰν ἀποπλανᾶσθαι τὸν Ἀλέξανδρον. 

He threw down upon the ground a dry and shrivelled hide, and set his foot upon the outer edge of it; the hide was pressed down in one place, but rose up in others. He went all round the hide and showed that this was the result wherever he pressed the edge down, and then at last he stood in the middle of it, and lo! it was all held down firm and still. The similitude was designed to show that Alexander ought to put most constraint upon the middle of his empire and not wander far away from it.

ἄλλην οὖν τοσαύτην διελθὼν ὁδὸν ἔδοξεν ἀφορᾶν κρατῆρα μέγαν, εἰς δὲ τοῦτον ἐμβάλλοντα ῥεύματα, τὸ μὲν ἀφροῦ θαλάσσης ἢ χιόνων λευκότερον, τὸ δ᾽ ὁποῖον ἶρις 1 ἐξανθεῖ τὸ ἁλουργόν, ἄλλα δ᾽ ἄλλαις βαφαῖς κεχρωσμένα πρόσωθεν ἴδιον ἐχούσαις φέγγος: ὡς δὲ πλησίον ἦλθον, ὁ κρατὴρ ἐκεῖνος, ἀφανισθέντος μᾶλλον τοῦ περιέχοντος τῶν τε χρωμάτων ἀμαυρουμένων, τὸ ἀνθηρότερον ἀπέλιπε [p. 462] πλὴν τῆς λευκότητος. ἑώρα δὲ τρεῖς δαίμονας ὁμοῦ καθημένους ἐν σχήματι τριγώνου πρὸς ἀλλήλους τὰ ῥεύματα μέτροις τισὶν ἀνακεραννύντας. ἔλεγεν οὖν

At length, after he had been carried as far another way as when he was transported to the yawning overture, he [p. 184] thought he beheld a prodigious standing goblet, into which several rivers discharged themselves; among which there was one whiter than snow or the foam of the sea, another resembled the purple color of the rainbow. The tinctures of the rest were various; besides that, they had their several lustres at a distance. But when he drew nearer, the ambient air became more subtile and rarefied, and the colors vanished, so the goblet retained no more of its flourishing beauty except the white. At the same time he saw three Daemons sitting together in a triangular aspect, and blending and mixing the rivers together with certain measures. 

## 566c
ὁ τοῦ Θεσπεσίου ψυχοπομπὸς ἄχρι τούτου τὸν Ὀρφέα προελθεῖν, 1 ὅτε τὴν ψυχὴν τῆς γυναικὸς μετῄει, καὶ μὴ καλῶς διαμνημονεύσαντα λόγον εἰς ἀνθρώπους κίβδηλον ἐξενεγκεῖν, ὡς κοινὸν εἴη μαντεῖον ἐν Δελφοῖς Ἀπόλλωνος καὶ Νυκτός: οὐδενὸς γὰρ Ἀπόλλωνι Νύκτα κοινωνεῖν ‘ἀλλὰ τοῦτο μέν’ ἔφη ‘νυκτὸς ἐστι καὶ Σελήνης μαντεῖον κοινόν, οὐδαμοῦ τῆς γῆς περαῖνον οὐδ᾽ ἔχον ἕδραν μίαν, ἀλλὰ πάντῃ πλανητὸν ἐπὶ τοὺς ἀνθρώπους ἐνυπνίοις καὶ εἰδώλοις: ἐκ τούτου γὰρ οἱ ὄνειροι μιγνύμενοι, ὡς ὁρᾷς, τῷ ἀπατηλῷ καὶ ποικίλῳ τὸ ἁπλοῦν καὶ ἀληθὲς παραλαμβάνοντες 2 

’διασπείρουσι. 

Thus far, said the guide of Thespesius's soul, did Orpheus come, when he sought after the soul of his wife; and not well remembering what he had seen, upon his return he raised a false report in the world, that the oracle at Delphi was in common to Night and Apollo, whereas Apollo never had any thing in common with Night. But, said the spirit, this oracle is in common to Night and to the Moon, no way included within earthly bounds, nor having any fixed or certain seat, but always wandering among men in dreams and visions. For from hence it is that all dreams are dispersed, compounded as they are of truth jumbled with falsehood, and sincerity with the various mixtures of craft and delusion. 

## 566d
τὸ δ᾽ Ἀπόλλωνος οὐ κατεῖδες 1’ εἶπεν ‘οὐδὲ κατιδεῖν ἔσῃ δυνατός ἀνωτέρω γὰρ οὐκ ἐπιδίδωσιν οὐδὲ χαλᾷ τὸ τῆς ψυχῆς ἐπίγειον ἀλλὰ κατατείνει τῷ σώματι προσηρτημένον’ ἅμα δ᾽ ἐπειρᾶτο προσάγων ἐπιδεικνύειν αὐτῷ τὸ φῶς ἐκ τοῦ τρίποδος, ὡς ἔλεγε, διὰ τῶν κόλπων τῆς Θέμιδος ἀπερειδόμενον εἰς τὸν Παρνασόν. 

καὶ προθυμούμενος ἰδεῖν οὐκ εἶδεν ὑπὸ λαμπρότητος, ἀλλ᾽ ἤκουε παριὼν φωνὴν ὀξεῖαν γυναικὸς ἐν μέτρῳ φράζουσαν ἄλλα τινὰ καὶ χρόνον, ὡς ἔοικε, τῆς ἐκείνου τελευτῆς. 

But as for the oracle of Apollo, said the spirit, you neither do see it, neither can you behold it; for the earthly part of the soul is not capable to release or let itself loose, nor is it permitted to reach sublimity, but it swags downward, as being fastened to the body.

And with that, leading Thespesius nearer, the spirit endeavored to show him the light of the Tripod, which, as he said, shooting through the bosom of Themis, fell upon Parnassus; which Thespesius was desirous to see, but could not, in regard the extraordinary brightness of the light dazzled his eyes; 
only passing by, he heard the shrill voice of a woman speaking in verse and measure, and [p. 185] among other things, as he thought, foretelling the time of his death. 

ἔλεγε δ᾽᾽ ὁ δαίμων τὴν φωνὴν εἶναι Σιβύλλης: ᾁδειν γὰρ αὐτὴν περὶ τῶν μελλόντων ἐν τῷ προσώπῳ

τῆς σελήνης περιφερομένην. 

This the genius told him was the voice of a Sibyl who, being orbicularly whirled about in the face of the moon, continually sang of future events.

ἄλλο πεποιημένοις ἔργον ἢ γνῶσιν καὶ μάθησιν τοῦ ὄντος εὖ μάλα δυσθήρατός ἐστι καὶ δύσληπτος, ὡς ὁμολογοῦσιν αὐτοί. Καὶ τὰ Ἐμπεδοκλέους ἔστω πρόχειρα ταυτί·

exceedingly hard to track down and hard to get hold of, as they themselves admit; and let these words of Empedocles be constantly in mind:

Οὕτως οὔτ´ ἐπιδερκτὰ τάδ´ ἀνδράσιν οὔτ´ ἐπακουστὰ
οὔτε νόῳ περιληπτά,

Thus no eye of man hath seen nor ear hath heard this,
Nor can it be comprehended by the mind,26

καὶ τὰ Ξενοφάνους·

Καὶ τὸ μὲν οὖν σαφὲς οὔτις ἀνὴρ γένετ´ οὐδέ τις ἔσται

and the words of Xenophanes:

Never yet was born a man nor ever shall be
### 17f
εἰδὼς ἀμφὶ θεῶν τε καὶ ἅσσα λέγω περὶ πάντων,

FKnowing the truth about the gods and what I say of all things,27

καὶ νὴ Δία τὰ Σωκράτους ἐξομνυμένου παρὰ Πλάτωνι τὴν περὶ τούτων γνῶσιν. Ἧττον γὰρ ὡς εἰδόσι τι περὶ τούτων προσέξουσι τοῖς ποιηταῖς ἐν οἷς τοὺς φιλοσόφους ἰλιγγιῶντας ὁρῶσιν.

and by all means the words of Socrates, in Plato,28 when he solemnly disavows all acquaintance with these subjects. For young people then will give less heed to the poets, as having some knowledge of these matters, when they see that such questions stagger the philosophers.

Ἔτι δὲ μᾶλλον ἐπιστήσομεν αὐτὸν ἅμα τῷ προσάγειν τοῖς ποιήμασιν ὑπογράφοντες τὴν ποιητικὴν ὅτι μιμητικὴ τέχνη καὶ δύναμίς ἐστιν ἀντίστροφος τῇ ζῳγραφίᾳ. Καὶ μὴ μόνον ἐκεῖνο τὸ θρυλούμενον ἀκηκοὼς ἔστω, ζῳγραφίαν μὲν εἶναι

We shall steady the young man still more if, at his first entrance into poetry, we give a general description of the poetic art as an imitative art and faculty analogous to painting. And let him not  p93 merely be acquainted with the oft‑repeated saying that "poetry is articulate painting,

Ἠθικὰ Πλουτάρχου· 26. 367 c. d Περὶ Ἴσιδος καὶ Ὀσίριδος:

Οἱ δὲ τοῖσδε τοῖς φυσικοῖς καὶ τῶν ἀπ´ ἀστρολογίας μαθηματικῶν ἔνια μιγνύντες Τυφῶνα μὲν οἴονται τὸν ἡλιακὸν κόσμον, Ὄσιριν δὲ τὸν σεληνιακὸν λέγεσθαι· τὴν μὲν γὰρ σελήνην γόνιμον τὸ φῶς καὶ ὑγροποιὸν ἔχουσαν εὐμενῆ καὶ γοναῖς ζῴων καὶ φυτῶν εἶναι βλαστήσεσι· τὸν δ´ ἥλιον ἀκράτῳ πυρὶ καὶ σκληρῷ καταθάλπειν {τε} καὶ καταυαίνειν τὰ φυόμενα καὶ τεθηλότα καὶ τὸ πολὺ μέρος τῆς γῆς παντάπασιν ὑπὸ φλογμοῦ ποιεῖν ἀοίκητον καὶ κατακρατεῖν πολλαχοῦ καὶ τῆς σελήνης. 

“But those who join with these physiological accounts certain mathematical matters relating to astronomy suppose Typhon to mean the world of the sun, and Osiris that of the moon; for that the moon, being endued with a prolific and moistening light, is very favorable both to the breeding of animals and the springing up of plants; but the sun, having in it an immoderate and excessive fire, burns and dries up such things as grow up and look green, and by its scorching heat renders a great part of the world wholly uninhabitable, and very often gets the better of the moon.” (trans. William W. Goodwin, 1874)
