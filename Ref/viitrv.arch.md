At si qui subtilior fuerit et voluerit expolitionem miniaceam suum colorem retinere, cum paries expolitus et aridus fuerit, ceram ponticam igni liquefactam paulo oleo temperatam saeta inducat; 

But anybody who is more particular, and who wants a polished finish of vermilion that will keep its proper colour, should, after the wall has been polished and is dry, apply with a brush Pontic wax melted over a fire and mixed with a little oil; 

deinde postea carbonibus in ferreo vase compositis eam ceram una cum pariete calfaciundo sudare cogat lietque, ut peraequetur; 

then after this he should bring the wax to a sweat by warming it and the wall at close quarters with charcoal enclosed in an iron vessel; 

deinde tunc candela centunculisque puris subigat, uti signa marmorea nuda curantur (haec autem γάνωσις graece dicitur):

and finally he should smooth it all off by rubbing it down with a wax candle and clean linen cloths, just as naked marble statues are treated.
