अश्वमेधं  गवालम्भं

सन्न्यासं  पल-पैतृकम्

देवरेण  सुतोत्पत्तिं

कलौ  पञ्च  विवर्जयेत्

In this Age of Kali, five acts are forbidden: the offering of a horse in sacrifice, the offering of a cow in sacrifice, the acceptance of the order of sannyāsa, the offering of oblations of flesh to the forefathers, and a man's begetting children in his brother's wife.
