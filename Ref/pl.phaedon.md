"Why in the world do they say that it is not permitted to kill oneself, Socrates? 
Κατὰ τί δὴ οὖν ποτε οὔ φασι θεμιτὸν εἶναι αὐτὸν ἑαυτὸν ἀποκτεινύναι͵ ὦ Σώκρατες;  
I heard Philolaus, when he was living in our city, say the same thing you just said, and I have heard it from others, too, that one must not do this; 
ἤδη γὰρ ἔγωγε͵ ὅπερ νυνδὴ σὺ ἤρου͵ καὶ Φιλολάου ἤκουσα͵ ὅτε παρ΄ ἡμῖν διῃτᾶτο͵ ἤδη δὲ καὶ ἄλλων τινῶν͵ ὡς οὐ δέοι τοῦτο ποιεῖν·
but I never heard anyone say anything definite about it.”
σαφὲς δὲ περὶ αὐτῶν οὐδενὸς πώποτε οὐδὲν ἀκήκοα.

# 62a

“You must have courage,” said he,   
Ἀλλὰ προθυμεῖσθαι χρή͵ ἔφη·
“and perhaps you might hear something. 
τάχα γὰρ ἂν καὶ ἀκούσαις.
I suppose that you wonder why, 
ἴσως μέντοι θαυμαστόν σοι φανεῖται 
as most things which are evil may be accidentally good, this is to be the only exception
εἰ τοῦτο μόνον τῶν ἄλλων ἁπάντων ἁπλοῦν ἐστιν͵ καὶ οὐδέποτε τυγχάνει τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ͵ ὥσπερ καὶ τἆλλα͵ 
(for may not death, too, be better than life in some cases?),
ἔστιν ὅτε καὶ οἷς βέλτιον ὂν τεθνάναι ἢ ζῆν͵
and why, when a man is better dead, he is not permitted to be his own benefactor, 
οἷς δὲ βέλτιον τεθνάναι͵ θαυμαστὸν ἴσως σοι φαίνεται εἰ τούτοις τοῖς ἀνθρώποις μὴ ὅσιον αὐτοὺς ἑαυτοὺς εὖ ποιεῖν͵ 
but must wait for the hand of another.
ἀλλὰ ἄλλον δεῖ περιμένειν εὐεργέτην.
By Jupiter! yes, indeed, said Cebes, laughing, 
Καὶ ὁ Κέβης ἠρέμα ἐπιγελάσας͵ Ἴττω Ζεύς͵ ἔφη͵
and speaking in his native Doric.
τῇ αὑτοῦ φωνῇ εἰπών.

# 62b
[pl.phaedo.62b](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0170:text=Phaedo:section=62bd)
“It would seem unreasonable, if put in this way,” said Socrates,
Καὶ γὰρ ἂν δόξειεν͵ ἔφη ὁ Σωκράτης͵ οὕτω γ΄ εἶναι ἄλογον·
but perhaps there is some reason in it.
οὐ μέντοι ἀλλ΄ ἴσως γ΄ ἔχει τινὰ λόγον. 
Now the doctrine that is taught in secret about this matter, that we men are in a kind of prison 
ὁ μὲν οὖν ἐν ἀπορρήτοις λεγόμενος περὶ αὐτῶν λόγος͵ ὡς ἔν τινι φρουρᾷ ἐσμεν οἱ ἄνθρωποι  
and must not set ourselves free or run away, 
καὶ οὐ δεῖ δὴ ἑαυτὸν ἐκ ταύτης λύειν οὐδ΄ ἀποδιδράσκειν͵ 
seems to me to be weighty and not easy to understand. 
μέγας τέ τίς μοι φαίνεται καὶ οὐ ῥᾴδιος διιδεῖν· 
But this at least, Cebes, I do believe is sound, that the gods are our guardians 
οὐ μέντοι ἀλλὰ τόδε γέ μοι δοκεῖ͵ ὦ Κέβης͵ εὖ λέγεσθαι͵ τὸ θεοὺς εἶναι ἡμῶν τοὺς ἐπιμελουμένους 
and that we men are one of the chattels to the gods. 
καὶ ἡμᾶς τοὺς ἀνθρώπους ἓν τῶν κτημάτων τοῖς θεοῖς εἶναι. 
Or does it not seem to you thus?”                             
ἢ σοὶ οὐ δοκεῖ οὕτως;
To me at least, said Cebes.           
Ἔμοιγε͵ φησὶν ὁ Κέβης. 

# 62c
[pl.phaedo.62c](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0170:text=Phaedo:section=62c)
And if one of your own possessions, an ox or an ass, for example took the liberty of putting himself out of the way   
Οὐκοῦν͵ ἦ δ΄ ὅς͵ καὶ σὺ ἂν τῶν σαυτοῦ κτημάτων εἴ τι αὐτὸ ἑαυτὸ ἀποκτεινύοι͵     
when you had given no intimation of your wish that he should die,
μὴ σημήναντός σου ὅτι βούλει αὐτὸ τεθνάναι͵
would you not be angry with him,    
χαλεπαίνοις ἂν αὐτῷ
and would you not punish him if you could?
καί͵ εἴ τινα ἔχοις τιμωρίαν͵ τιμωροῖο ἄν;
Certainly, replied Cebes.                      
Πάνυ γ΄͵ ἔφη.
Then perhaps from this point of view it is not unreasonable to say that a man must not kill himself 
Ἴσως τοίνυν ταύτῃ οὐκ ἄλογον μὴ πρότερον αὑτὸν ἀποκτεινύναι δεῖν͵ 
until god sends some necessity upon him, 
πρὶν ἀνάγκην τινὰ θεὸς ἐπιπέμψῃ͵ 
such as has now come upon me. (...)       
ὥσπερ καὶ τὴν νῦν ἡμῖν παροῦσαν. (...)

# 64c
[pl.phaedo.64c](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0170:text=Phaedo:section=64c)
But let us leave them and have a word with ourselves: 
εἴπωμεν γάρ͵ ἔφη͵ πρὸς ἡμᾶς αὐτούς͵ χαίρειν εἰπόντες ἐκείνοις· 
Do we believe that there is such a thing as death?
ἡγούμεθά τι τὸν θάνατον εἶναι;
To be sure, replied Simmias.               
Πάνυ γε͵ ἔφη ὑπολαβὼν ὁ Σιμμίας. 
And is this anything but the separation of soul and body? 
Ἆρα μὴ ἄλλο τι ἢ τὴν τῆς ψυχῆς ἀπὸ τοῦ σώματος ἀπαλλαγήν; 
And being dead is the attainment of this separation; 
καὶ εἶναι τοῦτο τὸ τεθνάναι͵ 
when the soul exists in herself,          
χωρὶς μὲν ἀπὸ τῆς ψυχῆς 
and is parted from the body               
ἀπαλλαγὲν αὐτὸ καθ΄ αὑτὸ τὸ σῶμα γεγονέναι͵ 
and the body is parted from the soul-
χωρὶς δὲ τὴν ψυχὴν [ἀπὸ] τοῦ σώματος ἀπαλλαγεῖσαν αὐτὴν καθ΄ αὑτὴν εἶναι; 
that is death?                                         
ἆρα μὴ ἄλλο τι ᾖ ὁ θάνατος ἢ τοῦτο;
Exactly: that and nothing else, he replied. 
Οὔκ͵ ἀλλὰ τοῦτο͵ ἔφη. 
And what do you say of another question, my friend, about which I should like to have your opinion, 
Σκέψαι δή͵ ὠγαθέ͵ ἐὰν ἄρα καὶ σοὶ συνδοκῇ ἅπερ ἐμοί· 
and the answer to which will probably throw light on our present inquiry: 

# 64d
[pl.phaedo.64d](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0170:text=Phaedo:section=64d)
ἐκ γὰρ τούτων μᾶλλον οἶμαι ἡμᾶς εἴσεσθαι περὶ ὧν σκοποῦμεν. 
Do you think that the philosopher ought to care about the pleasures-
φαίνεταί σοι φιλοσόφου ἀνδρὸς εἶναι ἐσπουδακέναι περὶ τὰς ἡδονὰς  
if they are to be called pleasures-      
καλουμένας τὰς τοιάσδε͵
of eating and drinking?                       
οἷον σιτίων [τε] καὶ ποτῶν;
Certainly not, answered Simmias.     
῞Ηκιστα͵ ὦ Σώκρατες͵ ἔφη ὁ Σιμμίας.   
And what do you say of the pleasures of love-should he care about them?
Τί δὲ τὰς τῶν ἀφροδισίων;
By no means.                                         
Οὐδαμῶς.
And will he think much of the other ways of indulging the body-
Τί δὲ τὰς ἄλλας τὰς περὶ τὸ σῶμα θεραπείας;
What do you say?                                 
δοκεῖ σοι ἐντίμους ἡγεῖσθαι ὁ τοιοῦτος; 
for example, the acquisition of costly raiment, or sandals, or other adornments of the body? 
οἷον ἱματίων διαφερόντων κτήσεις καὶ ὑποδημάτων καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους καλλωπισμοὺς τοὺς περὶ τὸ σῶμα 
Instead of caring about them,            
πότερον τιμᾶν δοκεῖ σοι 
does he not rather despise anything more than nature needs?

# 64e
[pl.phaedo.64e](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0170:text=Phaedo:section=64e)
ἢ ἀτιμάζειν͵ καθ΄ ὅσον μὴ πολλὴ ἀνάγκη μετέχειν αὐτῶν;
I should say the true philosopher would despise them. 
Ἀτιμάζειν ἔμοιγε δοκεῖ͵ ἔφη͵ ὅ γε ὡς ἀληθῶς φιλόσοφος. 
Would you not say that he is entirely concerned with the soul and not with the body? 
Οὐκοῦν ὅλως δοκεῖ σοι͵ ἔφη͵ ἡ τοῦ τοιούτου πραγματεία οὐ περὶ τὸ σῶμα εἶναι͵ 
He would like, as far as he can, to be quit of the body and turn to the soul.
ἀλλὰ καθ΄ ὅσον δύναται ἀφεστάναι αὐτοῦ͵ πρὸς δὲ τὴν ψυχὴν τετράφθαι;
That is true.                                           
Ἔμοιγε.

# 65a
[pl.phaedo.65a](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0170:text=Phaedo:section=65a)
In matters of this sort philosophers, above all other men, may be observed in every sort of way to dissever the soul from the body.
Ἆρ΄ οὖν πρῶτον μὲν ἐν τοῖς τοιούτοις δῆλός ἐστιν ὁ φιλόσοφος ἀπολύων ὅτι μάλιστα τὴν ψυχὴν ἀπὸ τῆς τοῦ σώματος κοινωνίας διαφερόντως τῶν ἄλλων ἀνθρώπων;
That is true.                                           
Φαίνεται.
Whereas, Simmias, the rest of the world are of opinion that 
Καὶ δοκεῖ γέ που͵ ὦ Σιμμία͵ τοῖς πολλοῖς ἀνθρώποις  
a life which has no bodily pleasures and no part in them is not worth having; 
ᾧ μηδὲν ἡδὺ τῶν τοιούτων μηδὲ μετέχει αὐτῶν οὐκ ἄξιον εἶναι ζῆν͵
but that he who thinks nothing of bodily pleasures is almost as though he were dead.
ἀλλ΄ ἐγγύς τι τείνειν τοῦ τεθνάναι ὁ μηδὲν φροντίζων τῶν ἡδονῶν αἳ διὰ τοῦ σώματός εἰσιν.
That is quite true.                                 
Πάνυ μὲν οὖν ἀληθῆ λέγεις.
What again shall we say of the actual acquirement of knowledge?
Τί δὲ δὴ περὶ αὐτὴν τὴν τῆς φρονήσεως κτῆσιν;

# 65b
[pl.phaedo.65b](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0170:text=Phaedo:section=65b)
-is the body, if invited to share in the inquiry, a hinderer or a helper?
 πότερον ἐμπόδιον τὸ σῶμα ἢ οὔ͵ ἐάν τις αὐτὸ ἐν τῇ ζητήσει κοινωνὸν συμπαραλαμβάνῃ;
I mean to say, have sight and hearing any truth in them?
οἷον τὸ τοιόνδε λέγω· ἆρα ἔχει ἀλήθειάν τινα ὄψις τε καὶ ἀκοὴ τοῖς ἀνθρώποις͵
Are they not, as the poets are always telling us, inaccurate witnesses? 
ἢ τά γε τοιαῦτα καὶ οἱ ποιηταὶ ἡμῖν ἀεὶ θρυλοῦσιν͵ ὅτι οὔτ΄ ἀκούομεν ἀκριβὲς οὐδὲν οὔτε ὁρῶμεν;  
and yet, if even they are inaccurate and indistinct, what is to be said of the other senses?-
καίτοι εἰ αὗται τῶν περὶ τὸ σῶμα αἰσθήσεων μὴ ἀκριβεῖς εἰσιν μηδὲ σαφεῖς͵ σχολῇ αἵ γε ἄλλαι· πᾶσαι γάρ που τούτων φαυλότεραί εἰσιν.
for you will allow that they are the best of them?
ἢ σοὶ οὐ δοκοῦσιν;
Certainly, he replied.                            
Πάνυ μὲν οὖν͵ ἔφη.   
Then when does the soul attain truth?-
Πότε οὖν͵ ἦ δ΄ ὅς͵ ἡ ψυχὴ τῆς ἀληθείας ἅπτεται;
for in attempting to consider anything in company with the body she is obviously deceived.
ὅταν μὲν γὰρ μετὰ τοῦ σώματος ἐπιχειρῇ τι σκοπεῖν͵ δῆλον ὅτι τότε ἐξαπατᾶται ὑπ΄ αὐτοῦ.

# 65c
[pl.phaedo.65c](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0170:text=Phaedo:section=65c)
Yes, that is true. Then must not existence be revealed to her in thought, if at all?
 Ἀληθῆ λέγεις. Ἆρ΄ οὖν οὐκ ἐν τῷ λογίζεσθαι εἴπερ που ἄλλοθι κατάδηλον αὐτῇ γίγνεταί τι τῶν ὄντων;
Yes. And thought is best when the mind is gathered into herself and none of these things trouble her-
Ναί. Λογίζεται δέ γέ που τότε κάλλιστα͵ ὅταν αὐτὴν τούτων μηδὲν παραλυπῇ͵
neither sounds nor sights nor pain nor any pleasure-
 μήτε ἀκοὴ μήτε ὄψις μήτε ἀλγηδὼν μηδέ τις ἡδονή͵
when she has as little as possible to do with the body, and has no bodily sense or feeling, but is aspiring after being?
ἀλλ΄ ὅτι μάλιστα αὐτὴ καθ΄ αὑτὴν γίγνηται ἐῶσα χαίρειν τὸ σῶμα͵ καὶ καθ΄ ὅσον δύναται μὴ κοινωνοῦσα αὐτῷ μηδ΄ ἁπτομένη ὀρέγηται τοῦ ὄντος.
That is true. And in this the philosopher dishonors the body;
Ἔστι ταῦτα. Οὐκοῦν καὶ ἐνταῦθα ἡ τοῦ φιλοσόφου

# 65d
[pl.phaedo.65d](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0170:text=Phaedo:section=65d)
his soul runs away from the body and desires to be alone and by herself?
 ψυχὴ μάλιστα ἀτιμάζει τὸ σῶμα καὶ φεύγει ἀπ΄ αὐτοῦ͵ ζητεῖ δὲ αὐτὴ καθ΄ αὑτὴν γίγνεσθαι;
That is true. Well, but there is another thing, Simmias:
Φαίνεται. Τί δὲ δὴ τὰ τοιάδε͵ ὦ Σιμμία;
Is there or is there not an absolute justice? Assuredly there is.
φαμέν τι εἶναι δίκαιον αὐτὸ ἢ οὐδέν; Φαμὲν μέντοι νὴ Δία.
And an absolute beauty and absolute good? Of course. 
Καὶ αὖ καλόν γέ τι καὶ ἀγαθόν; Πῶς δ΄ οὔ;
But did you ever behold any of them with your eyes? Certainly not.
῎Ηδη οὖν πώποτέ τι τῶν τοιούτων τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς εἶδες; Οὐδαμῶς͵
Or did you ever reach them with any other bodily sense?
 ἦ δ΄ ὅς. Ἀλλ΄ ἄλλῃ τινὶ αἰσθήσει τῶν διὰ τοῦ σώματος ἐφήψω αὐτῶν;
(and I speak not of these alone, but of absolute greatness, and health, and strength, and of the essence or true nature of everything).
λέγω δὲ περὶ πάντων͵ οἷον μεγέθους πέρι͵ ὑγιείας͵ ἰσχύος͵ καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ἑνὶ λόγῳ ἁπάντων τῆς οὐσίας ὃ τυγχάνει ἕκαστον ὄν· 

# 65e
[pl.phaedo.65e](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0170:text=Phaedo:section=65e)
Has the reality of them ever been perceived by you through the bodily organs? 
ἆρα διὰ τοῦ σώματος αὐτῶν τὸ ἀληθέστατον θεωρεῖται͵ ἢ ὧδε ἔχει· 
or rather, is not the nearest approach to the knowledge of their several natures made by him who so orders his intellectual vision as to have the most exact conception of the essence of that which he considers?
ὃς ἂν μάλιστα ἡμῶν καὶ ἀκριβέστατα παρασκευάσηται αὐτὸ ἕκαστον διανοηθῆναι περὶ οὗ σκοπεῖ͵ οὗτος ἂν ἐγγύτατα ἴοι τοῦ γνῶναι ἕκαστον;
Certainly.                                                
Πάνυ μὲν οὖν.
And he attains to the knowledge of them in their highest purity who goes to each of them with the mind alone,
Ἆρ΄ οὖν ἐκεῖνος ἂν τοῦτο ποιήσειεν καθαρώτατα ὅστις ὅτι μάλιστα αὐτῇ τῇ διανοίᾳ ἴοι ἐφ΄ ἕκαστον͵

# 66a
[pl.phaedo.66a](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0170:text=Phaedo:section=66a)
not allowing when in the act of thought the intrusion or introduction of sight or any other sense in the company of reason,
μήτε τιν΄ ὄψιν παρατιθέμενος ἐν τῷ διανοεῖσθαι μήτε [τινὰ] ἄλλην αἴσθησιν ἐφέλκων μηδεμίαν μετὰ τοῦ λογισμοῦ͵
but with the very light of the mind in her clearness penetrates into the very fight of truth in each;
ἀλλ΄ αὐτῇ καθ΄ αὑτὴν εἰλικρινεῖ τῇ διανοίᾳ χρώμενος αὐτὸ καθ΄ αὑτὸ εἰλικρινὲς ἕκαστον ἐπιχειροῖ θηρεύειν τῶν ὄντων͵
he has got rid, as far as he can, of eyes and ears and of the whole body,
ἀπαλλαγεὶς ὅτι μάλιστα ὀφθαλμῶν τε καὶ ὤτων καὶ ὡς ἔπος εἰπεῖν σύμπαντος τοῦ σώματος͵
which he conceives of only as a disturbing element, hindering the soul from the acquisition of knowledge when in company with her-
ὡς ταράττοντος καὶ οὐκ ἐῶντος τὴν ψυχὴν κτήσασθαι ἀλήθειάν τε καὶ φρόνησιν ὅταν κοινωνῇ;
is not this the sort of man who, if ever man did, is likely to attain the knowledge of existence?
ἆρ΄ οὐχ οὗτός ἐστιν͵ ὦ Σιμμία͵ εἴπερ τις [καὶ] ἄλλος ὁ τευξόμενος τοῦ ὄντος;
There is admirable truth in that, Socrates, replied Simmias.  Ὑπερφυῶς͵ ἔφη ὁ Σιμμίας͵ ὡς ἀληθῆ λέγεις͵ ὦ Σώκρατες.  

# 66b
[pl.phaedo.66b](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0170:text=Phaedo:section=66b)
And when they consider all this,       
Οὐκοῦν ἀνάγκη͵ ἔφη͵ ἐκ πάντων τούτων παρίστασθαι 
must not true philosophers make a reflection,
δόξαν τοιάνδε τινὰ τοῖς γνησίως φιλοσόφοις͵ 
of which they will speak to one another in such words as these:
ὥστε καὶ πρὸς ἀλλήλους τοιαῦτα ἄττα λέγειν͵ ὅτι
We have found, they will say, a path of speculation which seems to bring us and the argument to the conclusion that 
Κινδυνεύει τοι ὥσπερ ἀτραπός τις ἐκφέρειν ἡμᾶς [μετὰ τοῦ λόγου ἐν τῇ σκέψει]͵ ὅτι͵ 
while we are in the body,                    
ἕως ἂν τὸ σῶμα ἔχωμεν  
and while the soul is mingled with this mass of evil,
καὶ συμπεφυρμένη ᾖ ἡμῶν ἡ ψυχὴ μετὰ τοιούτου κακοῦ͵
our desire will not be satisfied,          
οὐ μή ποτε κτησώμεθα ἱκανῶς οὗ ἐπιθυμοῦμεν·
and our desire is of the truth.             
φαμὲν δὲ τοῦτο εἶναι τὸ ἀληθές.
For the body is a source of endless trouble to us 
μυρίας μὲν γὰρ ἡμῖν ἀσχολίας παρέχει τὸ σῶμα 
by reason of the mere requirement of food;
διὰ τὴν ἀναγκαίαν τροφήν·

# 66c
[pl.phaedo.66c](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0170:text=Phaedo:section=66c)
and also is liable to diseases which overtake and impede us in the search after truth:
ἔτι δέ͵ ἄν τινες νόσοι προσπέσωσιν͵ ἐμποδίζουσιν ἡμῶν τὴν τοῦ ὄντος θήραν.
and by filling us so full of loves, and lusts, and fears, and fancies, and idols, and every sort of folly,    ἐρώτων δὲ καὶ ἐπιθυμιῶν καὶ φόβων καὶ εἰδώλων παντοδαπῶν καὶ φλυαρίας ἐμπίμπλησιν ἡμᾶς πολλῆς͵   
prevents our ever having, as people say, so much as a thought.
ὥστε τὸ λεγόμενον ὡς ἀληθῶς τῷ ὄντι ὑπ΄ αὐτοῦ οὐδὲ φρονῆσαι ἡμῖν ἐγγίγνεται οὐδέποτε οὐδέν. 
For whence come wars, and fightings, and factions? whence but from the body and the lusts of the body? 
καὶ γὰρ πολέμους καὶ στάσεις καὶ μάχας οὐδὲν ἄλλο παρέχει ἢ τὸ σῶμα καὶ αἱ τούτου ἐπιθυμίαι. 
For wars are occasioned by the love of money, 
διὰ γὰρ τὴν τῶν χρημάτων κτῆσιν πάντες οἱ πόλεμοι γίγνονται͵ 

# 66d
[pl.phaedo.66d](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0170:text=Phaedo:section=66d)
and money has to be acquired for the sake and in the service of the body;
τὰ δὲ χρήματα ἀναγκαζόμεθα κτᾶσθαι διὰ τὸ σῶμα͵ δουλεύοντες τῇ τούτου θεραπείᾳ·
and in consequence of all these things the time which ought to be given to philosophy is lost. 
καὶ ἐκ τούτου ἀσχολίαν ἄγομεν φιλοσοφίας πέρι διὰ πάντα ταῦτα. 
Moreover, if there is time and an inclination toward philosophy, 
τὸ δ΄ ἔσχατον πάντων ὅτι͵ ἐάν τις ἡμῖν καὶ σχολὴ γένηται ἀπ΄ αὐτοῦ καὶ τραπώμεθα πρὸς τὸ σκοπεῖν τι͵ 
yet the body introduces a turmoil and confusion and fear into the course of speculation, 
ἐν ταῖς ζητήσεσιν αὖ πανταχοῦ παραπῖπτον θόρυβον παρέχει καὶ ταραχὴν καὶ ἐκπλήττει͵ 
and hinders us from seeing the truth: 
ὥστε μὴ δύνασθαι ὑπ΄ αὐτοῦ καθορᾶν τἀληθές. 
and all experience shows that if we would have pure knowledge of anything we must be quit of the body,  
ἀλλὰ τῷ ὄντι ἡμῖν δέδεικται ὅτι͵ εἰ μέλλομέν ποτε καθαρῶς τι εἴσεσθαι͵ 

# 66e
[pl.phaedo.66e](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0170:text=Phaedo:section=66e)
and the soul in herself must behold all things in themselves:
ἀπαλλακτέον αὐτοῦ καὶ αὐτῇ τῇ ψυχῇ θεατέον αὐτὰ τὰ πράγματα· 
then I suppose that we shall attain that which we desire, 
καὶ τότε͵ ὡς ἔοικεν͵ ἡμῖν ἔσται οὗ ἐπιθυμοῦμέν τε 
and of which we say that we are lovers, 
καί φαμεν ἐρασταὶ εἶναι͵ 
and that is wisdom,                              
φρονήσεως͵ 
not while we live, but after death, as the argument shows; 
ἐπειδὰν τελευτήσωμεν͵ ὡς ὁ λόγος σημαίνει͵ ζῶσιν δὲ οὔ. 
for if while in company with the body the soul cannot have pure knowledge,
εἰ γὰρ μὴ οἷόν τε μετὰ τοῦ σώματος μηδὲν καθαρῶς γνῶναι͵
one of two things seems to follow-    
 δυοῖν θάτερον͵ 
either knowledge is not to be attained at all, or, if at all, after death.
ἢ οὐδαμοῦ ἔστιν κτήσασθαι τὸ εἰδέναι ἢ τελευτήσασιν· 

# 67a
[pl.phaedo.67a](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0170:text=Phaedo:section=67a)
For then, and not till then, the soul will be in herself alone and without the body. 
τότε γὰρ αὐτὴ καθ΄ αὑτὴν ἡ ψυχὴ ἔσται χωρὶς τοῦ σώματος͵ πρότερον δ΄ οὔ. 
In this present life,                               
καὶ ἐν ᾧ ἂν ζῶμεν͵ 
I reckon that we make the nearest approach to knowledge 
οὕτως͵ ὡς ἔοικεν͵ ἐγγυτάτω ἐσόμεθα τοῦ εἰδέναι͵ 
when we have the least possible concern or interest in the body,
ἐὰν ὅτι μάλιστα μηδὲν ὁμιλῶμεν τῷ σώματι μηδὲ κοινωνῶμεν͵ ὅτι μὴ πᾶσα ἀνάγκη͵ 
and are not saturated with the bodily nature, 
μηδὲ ἀναπιμπλώμεθα τῆς τούτου φύσεως͵ 
but remain pure                                    
ἀλλὰ καθαρεύωμεν ἀπ΄ αὐτοῦ͵   
until the hour when God himself is pleased to release us. 
ἕως ἂν ὁ θεὸς αὐτὸς ἀπολύσῃ ἡμᾶς· 
And then the foolishness of the body will be cleared away  
καὶ οὕτω μὲν καθαροὶ ἀπαλλαττόμενοι τῆς τοῦ σώματος ἀφροσύνης͵ 
and we shall be pure and hold converse with other pure souls,
ὡς τὸ εἰκὸς μετὰ τοιούτων τε ἐσόμεθα 
and know of ourselves the clear light everywhere; 
καὶ γνωσόμεθα δι΄ ἡμῶν αὐτῶν πᾶν τὸ εἰλικρινές͵    

# 67b
[pl.phaedo.67b](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0170:text=Phaedo:section=67b)
and this is surely the light of truth.   
τοῦτο δ΄ ἐστὶν ἴσως τὸ ἀληθές· 
For no impure thing is allowed to approach the pure. 
μὴ καθαρῷ γὰρ καθαροῦ ἐφάπτεσθαι μὴ οὐ θεμιτὸν ᾖ. 
These are the sort of words, Simmias, 
τοιαῦτα οἶμαι͵ ὦ Σιμμία͵ 
which the true lovers of wisdom cannot help saying to one another, and thinking. 
ἀναγκαῖον εἶναι πρὸς ἀλλήλους λέγειν τε καὶ δοξάζειν πάντας τοὺς ὀρθῶς φιλομαθεῖς. 
You will agree with me in that?         
ἢ οὐ δοκεῖ σοι οὕτως;
Certainly, Socrates.                               
Παντός γε μᾶλλον͵ ὦ Σώκρατες. 
But if this is true, O my friend,           
Οὐκοῦν͵ ἔφη ὁ Σωκράτης͵ εἰ ταῦτα ἀληθῆ͵ ὦ ἑταῖρε͵
then there is great hope that, going whither I go, 
πολλὴ ἐλπὶς ἀφικομένῳ οἷ ἐγὼ πορεύομαι͵
I shall there be satisfied with that which has been the chief concern of you and me in our past lives.
ἐκεῖ ἱκανῶς͵ εἴπερ που ἄλλοθι͵ κτήσασθαι τοῦτο οὗ ἕνεκα ἡ πολλὴ πραγματεία ἡμῖν ἐν τῷ παρελθόντι βίῳ γέγονεν͵

[pl.phaedo.67c](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0170:text=Phaedo:section=67c)
And now that the hour of departure is appointed to me, this is the hope with which I depart, and not I only,
ὥστε ἥ γε ἀποδημία ἡ νῦν μοι προστεταγμένη μετὰ ἀγαθῆς ἐλπίδος γίγνεται 
but every man who believes that he has his mind purified.
καὶ ἄλλῳ ἀνδρὶ ὃς ἡγεῖταί οἱ παρεσκευάσθαι τὴν διάνοιαν ὥσπερ κεκαθαρμένην.
Certainly, replied Simmias.                 
Πάνυ μὲν οὖν͵ ἔφη ὁ Σιμμίας. 
And what is purification but the separation of the soul from the body, as I was saying before; 
Κάθαρσις δὲ εἶναι ἆρα οὐ τοῦτο συμβαίνει͵ ὅπερ πάλαι ἐν τῷ λόγῳ λέγεται͵ τὸ χωρίζειν ὅτι μάλιστα ἀπὸ τοῦ σώματος τὴν ψυχὴν 
the habit of the soul gathering and collecting herself into herself, out of all the courses of the body; 
καὶ ἐθίσαι αὐτὴν καθ΄ αὑτὴν πανταχόθεν ἐκ τοῦ σώματος συναγείρεσθαί τε καὶ ἁθροίζεσθαι͵ 
the dwelling in her own place alone, as in another life, so also in this, as far as she can;

καὶ οἰκεῖν κατὰ τὸ δυνατὸν καὶ ἐν τῷ νῦν παρόντι καὶ ἐν τῷ ἔπειτα μόνην καθ΄ αὑτήν͵ 
the release of the soul from the chains of the body?
ἐκλυομένην ὥσπερ [ἐκ] δεσμῶν ἐκ τοῦ σώματος;
Very true, he said.                                 
Πάνυ μὲν οὖν͵ ἔφη.

[pl.phaedo.79e](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0170:text=Phaedo:section=79e)
Yet once more consider the matter in this light: 
Ὅρα δὴ καὶ τῇδε   
When the soul and the body are united, 
ὅτι ἐπειδὰν ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ ὦσι ψυχὴ καὶ σῶμα͵ 
# 80a
[pl.phaedo.80a](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0170:text=Phaedo:section=80a)
then nature orders the soul to rule and govern, 
τῷ μὲν δουλεύειν καὶ ἄρχεσθαι ἡ φύσις προστάττει͵ 
and the body to obey and serve.        
τῇ δὲ ἄρχειν καὶ δεσπόζειν·
Now which of these two functions is akin to the divine?
καὶ κατὰ ταῦτα αὖ πότερόν σοι δοκεῖ ὅμοιον τῷ θείῳ εἶναι
and which to the mortal?                    
καὶ πότερον τῷ θνητῷ;
Does not the divine appear to you to be 
ἢ οὐ δοκεῖ σοι τὸ μὲν θεῖον 
that which naturally orders and rules,
οἷον ἄρχειν τε καὶ ἡγεμονεύειν πεφυκέναι͵
and the mortal that which is subject and servant?
τὸ δὲ θνητὸν ἄρχεσθαί τε καὶ δουλεύειν;
True.                                                        
Ἔμοιγε.
And which does the soul resemble?  
Ποτέρῳ οὖν ἡ ψυχὴ ἔοικεν;
there can be no doubt of that, Socrates -
Δῆλα δή͵ ὦ Σώκρατες͵
The soul resembles the divine            
ὅτι ἡ μὲν ψυχὴ τῷ θείῳ͵ 
and the body the mortal-. (...)             
τὸ δὲ σῶμα τῷ θνητῷ. (...)

[pl.phaedo.80d](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0170:text=Phaedo:section=80d)
And are we to suppose that                
the soul, which is invisible, in passing to the true Hades, which like her is invisible, and pure, and noble,
Ἡ δὲ ψυχὴ ἄρα͵ τὸ ἀιδές͵ τὸ εἰς τοιοῦτον τόπον ἕτερον οἰχόμενον γενναῖον καὶ καθαρὸν καὶ ἀιδῆ͵ εἰς Ἅιδου ὡς ἀληθῶς͵
and on her way to the good and wise God,
παρὰ τὸν ἀγαθὸν καὶ φρόνιμον θεόν͵
whither, if God will, my soul is also soon to go-
οἷ͵ ἂν θεὸς θέλῃ͵ αὐτίκα καὶ τῇ ἐμῇ ψυχῇ ἰτέον͵ 
that the soul, I repeat, if this be her nature and origin, 
αὕτη δὲ δὴ ἡμῖν ἡ τοιαύτη καὶ οὕτω πεφυκυῖα 
is blown away and perishes immediately on quitting the body 
ἀπαλλαττομένη τοῦ σώματος εὐθὺς διαπεφύσηται καὶ ἀπόλωλεν͵

[pl.phaedo.80e](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0170:text=Phaedo:section=80e)
That can never be,                                
πολλοῦ γε δεῖ͵ 
dear Simmias and Cebes.                     
ὦ φίλε Κέβης τε καὶ Σιμμία͵
The truth rather is that                        
ἀλλὰ πολλῷ μᾶλλον ὧδ΄ ἔχει·   
the soul which is pure at departing   
ἐὰν μὲν καθαρὰ ἀπαλλάττηται͵
draws after her no bodily taint,         
μηδὲν τοῦ σώματος συνεφέλκουσα͵
having never voluntarily had connection with the body,
ἅτε οὐδὲν κοινωνοῦσα αὐτῷ ἐν τῷ βίῳ ἑκοῦσα εἶναι͵ 
which she is ever avoiding,                
ἀλλὰ φεύγουσα αὐτὸ
herself gathered into herself              
καὶ συνηθροισμένη αὐτὴ εἰς ἑαυτήν͵ 
(for such abstraction has been the study of her life).
greek
And what does this mean but that she has been a true disciple of philosophy
ἅτε μελετῶσα ἀεὶ τοῦτο τὸ δὲ οὐδὲν ἄλλο ἐστὶν ἢ ὀρθῶς φιλοσοφοῦσα 

# 81a
[pl.phaedo.81a](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0170:text=Phaedo:section=81a)
and has practised how to die easily?
καὶ τῷ ὄντι τεθνάναι μελετῶσα ῥᾳδίως·
And is not philosophy the practice of death?
ἢ οὐ τοῦτ΄ ἂν εἴη μελέτη θανάτου;
Certainly.                                                
Παντάπασί γε. 
That soul, I say, herself invisible, departs to the invisible world 
Οὐκοῦν οὕτω μὲν ἔχουσα εἰς τὸ ὅμοιον αὐτῇ τὸ ἀιδὲς ἀπέρχεται͵ 
to the divine and immortal and rational: 
τὸ θεῖόν τε καὶ ἀθάνατον καὶ φρόνιμον͵ 
thither arriving, she lives in bliss      
οἷ ἀφικομένῃ ὑπάρχει αὐτῇ εὐδαίμονι εἶναι͵ 
and is released from the error and folly of men, their fears and wild passions and all other human ills, 
πλάνης καὶ ἀνοίας καὶ φόβων καὶ ἀγρίων ἐρώτων καὶ τῶν ἄλλων κακῶν τῶν ἀνθρωπείων ἀπηλλαγμένῃ͵ 
and as they say of the initiated,         
 ὥσπερ δὲ λέγεται κατὰ τῶν μεμυημένων͵
forever dwells in company with the gods. 
ὡς ἀληθῶς τὸν λοιπὸν χρόνον μετὰ θεῶν διάγουσα; 
Is not this true, Cebes?                         
οὕτω φῶμεν͵ ὦ Κέβης͵ ἢ ἄλλως;
Yes, said Cebes, beyond a doubt.        
Οὕτω νὴ Δία͵ ἔφη ὁ Κέβης.

But the soul which has been polluted, 
Ἐὰν δέ γε οἶμαι μεμιασμένη
and is impure at the time of her departure,
καὶ ἀκάθαρτος τοῦ σώματος ἀπαλλάττηται͵
and is the companion and servant of the body always,
ἅτε τῷ σώματι ἀεὶ συνοῦσα καὶ τοῦτο θεραπεύουσα 
and is in love with and fascinated by the body   καὶ ἐρῶσα καὶ γοητευομένη ὑπ΄ αὐτοῦ 
and by the desires and pleasures of the body, 
ὑπό τε τῶν ἐπιθυμιῶν καὶ ἡδονῶν͵ 
until she is led to believe that the truth only exists in a bodily form, 
ὥστε μηδὲν ἄλλο δοκεῖν εἶναι ἀληθὲς ἀλλ΄ ἢ τὸ σωματοειδές͵ 
which a man may touch and see and taste and use for the purposes of his lusts-

the soul, which to the bodily eye is dark and invisible,    τὸ δὲ τοῖς ὄμμασι σκοτῶδες καὶ ἀιδές͵ 
and can be attained only by philosophy,

accustomed to hate and fear and avoid the intellectual principle -

do you suppose that such a soul as this will depart pure and unalloyed?
οὕτω δὴ ἔχουσαν οἴει ψυχὴν αὐτὴν καθ΄ αὑτὴν εἰλικρινῆ ἀπαλλάξεσθαι;
That is impossible, he replied.            
Οὐδ΄ ὁπωστιοῦν͵ ἔφη. 
She is engrossed by the corporeal,    
Ἀλλὰ [καὶ] διειλημμένην γε οἶμαι ὑπὸ τοῦ σωματοειδοῦς͵ 
which the continual association and constant care of the body have made natural to her.
ὃ αὐτῇ ἡ ὁμιλία τε καὶ συνουσία τοῦ σώματος διὰ τὸ ἀεὶ συνεῖναι καὶ διὰ τὴν πολλὴν μελέτην ἐνεποίησε σύμφυτον;
Very true.                                               
Πάνυ γε.
And this, my friend, may be conceived to be that heavy, weighty, earthy element of sight
Ἐμβριθὲς δέ γε͵ ὦ φίλε͵ τοῦτο οἴεσθαι χρὴ εἶναι καὶ βαρὺ καὶ γεῶδες καὶ ὁρατόν·
by which such a soul is depressed and dragged down again into the visible world,

because she is afraid of the invisible and of the world below-

prowling about tombs and sepulchres, 
περὶ τὰ μνήματά τε καὶ τοὺς τάφους κυλινδουμένη͵ 
in the neighborhood of which, are seen certain ghostly apparitions of souls 
περὶ ἃ δὴ καὶ ὤφθη ἄττα ψυχῶν σκιοειδῆ φαντάσματα͵ οἷα παρέχονται αἱ τοιαῦται ψυχαὶ εἴδωλα͵ 
which have not departed pure,          
αἱ μὴ καθαρῶς ἀπολυθεῖσαι 
but are cloyed with sight                     
ἀλλὰ τοῦ ὁρατοῦ μετέχουσαι͵ 
and therefore visible.

That is very likely, Socrates.               
Εἰκός γε͵ ὦ Σώκρατες. 
Yes, that is very likely, Cebes;             
Εἰκὸς μέντοι͵ ὦ Κέβης· 
and these must be the souls, not of the good, 
καὶ οὔ τί γε τὰς τῶν ἀγαθῶν αὐτὰς εἶναι͵ 
but of the evil,                                       
ἀλλὰ τὰς τῶν φαύλων͵ 
who are compelled to wander about such places

in payment of the penalty of their former evil way of life;

ἕως ἂν τῇ τοῦ συνεπακολουθοῦντος͵ τοῦ σωματοειδοῦς͵ 
until the desire which haunts them is satisfied.

And they may be supposed to be fixed in the same natures which they had in their former life.

What natures do you mean, Socrates?
Τὰ ποῖα δὴ ταῦτα λέγεις͵ ὦ Σώκρατες;
I mean to say that men who have followed after gluttony, and wantonness, and drunkenness, 
Οἷον τοὺς μὲν γαστριμαργίας τε καὶ ὕβρεις καὶ φιλοποσίας

And those who have chosen the portion of injustice, and tyranny, and violence,

Yes, said Cebes;

εἰς τὰ τοιαῦτα. 
And there is no difficulty, he said, in assigning to all of them places answering to their several natures and propensities?

Κέβης δέ μοι ἔδοξε τοῦτο μὲν ἐμοὶ συγχωρεῖν, πολυχρονιώτερόν γε εἶναι ψυχὴν σώματος, ἀλλὰ τόδε ἄδηλον παντί, μὴ πολλὰ δὴ σώματα καὶ πολλάκις κατατρίψασα ἡ ψυχὴ τὸ τελευταῖον σῶμα καταλιποῦσα νῦν αὐτὴ ἀπολλύηται, καὶ ᾖ αὐτὸ τοῦτο θάνατος, ψυχῆς ὄλεθρος, ἐπεὶ σῶμά γε ἀεὶ ἀπολλύμενον οὐδὲν παύεται. ἆρα ἄλλ᾽ ἢ ταῦτ᾽ ἐστίν, ὦ Σιμμία τε καὶ Κέβης, ἃ δεῖ ἡμᾶς ἐπισκοπεῖσθαι;

And, Cebes, I believe, granted that the soul is more lasting than the body, but said that no one could know that the soul, after wearing out many bodies, did not at last perish itself upon leaving the body; and that this was death—the destruction of the soul, since the body is continually being destroyed. Are those the points, Simmias and Cebes, which we must consider?”

“That is true,” said he.

Then whatever the soul possesses,    
Ψυχὴ ἄρα ὅτι ἂν αὐτὴ κατάσχῃ͵ 
to that she comes bearing life?           
ἀεὶ ἥκει ἐπ΄ ἐκεῖνο φέρουσα ζωήν; 
Yes, certainly.                                        
῞Ηκει μέντοι͵ ἔφη. 
And is there any opposite to life?      
Πότερον δ΄ ἔστι τι ζωῇ ἐναντίον ἢ οὐδέν; 
There is, he said.                                   
Ἔστιν͵ ἔφη. 
And what is that? Death.                     
Τί; Θάνατος. 
Then the soul, as has been acknowledged, will never receive the opposite of what she brings. 
Οὐκοῦν ψυχὴ τὸ ἐναντίον ᾧ αὐτὴ ἐπιφέρει ἀεὶ οὐ μή ποτε δέξηται͵ 
And now, he said, what did we call that principle which repels the even? The odd. 
ὡς ἐκ τῶν πρόσθεν ὡμολόγηται; Καὶ μάλα σφόδρα͵ ἔφη ὁ Κέβης. Τί οὖν; 
τὸ μὴ δεχόμενον τὴν τοῦ ἀρτίου ἰδέαν τί νυνδὴ ὠνομάζομεν; 
Ἀνάρτιον͵ ἔφη. 
 And that principle which repels the musical, or the just? 
Τὸ δὲ δίκαιον μὴ δεχόμενον καὶ ὃ ἂν μουσικὸν μὴ δέχηται; 
 The unmusical, he said, and the unjust. 
Ἄμουσον͵ ἔφη͵ τὸ δὲ ἄδικον. Εἶεν· 
And what do we call the principle which does not admit of death?
ὃ δ΄ ἂν θάνατον μὴ δέχηται τί καλοῦμεν; 
The immortal, he said.                         
Ἀθάνατον͵ ἔφη. 
And does the soul admit of death? No. 
Οὐκοῦν ψυχὴ οὐ δέχεται θάνατον; Οὔ. 
Then the soul is immortal?                 
Ἀθάνατον ἄρα ψυχή.
Yes, he said.                                           
Ἀθάνατον.

BUT THEN, O my friends, he said,     
Ἀλλὰ τόδε γ΄͵ ἔφη͵ ὦ ἄνδρες͵ 
if the soul is really immortal, what care should be taken of her, 
δίκαιον διανοηθῆναι͵ ὅτι͵ εἴπερ ἡ ψυχὴ ἀθάνατος͵ ἐπιμελείας δὴ δεῖται 
not only in respect of the portion of time which is called life, 
οὐχ ὑπὲρ τοῦ χρόνου τούτου μόνον ἐν ᾧ καλοῦμεν τὸ ζῆν͵ 
but of eternity!                                      
ἀλλ΄ ὑπὲρ τοῦ παντός͵ 
And the danger of neglecting her from this point of view does indeed appear to be awful. 
καὶ ὁ κίνδυνος νῦν δὴ καὶ δόξειεν ἂν δεινὸς εἶναι͵ εἴ τις αὐτῆς ἀμελήσει. 
If death had only been the end of all, 
εἰ μὲν γὰρ ἦν ὁ θάνατος τοῦ παντὸς ἀπαλλαγή͵ 
the wicked would have had a good bargain in dying, 
ἕρμαιον ἂν ἦν τοῖς κακοῖς ἀποθανοῦσι 
for they would have been happily quit not only of their body, but of their own evil together with their souls. 
τοῦ τε σώματος ἅμ΄ ἀπηλλάχθαι καὶ τῆς αὑτῶν κακίας μετὰ τῆς ψυχῆς· 
But now, as the soul plainly appears to be immortal,

there is no release or salvation from evil 
οὐδεμία ἂν εἴη αὐτῇ ἄλλη ἀποφυγὴ κακῶν οὐδὲ σωτηρία 
except the attainment of the highest virtue and wisdom. 
πλὴν τοῦ ὡς βελτίστην τε καὶ φρονιμωτάτην γενέσθαι. 
For the soul when on her progress to the world below 
οὐδὲν γὰρ ἄλλο ἔχουσα εἰς Ἅιδου ἡ ψυχὴ 
takes nothing with her but nurture and education; 
ἔρχεται πλὴν τῆς παιδείας τε καὶ τροφῆς͵ 
which are indeed said greatly to benefit or greatly to injure the departed,

following the guide who is appointed to conduct them from this world to the other:

Now this journey to the other world is not, as Aeschylus says in the "Telephus," a single and straight path-
ἔστι δὲ ἄρα ἡ πορεία οὐχ ὡς ὁ Αἰσχύλου Τήλεφος λέγει· ἐκεῖνος μὲν γὰρ ἁπλῆν οἶμόν φησιν εἰς Ἅιδου φέρειν͵ 
as I must infer                                       
ἡ δ΄ οὔτε ἁπλῆ οὔτε μία φαίνεταί μοι εἶναι. 
no guide would be wanted for that,  
οὐδὲ γὰρ ἂν ἡγεμόνων ἔδει· 
and no one could miss a single path;
οὐ γάρ πού τις ἂν διαμάρτοι οὐδαμόσε μιᾶς ὁδοῦ οὔσης. 
but there are many partings of the road, and windings, from the rites and sacrifices which are offered to the gods below in places where three ways meet on earth.
νῦν δὲ ἔοικε σχίσεις τε καὶ τριόδους πολλὰς ἔχειν· ἀπὸ τῶν θυσιῶν τε καὶ νομίμων τῶν ἐνθάδε τεκμαιρόμενος λέγω.
The wise and orderly soul is conscious of her situation and follows in the path;
ἡ μὲν οὖν κοσμία τε καὶ φρόνιμος ψυχὴ ἕπεταί τε καὶ οὐκ ἀγνοεῖ τὰ παρόντα· 
but the soul which desires the body,   ἡ δ΄ ἐπιθυμητικῶς τοῦ σώματος ἔχουσα͵

and when she arrives at the place where the other souls are gathered,

if she be impure and have done impure deeds,

or been concerned in foul murders or other crimes

which are the brothers of these, and the works of brothers in crime-

until certain times are fulfilled,         
ἕως ἂν δή τινες χρόνοι γένωνται͵

she is borne irresistibly to her own fitting habitation;

in the company and under the guidance of the gods

Now the earth has divers wonderful regions,

and is indeed in nature and extent very unlike the notions of geographers, 
καὶ αὐτὴ οὔτε οἵα οὔτε ὅση δοξάζεται ὑπὸ τῶν περὶ γῆς εἰωθότων λέγειν͵

and inhabit a small portion only, and that many others dwell in many like places. 
καὶ ἄλλους ἄλλοθι πολλοὺς ἐν πολλοῖσι τοιούτοις τόποις οἰκεῖν. 
For I should say that in all parts of the earth there are hollows of various forms and sizes, 
εἶναι γὰρ πανταχῇ περὶ τὴν γῆν πολλὰ κοῖλα καὶ παντοδαπὰ καὶ τὰς ἰδέας καὶ τὰ μεγέθη͵ 
into which the water and the mist and the air collect; 
εἰς ἃ συνερρυηκέναι τό τε ὕδωρ καὶ τὴν ὁμίχλην καὶ τὸν ἀέρα· 
and that the true earth is pure and in the pure heaven,

[pl.phaedo.109c](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0170:text=Phaedo:section=109c)
that is the heaven which is commonly spoken of as the ether, 
ὃν δὴ αἰθέρα ὀνομάζειν τοὺς πολλοὺς τῶν περὶ τὰ τοιαῦτα εἰωθότων λέγειν· 
of which this is but the sediment collecting in the hollows of the earth. 
οὗ δὴ ὑποστάθμην ταῦτα εἶναι καὶ συρρεῖν ἀεὶ εἰς τὰ κοῖλα τῆς γῆς. 
But we who live in these hollows      
ἡμᾶς οὖν οἰκοῦντας ἐν τοῖς κοίλοις 
are deceived into the notion that we are dwelling above on the surface of the earth; 
αὐτῆς λεληθέναι καὶ οἴεσθαι ἄνω ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς οἰκεῖν͵ 
which is just as if a creature who was at the bottom of the sea 
ὥσπερ ἂν εἴ τις ἐν μέσῳ τῷ πυθμένι τοῦ πελάγους οἰκῶν 
were to fancy that he was on the surface of the water, 
οἴοιτό τε ἐπὶ τῆς θαλάττης οἰκεῖν

 διὰ δὲ βραδυτῆτά τε καὶ ἀσθένειαν μηδεπώποτε ἐπὶ τὰ ἄκρα τῆς θαλάττης ἀφιγμένος 
and having never lifted up his head and seen this region 
μηδὲ ἑωρακὼς εἴη͵ἐκδὺς καὶ ἀνακύψας ἐκ τῆς θαλάττης εἰς τὸν ἐνθάδε τόπον͵ 
which is so much purer and fairer than his own,

nor ever heard from one who had seen.
μηδὲ ἄλλου ἀκηκοὼς εἴη τοῦ ἑωρακότος.
Now this is exactly our case:              
ταὐτὸν δὴ τοῦτο καὶ ἡμᾶς πεπονθέναι· 
for we are dwelling in a hollow of the earth, 
οἰκοῦντας γὰρ ἔν τινι κοίλῳ τῆς γῆς 
and fancy that we are on the surface; 
οἴεσθαι ἐπάνω αὐτῆς οἰκεῖν͵ 
and the air we call the heaven,

and in this we imagine that the stars move.

τὸ δὲ εἶναι ταὐ τόν͵ ὑπ΄ ἀσθενείας καὶ βραδυτῆτος 
which prevent our reaching the surface of the air: 
οὐχ οἵους τε εἶναι ἡμᾶς διεξελθεῖν ἐπ΄ ἔσχατον τὸν ἀέρα· 
for if any man could arrive at the exterior limit,

In the first place, the earth, when looked at from above, 
πρῶτον μὲν εἶναι τοιαύτη ἡ γῆ αὐτὴ ἰδεῖν͵ εἴ τις ἄνωθεν θεῷτο͵ 
is like one of those balls which have leather coverings in twelve pieces, and is of divers colors, 
ὥσπερ αἱ δωδεκάσκυτοι σφαῖραι͵ ποικίλη͵ χρώμασιν διειλημμένη͵

and they are visible to sight and large and abundant and found in every region of the earth, 
ἐκφανῆ γὰρ αὐτὰ πεφυκέναι͵ ὄντα πολλὰ πλήθει καὶ μεγάλα καὶ πανταχοῦ τῆς γῆς͵ 
and blessed is he who sees them.      
ὥστε αὐτὴν ἰδεῖν εἶναι θέαμα εὐδαιμόνων θεατῶν. 
And upon the earth are animals and men, 
ζῷα δ΄ ἐπ΄ αὐτῇ εἶναι ἄλλα τε πολλὰ καὶ ἀνθρώπους͵ 
some in a middle region,                     
τοὺς μὲν ἐν μεσογαίᾳ οἰκοῦντας͵   
others dwelling about the air as we dwell about the sea; 
τοὺς δὲ περὶ τὸν ἀέρα ὥσπερ ἡμεῖς περὶ τὴν θάλατταν͵ 
others in islands which the air flows round, near the continent: 
τοὺς δ΄ ἐν νήσοις ἃς περιρρεῖν τὸν ἀέρα πρὸς τῇ ἠπείρῳ οὔσας· 
and in a word, the air is used by them as the water and the sea are by us, 
καὶ ἑνὶ λόγῳ͵ ὅπερ ἡμῖν τὸ ὕδωρ τε καὶ ἡ θάλαττά ἐστι πρὸς τὴν ἡμετέραν χρείαν͵ τοῦτο ἐκεῖ τὸν ἀέρα͵

[pl.phaedo.111b](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0170:text=Phaedo:section=111b)
and the ether is to them what the air is to us.
ὃ δὲ ἡμῖν ἀήρ͵ ἐκείνοις τὸν αἰθέρα.
Moreover, the temperament of their seasons is such that they have no disease, 
τὰς δὲ ὥρας αὐτοῖς κρᾶσιν ἔχειν τοιαύτην ὥστε ἐκείνους ἀνόσους εἶναι 
and live much longer than we do,     
καὶ χρόνον τε ζῆν πολὺ πλείω τῶν ἐνθάδε͵ 
and have sight and hearing and smell, and all the other senses, in far greater perfection, 
καὶ ὄψει καὶ ἀκοῇ καὶ φρονήσει καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς τοιούτοις ἡμῶν ἀφεστάναι τῇ αὐτῇ ἀποστάσει 
in the same degree that air is purer than water or the ether than air. 
ᾗπερ ἀήρ τε ὕδατος ἀφέστηκεν καὶ αἰθὴρ ἀέρος πρὸς καθαρότητα. 
Also they have temples and sacred places in which the gods really dwell,   καὶ δὴ καὶ θεῶν ἄλση τε καὶ ἱερὰ αὐτοῖς εἶναι͵ ἐν οἷς τῷ ὄντι οἰκητὰς θεοὺς εἶναι͵   
and they hear their voices and receive their answers, and are conscious of them 
καὶ φήμας τε καὶ μαντείας καὶ αἰσθήσεις τῶν θεῶν

[pl.phaedo.111c](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0170:text=Phaedo:section=111c)
and hold converse with them,            
καὶ τοιαύτας συνουσίας γίγνεσθαι αὐτοῖς πρὸς αὐτούς· 
and they see the sun, moon, and stars as they really are, 
καὶ τόν γε ἥλιον καὶ σελήνην καὶ ἄστρα ὁρᾶσθαι ὑπ΄ αὐτῶν οἷα τυγχάνει ὄντα͵ 
and their other blessedness is of a piece with this. 
καὶ τὴν ἄλλην εὐδαιμονίαν τούτων ἀκόλουθον εἶναι. 
Such is the nature of the whole earth, and of the things which are around the earth; 
Καὶ ὅλην μὲν δὴ τὴν γῆν οὕτω πεφυκέναι καὶ τὰ περὶ τὴν γῆν· 
and there are divers regions in the hollows on the face of the globe everywhere, 
τόπους δ΄ ἐν αὐτῇ εἶναι κατὰ τὰ ἔγκοιλα αὐτῆς κύκλῳ περὶ ὅλην πολλούς͵ 
some of them deeper and also wider than that which we inhabit, 
τοὺς μὲν βαθυτέρους καὶ ἀναπεπταμένους μᾶλλον ἢ ἐν ᾧ ἡμεῖς οἰκοῦμεν͵ 
others deeper and with a narrower opening than ours, 
τοὺς δὲ βαθυτέρους ὄντας τὸ χάσμα αὐτοὺς ἔλαττον ἔχειν τοῦ παρ΄ ἡμῖν τόπου͵

[pl.phaedo.111d](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0170:text=Phaedo:section=111d)
and some are shallower and wider;  
ἔστι δ΄ οὓς καὶ βραχυτέρους τῷ βάθει τοῦ ἐνθάδε εἶναι καὶ πλατυτέρους. 
all have numerous perforations, and passages broad and narrow in the interior of the earth, connecting them with one another; 
τούτους δὲ πάντας ὑπὸ γῆν εἰς ἀλλήλους συντετρῆσθαί τε πολλαχῇ καὶ κατὰ στενότερα καὶ εὐρύτερα καὶ διεξόδους ἔχειν͵ 
and there flows into and out of them, as into basins, a vast tide of water, 
ᾗ πολὺ μὲν ὕδωρ ῥεῖν ἐξ ἀλλήλων εἰς ἀλλήλους ὥσπερ εἰς κρατῆρας͵ 
and huge subterranean streams of perennial rivers, 
καὶ ἀενάων ποταμῶν ἀμήχανα μεγέθη ὑπὸ τὴν γῆν 
and springs hot and cold,                    
καὶ θερμῶν ὑδάτων καὶ ψυχρῶν͵ 
and a great fire, and great rivers of fire, 
πολὺ δὲ πῦρ καὶ πυρὸς μεγάλους ποταμούς͵ 
and streams of liquid mud, thin or thick 
πολλοὺς δὲ ὑγροῦ πηλοῦ καὶ καθαρωτέρου καὶ βορβορωδεστέρου͵ 

# 111e
[pl.phaedo.111e](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0170:text=Phaedo:section=111e)
(like the rivers of mud in Sicily, and the lava-streams which follow them), 
ὥσπερ ἐν Σικελίᾳ οἱ πρὸ τοῦ ῥύακος πηλοῦ ῥέοντες ποταμοὶ καὶ αὐτὸς ὁ ῥύαξ· 
and the regions about which they happen to flow are filled up with them.
ὧν δὴ καὶ ἑκάστους τοὺς τόπους πληροῦσθαι͵ ὡς ἂν ἑκάστοις τύχῃ ἑκάστοτε ἡ περιρροὴ γιγνομένη.
And there is a sort of swing in the interior of the earth which moves all this up and down. 
ταῦτα δὲ πάντα κινεῖν ἄνω καὶ κάτω ὥσπερ αἰώραν τινὰ ἐνοῦσαν ἐν τῇ γῇ· 
Now the swing is in this wise:            
ἔστι δὲ ἄρα αὕτη ἡ αἰώρα διὰ φύσιν τοιάνδε τινά. 

# 112a
[pl.phaedo.112a](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0170:text=Phaedo:section=112a)
There is a chasm which is the vastest of them all, and pierces right through the whole earth; 
ἕν τι τῶν χασμάτων τῆς γῆς ἄλλως τε μέγιστον τυγχάνει ὂν καὶ διαμπερὲς τετρημένον δι΄ ὅλης τῆς γῆς͵ 
this is that which Homer describes in the words, - 
τοῦτο ὅπερ Ὅμηρος εἶπε͵ λέγων 
"Far off, where is the inmost depth beneath the earth"; -   αὐτό τῆλε μάλ΄͵ ᾗχι βάθιστον ὑπὸ χθονός ἐστι βέρεθρον·   
and which he in other places, and many other poets, have called Tartarus. 
ὃ καὶ ἄλλοθι καὶ ἐκεῖνος καὶ ἄλλοι πολλοὶ τῶν ποιητῶν Τάρταρον κεκλήκασιν. 
And the swing is caused by the streams flowing into and out of this chasm, 
εἰς γὰρ τοῦτο τὸ χάσμα συρρέουσί τε πάντες οἱ ποταμοὶ καὶ ἐκ τούτου πάλιν ἐκρέουσιν· 
and they each have the nature of the soil through which they flow. 
γίγνονται δὲ ἕκαστοι τοιοῦτοι δι΄ οἵας ἂν καὶ τῆς γῆς ῥέωσιν. 

# 112b
[pl.phaedo.112b](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0170:text=Phaedo:section=112b)
And the reason why the streams are always flowing in and out is 
ἡ δὲ αἰτία ἐστὶν τοῦ ἐκρεῖν τε ἐντεῦθεν καὶ εἰσρεῖν πάντα τὰ ῥεύματα͵ 
that the watery element has no bed or bottom, 
ὅτι πυθμένα οὐκ ἔχει οὐδὲ βάσιν τὸ ὑγρὸν τοῦτο. 
and is surging and swinging up and down, 
αἰωρεῖται δὴ καὶ κυμαίνει ἄνω καὶ κάτω͵ 
and the surrounding wind and air do the same; 
καὶ ὁ ἀὴρ καὶ τὸ πνεῦμα τὸ περὶ αὐτὸ ταὐτὸν ποιεῖ· 
they follow the water up and down, hither and thither, over the earth-
συνέπεται γὰρ αὐτῷ καὶ ὅταν εἰς τὸ ἐπ΄ ἐκεῖνα τῆς γῆς ὁρμήσῃ καὶ ὅταν εἰς τὸ ἐπὶ τάδε͵ 
just as in respiring the air is always in process of inhalation and exhalation; 
καὶ ὥσπερ τῶν ἀναπνεόντων ἀεὶ ἐκπνεῖ τε καὶ ἀναπνεῖ ῥέον τὸ πνεῦμα͵ 
and the wind swinging with the water in and out produces fearful and irresistible blasts: 
οὕτω καὶ ἐκεῖ συναιωρούμενον τῷ ὑγρῷ τὸ πνεῦμα δεινούς τινας ἀνέμους καὶ ἀμηχάνους παρέχεται καὶ εἰσιὸν καὶ ἐξιόν. 

# 112c
[pl.phaedo.112c](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0170:text=Phaedo:section=112c)
when the waters retire with a rush into the lower parts of the earth, as they are called, 
ὅταν τε οὖν ὑποχωρήσῃ τὸ ὕδωρ εἰς τὸν τόπον τὸν δὴ κάτω καλούμενον͵ 
they flow through the earth into those regions, 
τοῖς κατ΄ ἐκεῖνα τὰ ῥεύματα [διὰ] τῆς γῆς εἰσρεῖ τε 
and fill them up as with the alternate motion of a pump, 
καὶ πληροῖ αὐτὰ ὥσπερ οἱ ἐπαντλοῦντες· 
and then when they leave those regions and rush back hither, they again fill the hollows here, 
ὅταν τε αὖ ἐκεῖθεν μὲν ἀπολίπῃ͵ δεῦρο δὲ ὁρμήσῃ͵ τὰ ἐνθάδε πληροῖ αὖθις͵ 
and when these are filled, flow through subterranean channels 
τὰ δὲ πληρωθέντα ῥεῖ διὰ τῶν ὀχετῶν καὶ διὰ τῆς γῆς͵ 
and find their way to their several places, 
καὶ εἰς τοὺς τόπους ἕκαστα ἀφικνούμενα͵ εἰς οὓς ἑκάστοις ὡδοποίηται͵ 
forming seas, and lakes, and rivers, and springs. 
θαλάττας τε καὶ λίμνας καὶ ποταμοὺς καὶ κρήνας ποιεῖ· 
Thence they again enter the earth,    
ἐντεῦθεν δὲ πάλιν δυόμενα κατὰ τῆς γῆς͵ 

# 112d
[pl.phaedo.112d](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0170:text=Phaedo:section=112d)
some of them making a long circuit into many lands, 
τὰ μὲν μακροτέρους τόπους περιελθόντα καὶ πλείους͵ 
others going to few places and those not distant, and again fall into Tartarus, 
τὰ δὲ ἐλάττους καὶ βραχυτέρους͵ πάλιν εἰς τὸν Τάρταρον ἐμβάλλει͵ 
some at a point a good deal lower than that at which they rose, and others not much lower, 
τὰ μὲν πολὺ κατωτέρω ἢ ᾗ ἐπηντλεῖτο͵ τὰ δὲ ὀλίγον· 
but all in some degree lower than the point of issue. 
πάντα δὲ ὑποκάτω εἰσρεῖ τῆς ἐκροῆς͵ 
And some burst forth again on the opposite side, and some on the same side, 
καὶ ἔνια μὲν καταντικρὺ ἢ ᾗ [εἰσρεῖ] ἐξέπεσεν͵ ἔνια δὲ κατὰ τὸ αὐτὸ μέρος· 
and some wind round the earth with one or many folds, like the coils of a serpent, and descend as far as they can, 
ἔστι δὲ ἃ παντάπασιν κύκλῳ περιελθόντα͵ ἢ ἅπαξ ἢ καὶ πλεονάκις περιελιχθέντα περὶ τὴν γῆν ὥσπερ οἱ ὄφεις͵ 
but always return and fall into the lake.   εἰς τὸ δυνατὸν κάτω καθέντα πάλιν ἐμβάλλει. 

# 112e
[pl.phaedo.112e](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0170:text=Phaedo:section=112e)
The rivers on either side can descend only to the center and no further, 
δυνατὸν δέ ἐστιν ἑκατέρωσε μέχρι τοῦ μέσου καθιέναι͵ πέρα δ΄ οὔ· 
for to the rivers on both sides the opposite side is a precipice.
ἄναντες γὰρ ἀμφοτέροις τοῖς ῥεύμασι τὸ ἑκατέρωθεν γίγνεται μέρος.
Now these rivers are many, and mighty, and diverse, 
Τὰ μὲν οὖν δὴ ἄλλα πολλά τε καὶ μεγάλα καὶ παντοδαπὰ ῥεύματά ἐστι· 
and there are four principal ones,     
τυγχάνει δ΄ ἄρα ὄντα ἐν τούτοις τοῖς πολλοῖς τέτταρ΄ ἄττα ῥεύματα͵ 
of which the greatest and outermost is that called Oceanus, which flows round the earth in a circle;
ὧν τὸ μὲν μέγιστον καὶ ἐξωτάτω ῥέον περὶ κύκλῳ ὁ καλούμενος Ὠκεανός ἐστιν͵ 
and in the opposite direction flows Acheron, 
τούτου δὲ καταντικρὺ καὶ ἐναντίως ῥέων Ἀχέρων͵

# 113a
[pl.phaedo.113a](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0170:text=Phaedo:section=113a)
which passes under the earth through desert places, into the Acherusian Lake: 
ὃς δι΄ ἐρήμων τε τόπων ῥεῖ ἄλλων καὶ δὴ καὶ ὑπὸ γῆν ῥέων εἰς τὴν λίμνην ἀφικνεῖται τὴν Ἀχερουσιάδα͵ 
this is the lake to the shores of which the souls of the many go when they are dead, 
οὗ αἱ τῶν τετελευτηκότων ψυχαὶ τῶν πολλῶν ἀφικνοῦνται 
and after waiting an appointed time, 
καί τινας εἱμαρμένους χρόνους μείνασαι͵ 
which is to some a longer and to some a shorter time, 
αἱ μὲν μακροτέρους͵ αἱ δὲ βραχυτέρους͵ 
they are sent back again to be born as animals. 
πάλιν ἐκπέμπονται εἰς τὰς τῶν ζῴων γενέσεις. 
The third river rises between the two, 
τρίτος δὲ ποταμὸς τούτων κατὰ μέσον ἐκβάλλει͵ 
and near the place of rising pours into a vast region of fire, 
καὶ ἐγγὺς τῆς ἐκβολῆς ἐκπίπτει εἰς τόπον μέγαν πυρὶ πολλῷ καόμενον͵ 
and forms a lake larger than the Mediterranean Sea, boiling with water and mud;   καὶ λίμνην ποιεῖ μείζω τῆς παρ΄ ἡμῖν θαλάττης͵ ζέουσαν ὕδατος καὶ πηλοῦ·   

# 113b
[pl.phaedo.113b](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0170:text=Phaedo:section=113b)
and proceeding muddy and turbid, and winding about the earth, 
ἐντεῦθεν δὲ χωρεῖ κύκλῳ θολερὸς καὶ πηλώδης͵ περιελιττόμενος δὲ τῇ γῇ 
comes, among other places, to the extremities of the Acherusian Lake, 
ἄλλοσέ τε ἀφικνεῖται καὶ παρ΄ ἔσχατα τῆς Ἀχερουσιάδος λίμνης͵ 
but mingles not with the waters of the lake, 
οὐ συμμειγνύμενος τῷ ὕδατι· 
and after making many coils about the earth plunges into Tartarus at a deeper level. 
περιελιχθεὶς δὲ πολλάκις ὑπὸ γῆς ἐμβάλλει κατωτέρω τοῦ Ταρτάρου· 
This is that Pyriphlegethon, as the stream is called, 
οὗτος δ΄ ἐστὶν ὃν ἐπονομάζουσιν Πυριφλεγέθοντα͵ 
which throws up jets of fire in all sorts of places. 
οὗ καὶ οἱ ῥύακες ἀπο σπάσματα ἀναφυσῶσιν ὅπῃ ἂν τύχωσι τῆς γῆς. 
The fourth river goes out on the opposite side, 
τούτου δὲ αὖ καταντικρὺ ὁ τέταρτος 
and falls first of all into a wild and savage region, 
ἐκπίπτει εἰς τόπον πρῶτον δεινόν τε καὶ ἄγριον͵ ὡς λέγεται͵ 
which is all of a dark-blue color, like lapis lazuli; 

# 113c
[pl.phaedo.113c](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0170:text=Phaedo:section=113c)
and this is that river which is called the Stygian River, 
χρῶμα δ΄ ἔχοντα ὅλον οἷον ὁ κυανός͵ ὃν δὴ ἐπονομάζουσι Στύγιον͵ 
and falls into and forms the Lake Styx, 
καὶ τὴν λίμνην ἣν ποιεῖ ὁ ποταμὸς ἐμβάλλων͵ Στύγα· 
and after falling into the lake and receiving strange powers in the waters, passes under the earth, 
ὁ δ΄ ἐμπεσὼν ἐνταῦθα καὶ δεινὰς δυνάμεις λαβὼν ἐν τῷ ὕδατι͵ δὺς κατὰ τῆς γῆς͵ 
winding round in the opposite direction to Pyriphlegethon, 
περιελιττόμενος χωρεῖ ἐναντίος τῷ Πυριφλεγέθοντι 
and meeting in the Acherusian Lake from the opposite side. 
καὶ ἀπαντᾷ ἐν τῇ Ἀχερουσιάδι λίμνῃ ἐξ ἐναντίας· 
And the water of this river too mingles with no other, 
καὶ οὐδὲ τὸ τούτου ὕδωρ οὐδενὶ μείγνυται͵ 
but flows round in a circle and falls into Tartarus over against Pyriphlegethon, 
ἀλλὰ καὶ οὗτος κύκλῳ περιελθὼν ἐμβάλλει εἰς τὸν Τάρταρον ἐναντίος τῷ Πυριφλεγέθοντι· 
and the name of this river, as the poet says, is Cocytus.
ὄνομα δὲ τούτῳ ἐστίν͵ ὡς οἱ ποιηταὶ λέγουσιν͵ Κωκυτός.

# 113d
[pl.phaedo.113d](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0170:text=Phaedo:section=113d)
Such is the name of the other world; 
Τούτων δὲ οὕτως πεφυκότων͵ 
and when the dead arrive at the place 
ἐπειδὰν ἀφίκωνται οἱ τετελευτηκότες εἰς τὸν τόπον 
to which the genius of each severally conveys them, 
οἷ ὁ δαίμων ἕκαστον κομίζει͵ 
first of all they have sentence passed upon them, as they have lived well and piously or not. 
πρῶτον μὲν διεδικάσαντο οἵ τε καλῶς καὶ ὁσίως βιώσαντες καὶ οἱ μή. 
And those who appear to have lived neither well nor ill, go to the river Acheron, 
καὶ οἳ μὲν ἂν δόξωσι μέσως βεβιωκέναι͵ πορευθέντες ἐπὶ τὸν Ἀχέροντα͵ 
and mount such conveyances as they can get, 
ἀναβάντες ἃ δὴ αὐτοῖς ὀχήματά ἐστιν͵ 
and are carried in them to the lake,  
ἐπὶ τούτων ἀφικνοῦνται εἰς τὴν λίμνην͵ 
and there they dwell and are purified of their evil deeds, 
καὶ ἐκεῖ οἰκοῦσί τε καὶ καθαιρόμενοι τῶν τε ἀδικημάτων 
and suffer the penalty of the wrongs which they have done to others, and are absolved, 
διδόντες δίκας ἀπολύονται͵ εἴ τίς τι ἠδίκηκεν͵ 

# 113e
[pl.phaedo.113e](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0170:text=Phaedo:section=113e)
and receive the rewards of their good deeds according to their deserts.
τῶν τε εὐεργεσιῶν τιμὰς φέρονται κατὰ τὴν ἀξίαν ἕκαστος· 
But those who appear to be incurable by reason of the greatness of their crimes-
οἳ δ΄ ἂν δόξωσιν ἀνιάτως ἔχειν διὰ τὰ μεγέθη τῶν ἁμαρτημάτων͵ 
who have committed many and terrible deeds of sacrilege, murders foul and violent, or the like-
ἢ ἱεροσυλίας πολλὰς καὶ μεγάλας ἢ φόνους ἀδίκους καὶ παρανόμους πολλοὺς ἐξειργασμένοι ἢ ἄλλα ὅσα 
such are hurled into Tartarus, which is their suitable destiny,   τοιαῦτα τυγχάνει ὄντα͵ τούτους δὲ ἡ προσήκουσα μοῖρα ῥίπτει εἰς τὸν Τάρταρον͵   
and they never come out.                    
ὅθεν οὔποτε ἐκβαίνουσιν. 
Those again who have committed crimes, which, although great, are not unpardonable-
οἳ δ΄ ἂν ἰάσιμα μὲν μεγάλα δὲ δόξωσιν ἡμαρτηκέναι ἁμαρτήματα͵ 

# 114a
[pl.phaedo.114a](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0170:text=Phaedo:section=114a)
who in a moment of anger, for example, have done violence to a father or mother, 
οἷον πρὸς πατέρα ἢ μητέρα ὑπ΄ ὀργῆς βίαιόν τι πράξαντες͵ 
and have repented for the remainder of their lives, 
καὶ μεταμέλον αὐτοῖς τὸν ἄλλον βίον βιῶσιν͵ 
or who have taken the life of another under like extenuating circumstances-
ἢ ἀνδροφόνοι τοιούτῳ τινὶ ἄλλῳ τρόπῳ γένωνται͵ 
these are plunged into Tartarus,        
τούτους δὲ ἐμπεσεῖν μὲν εἰς τὸν Τάρταρον ἀνάγκη͵ 
the pains of which they are compelled to undergo for a year, but at the end of the year the wave casts them forth-
ἐμπεσόντας δὲ αὐτοὺς καὶ ἐνιαυτὸν ἐκεῖ γενομένους ἐκβάλλει τὸ κῦμα͵ 
mere homicides by way of Cocytus,  
τοὺς μὲν ἀνδροφόνους κατὰ τὸν Κωκυτόν͵ 
parricides and matricides by Pyriphlegethon-
τοὺς δὲ πατραλοίας καὶ μητραλοίας κατὰ τὸν Πυριφλεγέθοντα· 
and they are borne to the Acherusian Lake, 
ἐπειδὰν δὲ φερόμενοι γένωνται κατὰ τὴν λίμνην τὴν Ἀχερουσιάδα͵ 
and there they lift up their voices and call upon the victims whom they have slain or wronged,

to have pity on them, and to receive them, and to let them come out of the river into the lake. 
καλέσαντες δ΄ ἱκετεύουσι καὶ δέονται ἐᾶσαι σφᾶς ἐκβῆναι εἰς τὴν λίμνην καὶ δέξασθαι͵ 
And if they prevail, then they come forth and cease from their troubles; 
καὶ ἐὰν μὲν πείσωσιν͵ ἐκβαίνουσί τε καὶ λήγουσι τῶν κακῶν͵ 
but if not, they are carried back again into Tartarus 
εἰ δὲ μή͵ φέρονται αὖθις εἰς τὸν Τάρταρον 
and from thence into the rivers unceasingly, 
καὶ ἐκεῖθεν πάλιν εἰς τοὺς ποταμούς͵ 
until they obtain mercy from those whom they have wronged: 
καὶ ταῦτα πάσχοντες οὐ πρότερον παύονται πρὶν ἂν πείσωσιν οὓς ἠδίκησαν· 
for that is the sentence inflicted upon them by their judges. 
αὕτη γὰρ ἡ δίκη ὑπὸ τῶν δικαστῶν αὐτοῖς ἐτάχθη. 
Those also who are remarkable for having led holy lives are released from this earthly prison, 
οἳ δὲ δὴ ἂν δόξωσι διαφερόντως πρὸς τὸ ὁσίως βιῶναι͵ οὗτοί εἰσιν οἱ τῶνδε μὲν τῶν τόπων τῶν ἐν τῇ γῇ ἐλευθερούμενοί τε καὶ ἀπαλλαττόμενοι ὥσπερ δεσμωτηρίων͵

and those who have duly purified themselves with philosophy

live henceforth altogether without the body,

ὁ δ᾽ οὐκ ἔφη. καὶ μετὰ τοῦτο αὖθις τὰς κνήμας: καὶ ἐπανιὼν οὕτως ἡμῖν ἐπεδείκνυτο ὅτι ψύχοιτό τε καὶ πήγνυτο. καὶ αὐτὸς ἥπτετο καὶ εἶπεν ὅτι, ἐπειδὰν πρὸς τῇ καρδίᾳ γένηται αὐτῷ, τότε οἰχήσεται.
ἤδη οὖν σχεδόν τι αὐτοῦ ἦν τὰ περὶ τὸ ἦτρον ψυχόμενα, καὶ ἐκκαλυψάμενος—ἐνεκεκάλυπτο γάρ—εἶπεν—ὃ δὴ τελευταῖον ἐφθέγξατο—‘ὦ Κρίτων, ἔφη, τῷ Ἀσκληπιῷ ὀφείλομεν ἀλεκτρυόνα: ἀλλὰ ἀπόδοτε καὶ μὴ ἀμελήσητε.’

ἀλλὰ ταῦτα, ἔφη, ἔσται, ὁ Κρίτων: ἀλλ᾽ ὅρα εἴ τι ἄλλο λέγεις.

ταῦτα ἐρομένου αὐτοῦ οὐδὲν ἔτι ἀπεκρίνατο, ἀλλ᾽ ὀλίγον χρόνον διαλιπὼν ἐκινήθη τε καὶ ὁ ἄνθρωπος ἐξεκάλυψεν αὐτόν, καὶ ὃς τὰ ὄμματα ἔστησεν: ἰδὼν δὲ ὁ Κρίτων συνέλαβε τὸ στόμα καὶ τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς.

ἥδε ἡ τελευτή, ὦ Ἐχέκρατες, τοῦ ἑταίρου ἡμῖν ἐγένετο, ἀνδρός, ὡς ἡμεῖς φαῖμεν ἄν, τῶν τότε ὧν ἐπειράθημεν ἀρίστου καὶ ἄλλως φρονιμωτάτου καὶ δικαιοτάτου.

his thighs; and passing upwards in this way he showed us that he was growing cold and rigid. And again he touched him and said that when it reached his heart, he would be gone. The chill had now reached the region about the groin, and uncovering his face, which had been covered, he said—and these were his last words—“Crito, we owe a cock to Aesculapius. Pay it and do not neglect it.” “That,” said Crito, “shall be done; but see if you have anything else to say.” To this question he made no reply, but after a little while he moved; the attendant uncovered him; his eyes were fixed. And Crito when he saw it, closed his mouth and eyes.
Such was the end, Echecrates, of our friend, who was, as we may say, of all those of his time whom we have known, the best and wisest and most righteous man.
