And straightway he came to Pelias to share the banquet which the king was offering to his father Poseidon and the rest of the gods, though he paid no honour to Pelasgian Hera. Quickly the king saw him and pondered, and devised for him the toil of a troublous voyage, in order that on the sea or among strangers he might lose his home-return.

[18] The ship, as former bards relate, Argus wrought by the guidance of Athena. But now I will tell the lineage and the names of the heroes, and of the long sea-paths and the deeds they wrought in their wanderings; may the Muses be the inspirers of my song!

[23] First then let us name Orpheus whom once Calliope bare, it is said, wedded to Thracian Oeagrus, near the Pimpleian height. Men say that he by the music of his songs charmed the stubborn rocks upon the mountains and the course of rivers. And the wild oak-trees to this day, tokens of that magic strain, that grow at Zone on the Thracian shore, stand in ordered ranks close together, the same which under the charm of his lyre he led down from Pieria. Such then was Orpheus whom Aeson's son welcomed to share his toils, in obedience to the behest of Cheiron, Orpheus ruler of Bistonian Pieria.

[35] Straightway came Asterion, whom Cometes begat by the waters of eddying Apidanus; he dwelt at Peiresiae near the Phylleian mount, where mighty Apidanus and bright Enipeus join their streams, coming together from afar.

[40] Next to them from Larisa came Polyphemus, son of Eilatus, who aforetime among the mighty Lapithae, when they were arming themselves against the Centaurs, fought in his younger days;

now his limbs were grown heavy with age, but his martial spirit still remained, even as of old.

[45] Nor was Iphiclus long left behind in Phylace, the uncle of Aeson's son; for Aeson had wedded his sister Alcimede, daughter of Phylacus: his kinship with her bade him be numbered in the host.

[49] Nor did Admetus, the lord of Pherae rich in sheep, stay behind beneath the peak of the Chalcodonian mount.

Thus he spake, and his words were welcome to Jason's ear. And he arose from his bed with joy and woke all his comrades hurriedly and told them the prophecy of Mopsus the son of Ampycus. And quickly the younger men drove oxen from their stalls and began to lead them to the mountain's lofty summit. And they loosed the hawsers from the sacred rock and rowed to the Thracian harbour; and the heroes climbed the mountain, leaving a few of their comrades in the ship. 
### 1112-1152
τοῖσι δὲ Μακριάδες σκοπιαὶ καὶ πᾶσα περαίη
Θρηικίης ἐνὶ χερσὶν ἑαῖς προυφαίνετ᾽ ἰδέσθαι:

And to them the Macrian heights and all the coast of Thrace opposite appeared to view close at hand. 

φαίνετο δ᾽ ἠερόεν στόμα Βοσπόρου ἠδὲ κολῶναι
1115Μυσίαι: 

And there appeared the misty mouth of Bosporus and the Mysian hills; 

ἐκ δ᾽ ἑτέρης ποταμοῦ ῥόος Αἰσήποιο
ἄστυ τε καὶ πεδίον Νηπήιον Ἀδρηστείης.

and on the other side the stream of the river Aesepus and the city and Nepeian plain of Adrasteia. 

ἔσκε δέ τι στιβαρὸν στύπος ἀμπέλου ἔντροφον ὕλῃ,
πρόχνυ γεράνδρυον: 

Now there was a sturdy stump of vine that grew in the forest, a tree exceeding old; 

τὸ μὲν ἔκταμον, ὄφρα πέλοιτο
δαίμονος οὐρείης ἱερὸν βρέτας: 

this they cut down, to be the sacred image of the mountain goddess; 

ἔξεσε δ᾽ Ἄργος
1120εὐκόσμως, καὶ δή μιν ἐπ᾽ ὀκριόεντι κολωνῷ
ἵδρυσαν φηγοῖσιν ἐπηρεφὲς ἀκροτάτῃσιν,
αἵ ῥά τε πασάων πανυπέρταται ἐρρίζωνται.

and Argus smoothed it skilfully, and they set it upon that rugged hill beneath a canopy of lofty oaks, which of all trees have their roots deepest. 

βωμὸν δ᾽ αὖ χέραδος παρενήνεον: 

And near it they heaped an altar of small stones, 

ἀμφὶ δὲ φύλλοις
στεψάμενοι δρυΐνοισι θυηπολίης ἐμέλοντο

and wreathed their brows with oak leaves and paid heed to sacrifice, 

1125μητέρα Δινδυμίην πολυπότνιαν ἀγκαλέοντες,
ἐνναέτιν Φρυγίης, 

invoking the mother of Dindymum, most venerable, dweller in Phrygia, 

Τιτίην θ᾽ ἅμα Κύλληνόν τε,

and Titias and Cyllenus, 

οἳ μοῦνοι πολέων μοιρηγέται 

who alone of many are called dispensers of doom 

ἠδὲ πάρεδροι
μητέρος Ἰδαίης κεκλήαται, 

and assessors of the Idaean mother, -- 

ὅσσοι ἔασιν
δάκτυλοι Ἰδαῖοι Κρηταιέες, 

the Idaean Dactyls of Crete, 

οὕς ποτε νύμφη
1130Ἀγχιάλη Δικταῖον ἀνὰ σπέος ἀμφοτέρῃσιν
δραξαμένη γαίης Οἰαξίδος ἐβλάστησεν.

whom once the nymph Anchiale, as she grasped with both hands the land of Oaxus, bare in the Dictaean cave. 

πολλὰ δὲ τήνγε λιτῇσιν ἀποστρέψαι ἐριώλας
Λἰσονίδης γουνάζετ᾽ ἐπιλλείβων ἱεροῖσιν
αἰθομένοις: 

And with many prayers did Aeson's son beseech the goddess to turn aside the stormy blasts as he poured libations on the blazing sacrifice; 

ἄμυδις δὲ νέοι Ὀρφῆος ἀνωγῇ
1135σκαίροντες βηταρμὸν ἐνόπλιον ὠρχήσαντο,

and at the same time by command of Orpheus the youths trod a measure dancing in full armour, 

καὶ σάκεα ξιφέεσσιν ἐπέκτυπον, 

and clashed with their swords on their shields, 

ὥς κεν ἰωὴ
δύσφημος πλάζοιτο δι᾽ ἠέρος, 

so that the ill-omened cry might be lost in the air the wail 

ἣν ἔτι λαοὶ
κηδείῃ βασιλῆος ἀνέστενον. 

which the people were still sending up in grief for their king. 

ἔνθεν ἐσαιεὶ
ῥόμβῳ καὶ τυπάνῳ Ῥείην Φρύγες ἱλάσκονται.

Hence from that time forward the Phrygians propitiate Rhea with the wheel and the drum. 

1140ἡ δέ που εὐαγέεσσιν ἐπὶ φρένα θῆκε θυηλαῖς
ἀνταίη δαίμων: τὰ δ᾽ ἐοικότα σήματ᾽ ἔγεντο.

And the gracious goddess, I ween, inclined her heart to pious sacrifices; and favourable signs appeared. 

δένδρεα μὲν καρπὸν χέον ἄσπετον, ἀμφὶ δὲ ποσσὶν
αὐτομάτη φύε γαῖα τερείνης ἄνθεα ποίης.

The trees shed abundant fruit, and round their feet the earth of its own accord put forth flowers from the tender grass. 

θῆρες δ᾽ εἰλυούς τε κατὰ ξυλόχους τε λιπόντες
1145οὐρῇσιν σαίνοντες ἐπήλυθον. 

And the beasts of the wild wood left their lairs and thickets and came up fawning on them with their tails. 

ἡ δὲ καὶ ἄλλο
θῆκε τέρας: 

And she caused yet another marvel; 

ἐπεὶ οὔτι παροίτερον ὕδατι νᾶεν
Δίνδυμον: 

for hitherto there was no flow of water on Dindymum, 

ἀλλά σφιν τότ᾽ ἀνέβραχε διψάδος αὔτως
ἐκ κορυφῆς ἄλληκτον: 

but then for them an unceasing stream gushed forth from the thirsty peak just as it was, 

Ἰησονίην δ᾽ ἐνέπουσιν
κεῖνο ποτὸν κρήνην περιναιέται ἄνδρες ὀπίσσω.

and the dwellers around in after times called that stream, the spring of Jason. 

1150καὶ τότε μὲν δαῖτ᾽ ἀμφὶ θεᾶς θέσαν οὔρεσιν Ἄρκτων,

And then they made a feast in honour of the goddess on the Mount of Bears, 

μέλποντες Ῥείην πολυπότνιαν: 

singing the praises of Rhea most venerable; 

αὐτὰρ ἐς ἠὼ
ληξάντων ἀνέμων νῆσον λίπον εἰρεσίῃσιν.

but at dawn the winds had ceased and they rowed away from the island.

καί νύ κε δηθύνοντες Ἀμαζονίδεσσιν ἔμιξαν
ὑσμίνην, καὶ δ᾽ οὔ κεν ἀναιμωτί γ᾽ ἐρίδηναν--
οὐ γὰρ Ἀμαζονίδες μάλ᾽ ἐπήτιδες, οὐδὲ θέμιστας
τίουσαι πεδίον Δοιάντιον ἀμφενέμοντο:
ἀλλ᾽ ὕβρις στονόεσσα καὶ Ἄρεος ἔργα μεμήλει:

And they would have tarried there and have closed in battle with the Amazons, and would have fought not without bloodshed for the Amazons were not gentle foes and regarded not justice, those dwellers on the Doeantian plain; but grievous insolence and the works of Ares were all their care; 

δὴ γὰρ καὶ γενεὴν ἔσαν Ἄρεος Ἁρμονίης τε
νύμφης, ἥ τ᾽ Ἄρηϊ φιλοπτολέμους τέκε κούρας,
ἄλσεος Ἀκμονίοιο κατὰ πτύχας εὐνηθεῖσα--
εἰ μὴ ἄρ᾽ ἐκ Διόθεν πνοιαὶ πάλιν Ἀργέσταο
ἤλυθον: οἱ δ᾽ ἀνέμῳ περιηγέα κάλλιπον ἀκτήν,
995ἔνθα Θεμισκύρειαι Ἀμαζόνες ὡπλίζοντο.

for by race they were the daughters of Ares and the nymph Harmonia, who bare to Ares war-loving maids, wedded to him in the glens of the Acmonian wood had not the breezes of Argestes come again from Zeus; and with the wind they left the rounded beach, where the Themiscyreian Amazons were arming for war.

### 132
Come, be ready to perform for me the task I will tell thee of, 

καί κέν τοι ὀπάσαιμι Διὸς περικαλλὲς ἄθυρμα
κεῖνο, 

and I will give thee Zeus' all-beauteous plaything -- 

τό οἱ ποίησε φίλη τροφὸς Ἀδρήστεια
ἄντρῳ ἐν Ἰδαίῳ ἔτι νήπια κουρίζοντι,
135σφαῖραν ἐυτρόχαλον, 

the one which his dear nurse Adrasteia made for him, while he still lived a child, with childish ways, in the Idaean cave -- a well-rounded ball; 

τῆς οὐ σύγε μείλιον ἄλλο
χειρῶν Ἡφαίστοιο κατακτεατίσσῃ ἄρειον.

no better toy wilt thou get from the hands of Hephaestus. 

χρύσεα μέν οἱ κύκλα τετεύχαται: ἀμφὶ δ᾽ ἑκάστῳ
διπλόαι ἁψῖδες περιηγέες εἱλίσσονται:

All of gold are its zones, and round each double seams run in a circle; 

κρυπταὶ δὲ ῥαφαί εἰσιν: ἕλιξ δ᾽ ἐπιδέδρομε πάσαις
140κυανέη. 

but the stitches are hidden, and a dark blue spiral overlays them all. 

ἀτὰρ εἴ μιν ἑαῖς ἐνὶ χερσὶ βάλοιο,
ἀστὴρ ὥς, φλεγέθοντα δι᾽ ἠέρος ὁλκὸν ἵησιν.

But if thou shouldst cast it with thy hands, lo, like a star, it sends a flaming track through the sky. 

This I will give thee; and do thou strike with thy shaft and charm the daughter of Aeetes with love for Jason; and let there be no loitering. For then my thanks would be the slighter.

but still he raised aloft his grisly head, 

ἀμφοτέρους ὀλοῇσι περιπτύξαι γενύεσσιν.

eager to enclose them both in his murderous jaws. 

ἡ δέ μιν ἀρκεύθοιο νέον τετμηότι θαλλῷ
βάπτουσ᾽ ἐκ κυκεῶνος ἀκήρατα φάρμακ᾽ ἀοιδαῖς
ῥαῖνε κατ᾽ ὀφθαλμῶν: 

But she with a newly cut spray of juniper, dipping and drawing untempered charms from her mystic brew, sprinkled his eyes, while she chanted her song; 

περί τ᾽ ἀμφί τε νήριτος ὀδμὴ
φαρμάκου ὕπνον ἔβαλλε: 

and all around the potent scent of the charm cast sleep; 

γένυν δ᾽ αὐτῇ ἐνὶ χώρῃ

and on the very spot he let his jaw sink down; 
### 160
θῆκεν ἐρεισάμενος: 

τὰ δ᾽ ἀπείρονα πολλὸν ὀπίσσω
κύκλα πολυπρέμνοιο διὲξ ὕλης τετάνυστο.

and far behind through the wood with its many trees were those countless coils stretched out.

ἔνθα δ᾽ ὁ μὲν χρύσειον ἀπὸ δρυὸς αἴνυτο κῶας,
κούρης κεκλομένης: 

Hereupon Jason snatched the golden fleece from the oak, at the maiden bidding; 

ἡ δ᾽ ἔμπεδον ἑστηυῖα
φαρμάκῳ ἔψηχεν θηρὸς κάρη, εἰσόκε δή μιν

and she, standing firm, smeared with the charm the monster's head, 



till Jason himself bade her turn back towards their ship, and she left the grove of Ares, dusky with shade.
