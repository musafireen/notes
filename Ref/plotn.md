Ἀναξαγόρας δὲ νοῦν καθαρὸν καὶ ἀμιγῆ λέγων ἁπλοῦν καὶ αὐτὸς τίθεται τὸ πρῶτον καὶ χωριστὸν τὸ ἕν, τὸ δ᾽ ἀκριβὲς δι᾽ ἀρχαιότητα παρῆκε. Καὶ Ἡράκλειτος δὲ τὸ ἓν οἶδεν ἀίδιον καὶ νοητόν· τὰ γὰρ σώματα γίγνεται ἀεὶ καὶ ῥέοντα. Τῶι δὲ Ἐμπεδοκλεῖ τὸ νεῖκος μὲν διαιρεῖ, ἡ δὲ φιλία τὸ ἕν – ἀσώματον δὲ καὶ αὐτὸς τοῦτο – τὰ δὲ στοιχεῖα ὡς ὕλη. Ἀριστοτέλης δὲ ὕστερον χωριστὸν μὲν τὸ πρῶτον καὶ νοητόν, νοεῖν δὲ αὐτὸ ἑαυτὸ λέγων πάλιν αὖ οὐ τὸ πρῶτον ποιεῖ· πολλὰ δὲ καὶ ἄλλα νοητὰ ποιῶν καὶ τοσαῦτα, ὁπόσαι ἐν οὐρανῶι σφαῖραι, ἵν᾽ ἕκαστον ἑκάστην κινῆι, ἄλλον τρόπον λέγει τὰ ἐν τοῖς νοητοῖς ἢ Πλάτων, τὸ εὔλογον οὐκ ἔχον ἀνάγκην τιθέμενος. Ἐπιστήσειε δ᾽ ἄν τις, εἰ καὶ εὐλόγως· εὐλογώτερον γὰρ πάσας πρὸς μίαν σύνταξιν συντελούσας πρὸς ἓν καὶ τὸ πρῶτον βλέπειν. Ζητήσειε δ᾽ ἄν τις τὰ πολλὰ νοητὰ εἰ ἐξ ἑνός ἐστιν αὐτῶι τοῦ πρώτου, ἢ πολλαὶ αἱ ἐν τοῖς νοητοῖς ἀρχαί· καὶ εἰ μὲν ἐξ ἑνός, ἀνάλογον δηλονότι ἕξει ὡς ἐν τοῖς αἰσθητοῖς αἱ σφαῖραι ἄλλης ἄλλην περιεχούσης, μιᾶς δὲ τῆς ἔξω κρατούσης· ὥστε περιέχοι ἂν κἀκεῖ τὸ πρῶτον καὶ κόσμος νοητὸς ἔσται· καὶ ὥσπερ ἐνταῦθα αἱ σφαῖραι οὐ κεναί, ἀλλὰ μεστὴ ἄστρων ἡ πρώτη, αἱ δὲ ἔχουσιν ἄστρα, οὕτω κἀκεῖ τὰ κινοῦντα πολλὰ ἐν αὐτοῖς ἕξει καὶ τὰ ἀληθέστερα ἐκεῖ. Εἰ δὲ ἕκαστον ἀρχή, κατὰ συντυχίαν αἱ ἀρχαὶ ἔσονται· καὶ διὰ τί συνέσονται καὶ πρὸς ἓν ἔργον τὴν τοῦ παντὸς οὐρανοῦ συμφωνίαν ὁμονοήσει; Πῶς δὲ ἴσα πρὸς τὰ νοητὰ καὶ κινοῦντα τὰ ἐν οὐρανῶι αἰσθητά; Πῶς δὲ καὶ πολλὰ οὕτως ἀσώματα ὄντα ὕλης οὐ χωριζούσης; Ὥστε τῶν ἀρχαίων οἱ μάλιστα συντασσόμενοι αὖ τοῖς Πυθαγόρου καὶ τῶν μετ᾽ αὐτὸν καὶ Φερεκύδους δὲ περὶ ταύτην μὲν ἔσχον τὴν φύσιν· ἀλλ᾽ οἱ μὲν ἐξειργάσαντο ἐν αὐτοῖς αὐτῶν λόγοις, οἱ δὲ οὐκ ἐν λόγοις, ἀλλ᾽ ἐν ἀγράφοις ἐδείκνυον συνουσίαις ἢ ὅλως ἀφεῖσαν.

Anaxagoras, again, in his assertion of a Mind pure and unmixed, affirms a simplex First and a sundered One, though writing long ago he failed in precision.

Heraclitus, with his sense of bodily forms as things of ceaseless process and passage, knows the One as eternal and intellectual.

In Empedocles, similarly, we have a dividing principle, "Strife," set against "Friendship"- which is The One and is to him bodiless, while the elements represent Matter.

Later there is Aristotle; he begins by making the First transcendent and intellective but cancels that primacy by supposing it to have self-intellection. Further he affirms a multitude of other intellective beings- as many indeed as there are orbs in the heavens; one such principle as in- over to every orb- and thus his account of the Intellectual Realm differs from Plato's and, failing reason, he brings in necessity; though whatever reasons he had alleged there would always have been the objection that it would be more reasonable that all the spheres, as contributory to one system, should look to a unity, to the First.

We are obliged also to ask whether to Aristotle's mind all Intellectual Beings spring from one, and that one their First; or whether the Principles in the Intellectual are many.

If from one, then clearly the Intellectual system will be analogous to that of the universe of sense-sphere encircling sphere, with one, the outermost, dominating all- the First [in the Intellectual] will envelop the entire scheme and will be an Intellectual [or Archetypal] Kosmos; and as in our universe the spheres are not empty but the first sphere is thick with stars and none without them, so, in the Intellectual Kosmos, those principles of Movement will envelop a multitude of Beings, and that world will be the realm of the greater reality.

If on the contrary each is a principle, then the effective powers become a matter of chance; under what compulsion are they to hold together and act with one mind towards that work of unity, the harmony of the entire heavenly system? Again what can make it necessary that the material bodies of the heavenly system be equal in number to the Intellectual moving principles, and how can these incorporeal Beings be numerically many when there is no Matter to serve as the basis of difference?

For these reasons the ancient philosophers that ranged themselves most closely to the school of Pythagoras and of his later followers and to that of Pherecydes, have insisted upon this Nature, some developing the subject in their writings while others treated of it merely in unwritten discourses, some no doubt ignoring it entirely.

TO THE THREE PRINCIPLES IN THE UNIVERSE MUST CORRESPOND THREE PRINCIPLES IN US.

Ὅτι δὲ οὕτω χρὴ νομίζειν ἔχειν, ὡς ἔστι μὲν τὸ ἐπέκεινα ὄντος τὸ ἕν, οἷον ἤθελεν ὁ λόγος δεικνύναι ὡς οἷόν τε ἦν περὶ τούτων ἐνδείκνυσθαι, ἔστι δὲ ἐφεξῆς τὸ ὂν καὶ νοῦς, τρίτη δὲ ἡ τῆς ψυχῆς φύσις, ἤδη δέδεικται. Ὥσπερ δὲ ἐν τῆι φύσει τριττὰ ταῦτά ἐστι τὰ εἰρημένα, οὕτω χρὴ νομίζειν καὶ παρ᾽ ἡμῖν ταῦτα εἶναι. Λέγω δὲ οὐκ ἐν τοῖς αἰσθητοῖς – χωριστὰ γὰρ ταῦτα – ἀλλ᾽ ἐπὶ τοῖς αἰσθητῶν ἔξω, καὶ τὸν αὐτὸν τρόπον τὸ ἔξω ὥσπερ κἀκεῖνα τοῦ παντὸς οὐρανοῦ ἔξω· οὕτω καὶ τὰ τοῦ ἀνθρώπου, οἷον λέγει Πλάτων τὸν εἴσω ἄνθρωπον. Ἔστι τοίνυν καὶ ἡ ἡμετέρα ψυχὴ θεῖόν τι καὶ φύσεως ἄλλης, ὁποία πᾶσα ἡ ψυχῆς φύσις· τελεία δὲ ἡ νοῦν ἔχουσα· νοῦς δὲ ὁ μὲν λογιζόμενος, ὁ δὲ λογίζεσθαι παρέχων. Τὸ δὴ λογιζόμενον τοῦτο τῆς ψυχῆς οὐδενὸς πρὸς τὸ λογίζεσθαι δεόμενον σωματικοῦ ὀργάνου, τὴν δὲ ἐνέργειαν ἑαυτοῦ ἐν καθαρῶι ἔχον, ἵνα καὶ λογίζεσθαι καθαρῶς οἷόν τε ἦι, χωριστὸν καὶ οὐ κεκραμένον σώματι ἐν τῶι πρώτωι νοητῶι τις τιθέμενος οὐκ ἂν σφάλλοιτο. Οὐ γὰρ τόπον ζητητέον οὗ ἱδρύσομεν, ἀλλ᾽ ἔξω τόπου παντὸς ποιητέον. Οὕτω γὰρ τὸ καθ᾽ αὑτὸ καὶ τὸ ἔξω καὶ τὸ ἄυλον, ὅταν μόνον ἦι οὐδὲν ἔχον παρὰ τῆς σώματος φύσεως. Διὰ τοῦτο καὶ ἔτι ἔξωθέν φησιν ἐπὶ τοῦ παντὸς τὴν ψυχὴν περιέβαλεν ἐνδεικνύμενος τῆς ψυχῆς τὸ ἐν τῶι νοητῶι μένον· ἐπὶ δὲ ἡμῶν ἐπικρύπτων ἐπ᾽ ἄκραι εἴρηκε τῆι κεφαλῆι. Καὶ ἡ παρακέλευσις δὲ τοῦ χωρίζειν οὐ τόπωι λέγεται – τοῦτο γὰρ φύσει κεχωρισμένον ἐστίν – ἀλλὰ τῆι μὴ νεύσει καὶ ταῖς φαντασίαις καὶ τῆι ἀλλοτριότητι τῆι πρὸς τὸ σῶμα, εἴ πως καὶ τὸ λοιπὸν ψυχῆς εἶδος ἀναγάγοι τις καὶ συνενέγκαι πρὸς τὸ ἄνω καὶ τὸ ἐνταῦθα αὐτῆς ἱδρυμένον, ὃ μόνον ἐστὶ σώματος δημιουργὸν καὶ πλαστικὸν καὶ τὴν πραγματείαν περὶ τοῦτο ἔχον.

Above existence, therefore, is the One. This has by us been proved as far as could reasonably be expected, and as far as such subjects admit of demonstration. In the second rank are Existence and Intelligence; in the third, the Soul. But if these three principles, the One, Intelligence, and the Soul, as we have said, obtain in nature, three principles must also obtain within us. I do not mean that these three principles are in sense-objects, for they are separate therefrom; they are outside of the sense-world, as the three divine principles are outside of the celestial sphere, and, according to Plato's expression,254 they constitute the "the interior man." Our soul, therefore, is something divine; it has a nature different (from sense-nature), which conforms to that of the universal Soul. Now the perfect Soul possesses intelligence; but we must distinguish between the intelligence that reasons (the discursive reason), and the Intelligence that furnishes the principles of reasoning (pure intelligence). The discursive reason of the soul has no need, for operation, of any bodily organ;255 in its operations, it190 preserves all its purity, so that it is capable of reasoning purely. When separated from the body, it must, without any hesitation, be ranked with highest intellectual entities. There is no need of locating it in space; for, if it exist within itself, outside of body, in an immaterial condition, it is evidently not mingled with the body, and has none of its nature. Consequently Plato256 says, "The divinity has spread the Soul around the world." What he here means is that a part of the Soul remains in the intelligible world. Speaking of our soul he also says, "she hides her head in heaven."257 He also advises us to wean the soul from the body; and he does not refer to any local separation, which nature alone could establish. He means that the soul must not incline towards the body, must not abandon herself to the phantoms of imagination, and must not, thus, become alienated from reason. He means that the soul should try to elevate to the intelligible world her lower part which is established in the sense-world, and which is occupied in fashioning the body.258
