a taphris per continentem introrsus tenent auchetae, apud quos hypanis oritur, neuroe, apud quos borysthenes, geloni, thyssagetae, budini, basilidae et caeruleo capillo agathyrsi. 

Leaving Taphræ, and going along the mainland, we find in the interior the Auchetæ48, in whose country the Hypanis has its rise, as also the Neurœ, in whose district the Borysthenes has its source, the Geloni49, the Thyssagetæ, the Budini, the Basilidæ, and the Agathyrsi50 with their azure-coloured hair. 

super eos nomades, deinde anthropophagi, a buce vero super maeotim sauromatae et essedones. 

Above them are the Nomades, and then a nation of Anthropophagi or cannibals. On leaving Lake Buges, above the Lake Mæotis we come to the Sauromatæ and the Essedones51. 

at per oram ad tanain usque maeotae, a quibus lacus nomen accepit, ultimique a tergo eorum arimaspi. 

Along the coast, as far as the river Tanais52, are the Mæotæ, from whom the lake derives its name, and the last of all, in the rear of them, the Arimaspi. 

mox ripaei montes et adsiduo nivis casu pinnarum similitudine pterophoros appellata regio, pars mundi damnata a rerum natura et densa mersa caligine neque in alio quam rigoris opere gelidisque aquilonis conceptaculis.

We then come to the Riphæan53 mountains, and the region known by the name of Pterophoros54, because of the perpetual fall of snow there, the flakes of which resemble feathers; a part of the world which has been condemned by the decree of nature to lie immersed in thick darkness; suited for nothing but the generation of cold, and to be the asylum of the chilling blasts of the northern winds.

[[#c26]]

pone eos montes ultraque aquilonem gens felix, si credimus, quos hyperboreos appellavere, annoso degit aevo, fabulosis celebrata miraculis. 

Behind these mountains, and beyond the region of the northern winds, there dwells, if we choose to believe it, a happy race, known as the Hyperborei55, a race that lives to an extreme old age, and which has been the subject of many marvellous stories56. 

ibi creduntur esse cardines mundi extremique siderum ambitus semenstri luce et una die solis adversi, non, ut imperiti dixere, ab aequinoctio verno in autumnum: 

At this spot are supposed to be the hinges upon which the world revolves, and the extreme limits of the revolutions of the stars. Here we find light for six months together, given by the sun in one continuous day, who does not, however, as some ignorant persons have asserted, conceal himself from the vernal equinox57 to autumn. 

semel in anno solstitio oriuntur iis soles brumaque semel occidunt. 

On the contrary, to these people there is but one rising of the sun for the year, and that at the summer solstice, and but one setting, at the winter solstice. 

regio aprica, felici temperie, omni adflatu noxio carens. 

This region, warmed by the rays of the sun, is of a most delightful temperature, and exempt from every noxious blast. 

domus iis nemora lucique, et deorum cultus viritim gregatimque, discordia ignota et aegritudo omnis. 

The abodes of the natives are the woods and groves; the gods receive their worship singly and in groups, while all discord and every kind of sickness are things utterly unknown. 

mors non nisi satietate vitae epulatis delibutoque senio luxu e quadam rupe in mare salientibus; hoc genus sepulturae beatissimum. 

Death comes upon them only when satiated with life; after a career of feasting, in an old age sated with every luxury, they leap from a certain rock there into the sea; and this they deem the most desirable mode of ending existence. 

quidam eos in prima parte asiae litorum posuere, non in europa, quia sunt ibi similitudine et situs attacorum nomine. 

Some writers have placed these people, not in Europe, but at the very verge of the shores of Asia, because we find there a people called the Attacori58, who greatly resemble them and occupy a very similar locality. 

alii medios fecere eos inter utrumque solem, antipodum occasus exorientemque nostrum, quod fieri nullo modo potest tam vasto mari interveniente. 

Other writers again have placed them midway between the two suns, at the spot where it sets to the Antipodes and rises to us; a thing however that cannot possibly be, in consequence of the vast tract of sea which there intervenes. 

qui alibi quam in semenstri luce constituere eos, serere matutinis, meridie metere, occidente fetus arborum decerpere, noctibus in specus condi tradiderunt. 

Those writers who place them nowhere59 but under a day which lasts for six months, state that in the morning they sow, at mid-day they reap, at sunset they gather in the fruits of the trees, and during the night conceal themselves in caves. 

nec licet dubitare de gente ea: tot auctores produnt frugum primitias solitos delum mittere apollini, quem praecipue colunt. 

Nor are we at liberty to entertain any doubts as to the existence of this race; so many authors60 are there who assert that they were in the habit of sending their first-fruits to Delos to present them to Apollo, whom in especial they worship. 

virgines ferebant eas, hospitiis gentium per annos aliquot venerabiles, donec violata fide in proximis accolarum finibus deponere sacra ea instituere iique ad conterminos deferre atque ita delum usque. 

Virgins used to carry them, who for many years were held in high veneration, and received the rites of hospitality from the nations that lay on the route; until at last, in consequence of repeated violations of good faith, the Hyperboreans came to the determination to deposit these offerings upon the frontiers of the people who adjoined them, and they in their turn were to convey them on to their neighbours, and so from one to the other, till they should have arrived at Delos. 

However, this custom, even, in time fell into disuse.

mox et hoc ipsum exolevit. 

sarmatiae, scythiae, tauricae omnisque a borysthene amne tractus longitudo [dcccclxxx], latitudo [dccxvi] a m. agrippa tradita est. ego incertam in hac terrarum parte mensuram arbitror.

supra nasamonas confinesque illis machlyas androgynos esse utriusque naturae, inter se vicibus coeuntes, calliphanes tradit. aristoteles adicit dextram mammam iis virilem, laevam muliebrem esse. 

Above the Nasamones,21 and the Machlytæ, who border upon them, are found, as we learn from Calliphanes, the nation of the Androgyni, a people who unite the two sexes in the same individual, and alternately perform the functions of each. Aristotle also states, that their right breast is that of a male, the left that of a female.22

in eadem africa familias quasdam effascinantium isigonus et nymphodorus, quorum laudatione intereant probata, arescant arbores, emoriantur infantes. esse eiusdem generis in triballis et illyris adicit isigonus, qui visu quoque effascinent interemantque quos diutius intueantur, iratis praecipue oculis, quod eorum malum facilius sentire puberes;

Isigonus and Nymphodorus inform us that there are in Africa certain families of enchanters,23 who, by means of their charms, in the form of commendations, can cause cattle to perish, trees to wither, and infants to die. Isigonus adds, that there are among the Triballi and the Illyrii, some persons of this description, who also have the power of fascination with the eyes, and can even kill those on whom they fix their gaze for any length of time, more especially if their look denotes anger; the age of puberty is said to be particularly obnoxious to the malign influence of such persons.24

notabilius esse quod pupillas binas in oculis singulis habeant. huius generis et feminas in scythia, quae bitiae vocantur, prodit apollonides. phylarchus et in ponto thibiorum genus multosque alios eiusdem naturae, quorum notas tradit in altero oculo geminam pupillam, in altero equi effigiem; eosdem praeterea non posse mergi, ne veste quidem degravatos. haut dissimile iis genus pharmacum in aethiopia damon, quorum sudor tabem contactis corporibus afferat. feminas quidem omnes ubique visu nocere quae duplices pupillas habeant, cicero quoque apud nos auctor est. adeo naturae, cum ferarum morem vescendi humanis visceribus in homine genuisset, gignere etiam in toto corpore et in quorundam oculis quoque venena placuit, ne quid usquam mali esset quod in homine non esset.

A still more remarkable circumstance is, the fact that these persons have two pupils in each eye.25 Apollonides says, that there are certain females of this description in Scythia, who are known as Bythiæ, and Phylarchus states that a tribe of the Thibii in Pontus, and many other persons as well, have a double pupil in one eye, and in the other the figure of a horse.26 He also remarks, that the bodies of these persons will not sink in water,27 even though weighed down by their garments. Damon gives an account of a race of people, not very much unlike them, the Pharnaces of Æthiopia, whose perspiration is productive of consumption28 to the body of every person that it touches. Cicero also, one of our own writers, makes the remark, that the glances of all women who have a double pupil is noxious.29

vnguentis cognomina dedere aliis patriae, aliis suci, aliis arbores, aliis causae, primumque id scire convenit, mutatam auctoritatem et saepius transisse gloriam. 

The names of unguents are due, some of them, to the original place of their composition, others, again, to the extracts which form their bases, others to the trees from which they are derived, and others to the peculiar circumstance under which they were first made: and it is as well, first of all, to know that in this respect the fashion has often changed, and that the high repute of peculiar kinds has been but transitory. 

laudatissimum fuit antiquitus in delo insula, postea mendesium. 

In ancient times, the perfumes the most esteemed of all were those of the island of Delos,8 and at a later period those of Mendes.9 

nec mixtura et compositione tantum hoc accidit, sed iidem suci varie alibi atque alibi praevaluere aut degeneravere. 

This degree of esteem is founded, not only on the mode of mixing them and the relative proportions, but according to the degree of favour or disfavour in which the various places which produce the ingredients are held, and the comparative excellence or degeneracy of the ingredients themselves. 

irinum corinthi diu maxime placuit, postea cyzici, 

The perfume of iris,10 from Corinth, was long held in the highest esteem, till that of Cyzicus came into fashion. 

simili modo rhodinum phaseli, quam gloriam abstulere neapolis, capua, praeneste. 

It was the same, too, with the perfume of roses,11 from Phaselis,12 the repute of which was afterwards eclipsed by those of Neapolis, Capua, and Præneste. 

crocinum in solis ciliciae diu maxime laudatum est, mox rhodi, 

Oil of saffron,13 from Soli in Cilicia, was for a long time held in repute beyond any other, and then that from Rhodes; 

oenanthinum in cypro, 

after which perfume of œnanthe,14 from Cyprus, came into fashion, 



and then that of Egypt was preferred. 

post adramytteo, amaracinum in coo, 

At a later period that of Adramytteum came into vogue, and then was supplanted by unguent of marjoram,15 from Cos, 

postea eodem loco praelatum est melinum, 

which in its turn was superseded by quince blossom16 unguent from the same place. 

cyprinum in cypro, deinde in aegypto, ubi mendesium et metopium subito gratius factum est. 

As to perfume of cyprus,17 that from the island of Cyprus was at first preferred, and then that of Egypt; when all on a sudden the unguents of Mendes and metopium18 rose into esteem. 

mox haec abstulit phoenice et cyprini laudem aegypto reliquit. 

In later times Phœnicia eclipsed Egypt in the manufacture of these last two, but left to that country the repute of producing the best unguent of cyprus.

panathenaicum suum athenae perseveranter optinuere. 

Athens has perseveringly maintained the repute of her panathenaicon.19 

fuerat et pardalium in tarso, cuius etiam conpositio et mixtura oblitterata est. 

There was formerly a famous unguent, known as "pardalium,"20 and made at Tarsus; at the present day its very composition and the mode of mixing it are quite unknown there: 

narcissinum quoque ex flore narcisso desiit conponi. 

they have left off, too, making unguent of narcissus21 from the flowers of that plant.

ratio faciendi duplex, sucus et corpus: 

There are two elements which enter into the composition of unguents, the juices and the solid parts. 

ille olei generibus fere constat, hoc odorum; 

The former generally consist of various kinds of oils, the latter of odoriferous substances. 

haec stymmata vocant, illa hedysmata. 

These last are known as hedysmata, while the oils are called stymmata.22 

tertius inter haec est colos multis neglectus; 

There is a third element, which occupies a place between the two, but has been much neglected, the colouring matter, namely. 

huius causa adduntur cinnabaris et anchusa. 

To produce a colour, however, cinnabar23 and alkanet24 are often employed. 

sal adspersus olei naturam coercet. 

If salt25 is sprinkled in the oil, it will aid it in retaining its properties; 

quibus anchusa adiecta est, sal non additur. 

but if alkanet has been employed, salt is never used. 

resina aut cummis adiciuntur ad continendum odorem in corpore; 

Resin and gum are added to fix the odour in the solid perfumes; 

celerrime is evanescit atque defluit, si non sunt haec addita. 

indeed it is apt to die away and disappear with the greatest rapidity if these substances are not employed.

unguentorum expeditissimum fuit primumque, ut verisimile est, e bryo et balanino oleo, de quibus supra diximus et increvit deinde mendesium balanino, resina, murra, magisque etiamnum metopium. oleum hoc est amygdalis amaris expressum in aegypto, cui addidere omphacium, cardamomum, iuncum, calamum, mel, vinum, murram, semen balsami, galbanum, resinam terebinthinam. 

The unguent which is the most readily prepared of all, and indeed, in all probability, the very first that was ever made, is that composed of bryon26 and oil of balanus,27 substances of which we have made mention already. In later times the Mendesian unguent was invented, a more complicated mixture, as resin and myrrh were added to oil of balanus, and at the present day they even add metopion28 as well, an Egyptian oil extracted from bitter almonds; to which have been added omphacium,29 cardamum,30 sweet rush,31 honey,32 wine, myrrh, seed of balsamum,33 galbanum,34 and resin of terebinth,35 as so many ingredients. 

e vilissimis quidem hodieque est - ob id creditum et id e vetustissimis esse - quod constat oleo myrteo, calamo, cupresso, cypro, lentisco, mali granati cortice. 

Among the most common unguents at the present day, and for that reason supposed to be the most ancient, is that composed of oil of myrtle,36 calamus, cypress,37 cyprus, mastich,38 and pomegranate-rind.39 

sed divulgata maxime unguenta crediderim rosa, quae plurima ubique gignitur. 

I am of opinion, however, that the unguents which have been the most universally adopted, are those which are compounded of the rose, a flower that grows everywhere; 

itaque simplicissima rhodini mixtura diu fuit additis omphacio, flore rosae, crocino, cinnabari, calamo, melle, iunco, salis flore aut anchusa, vino. 

and hence for a long time the composition of oil of roses was of the most simple nature, though more recently there have been added omphacium, rose blossoms, cinnabar, calamus, honey, sweet-rush, flour of salt or else alkanet,40 and wine. 

similis ratio et in crocino additis cinnabari, anchusa, vino. 

The same is the case, too, with oil of saffron, to which have been lately addedcinnabar, alkanet, and wine; 

similis et in sampsuchino admixtis omphacio, calamo. 

and with oil of sampsuchum,41 with which omphacium and calamus have been compounded. 

optimum hoc in cypro, mytilenis, ubi plurima sampsuchus. 

The best comes from Cyprus and Mitylene, where sampsuchum abounds in large quantities.

miscentur et viliora genera olei e myrto, lauru, quibus additur sampsuchum, lilium, faenum graecum, murra, casia, nardum, iuncus, cinnamomum. 

The commoner kinds of oil, too, are mixed with those of myrrh and laurel, to which are added sampsuchum, lilies, fenugreek, myrrh, cassia,42 nard,43 sweet-rush, and cinnamon.44 

e malis quoque cotoneis et strutheis fit oleum, ut dicemus, melinum, quod in unguenta transit admixtis omphacio, cyprino, sesamino, balsamo, iunco, casia, habrotono. susinum tenuissimum omnium est; 

There is an oil, too, made of the common quince and the sparrow quince, called melinum, as we shall have occasion to mention hereafter;45 it is used as an ingredient in unguents, mixed with omphacium, oil of cyprus, oil of sesamum,46 balsamum,47 sweet-rush, cassia, and abrotonum.48 Susinum49 is the most fluid of them all: 

constat ex liliis, balanino, calamo, melle, cinnamo, croco, murra; et dein cyprinum ex cypro et omphacio et cardamomo, calamo, aspalatho, habrotono; 

it is made of lilies, oil of balanus, calamus, honey, cinnamon, saffron,50 and myrrh; while the unguent of cyprus51 is compounded of cyprus, omphacium and cardamum, calamus, aspalathus,52 and abrotonum. 

aliqui et cyperum addunt et murram et panacem. 

There are some persons who, when making unguent of cyprus, employ myrrh also, and panax:53 

hoc optimum sidone, mox aegypto. 

the best is that made at Sidon, and the next best that of Egypt: 

si non addatur sesaminum oleum, durat et quadriennio; excitatur cinnamomo. 

care must be taken not to add oil of sesamum: it will keep as long as four years, and its odour is strengthened by the addition of cinnamon. 

telinum fit ex oleo recenti, cypiro, calamo, meliloto, faeno graeco, melle, maro, amaraco. 

Telinum54 is made of fresh olive-oil, cypirus,55 calamus, melilote,56 fenugreek, honey, marum,57 and sweet marjoram. 

hoc multo erat celeberrimum menandri poetae comici aetate; 

This last was the perfume most in vogue in the time of the Comic poet Menander: 

postea successit propter gloriam appellatum megalium, ex oleo balanino, calamo, iunco, xylobalsamo, casia, resina. 

a considerable time after that known as "megalium" took its place, being so called as holding the very highest rank;58 it was composed of oil of balanus, balsamum, calamus, sweet-rush, xylobalsamum,59 cassia, and resin. 

huius proprietas ut ventiletur in coquendo, donec desinat olere; 

One peculiar property of this unguent is, that it requires to be constantly stirred while boiling, until it has lost all smell: 

rursus refrigeratum odorem suum capit. 

when it becomes cold, it recovers its odour.60

singuli quoque suci nobilia unguenta faciunt: 

There are some single essences also which, individually, afford unguents of very high character: 

in primis malobathrum, postea iris illyrica et cyzicena amaracus, herbarum utraque. 

the first rank is due to malobathrum,61 and the next to the iris of Illyricum and the sweet marjoram of Cyzicus, both of them herbs. 

vel pauca his et alia alii miscent; 

There are perfumers who sometimes add some few other ingredients to these: 

qui plurima, alterutri mel, salis florem, omphacium, agni folia, panacem. 

those who use the most, employ for the purpose honey, flour of salt, omphacium, leaves of agnus,62 and panax, all of them foreign ingredients.63 

externa omnia et prodigiosa cinnamomino pretia: 

The price of unguent64 of cinnamon is quite enormous; 

adicitur cinnamo balaninum oleum, xylobalsamum, calamus, iunci, balsami semina, murra, mel odoratum. 

to cinnamon there is added oil of balanus, xylobalsamum, calamus, sweet-rush, seeds of balsamum, myrrh, and perfumed honey: 

unguentorum hoc crassissimum. 

it is the thickest in consistency of all the unguents; 

pretia ei a #1108 xxxv ad #1108 ccc. 

the price at which it sells ranges from thirty-five to three hundred denarii per pound. 

nardinum sive foliatum constat omphacio aut balanino, iunco, costo, nardo, amomo, murra, balsamo. 

Unguent of nard,65 or foliatum, is composed of omphacium or else oil of balanus, sweet-rush, costus,66 nard, amomum,67 myrrh, and balsamum.

in hoc genere conveniet meminisse herbarum, quae nardum indicum imitarentur, species viiii a nobis esse dictas: 

While speaking on this subject, it will be as well to bear in mind that there are nine different kinds of plants of a similar kind, of which we have already made mention68 as being employed for the purpose of imitating Indian nard; 

tanta materia adulterandi est. 

so abundant are the materials that are afforded for adulteration. 

omnia autem acutiora fiunt costo, amomo, quae maxime nares feriunt, crassiora murra suavioraque, medicinae autem utiliora croco, acerrima per se amomo; hoc et capitis dolores facit. 

All these perfumes are rendered still more pungent by the addition of costus and amomum, which have a particularly powerful effect on the olfactory organs; while myrrh gives them greater consistency and additional sweetness, and saffron makes them better adapted for medicinal purposes. They are most pungent, however, when mixed with amomum alone, which will often produce head-ache even. 

quidam satis habent adspergere quae sunt pretiosissima ceteris decoctis, inpendio parcentes, sed non est eadem vis nisi una decoctis. 

There are some persons who content themselves with sprinkling the more precious ingredients upon the others after boiling them down, for the purpose of economy; but the strength of the unguent is not so great as when the ingredients have been boiled together. 

murra et per se unguentum facit sine oleo, stacte dumtaxat, alioqui nimiam amaritudinem adfert. 

Myrrh used by itself, and without the mixture of oil, forms an unguent, but it is stacte69 only that must be used, for otherwise it will be productive of too great bitterness. 

cyprino viride fit, susino unguinosum, mendesio nigrum, rhodino candidum, murra pallidum. 

Unguent of cyprus turns other unguents green, while lily unguent70 makes them more unctuous: the unguent of Mendes turns them black, rose unguent makes them white, and that of myrrh of a pallid hue.

haec sunt antiquae inventionis genera et postea officinarum furta.

Such are the particulars of the ancient inventions, and the various falsifications of the shops in later times; 

we will now pass on to make mention of what is the very height of refinement in these articles of luxury, indeed, I may say, the beau ideal71 of them all. 72

(2.) This is what is called the "regal" unguent, from the fact that it is composed in these proportions for the kings of the Parthians. It consists of myrobalanus,73 costus, amomum, cinnamon, comacum,74 cardamum, spikenard, marum, myrrh, cassia, storax,75 ladanum,76 opobalsamum, Syrian calamus77 and Syrian sweet-rush,78 œnanthe, malobathrum, serichatum,79 cyprus, aspralathus, panax, saffron, cypirus, sweet marjoram, lotus,80 honey, and wine. Not one of the ingredients in this compound is produced either in Italy, that conqueror of the world, or, indeed, in all Europe, with the exception of the iris, which grows in Illyricum, and the nard, which is to be found in Gaul: as to the wine, the rose, the leaves of myrtle, and the olive-oil, they are possessed by pretty nearly all countries in common.

primus, quod exstet, ut equidem invenio, commentatus est de ea osthanes xerxen regem persarum bello, quod is graeciae intulit, comitatus ac velut semina artis portentosae sparsit obiter infecto, quacumque commeaverat, mundo. 

The first person, so far as I can ascertain, who wrote upon magic, and whose works are still in existence, was Osthanes,16 who accompanied Xerxes, the Persian king, in his expedition against Greece. It was he who first17 disseminated, as it were, the germs of this monstrous art, and tainted therewith all parts of the world through which the Persians passed. 

diligentiores paulo ante hunc ponunt zoroastren alium proconnensium. quod certum est, hic maxime osthanes ad rabiem, non aviditatem modo scientiae eius, graecorum populos egit. 

Authors who have made diligent enquiries into this subject, make mention of a second Zoroaster, a native of Proconnesus, as living a little before the time of Osthanes. That it was this same 'Osthanes, more particularly, that inspired the Greeks, not with a fondness only, but a rage, for the art of magic, is a fact beyond all doubt: 

quamquam animadverto summam litterarum claritatem gloriamque ex ea scientia antiquitus et paene semper petitam. 

though at the same time I would remark, that in the most ancient times, and indeed almost invariably, it was in this18 branch of science, that was sought the highest point of celebrity and of literary renown. 

certe pythagoras, empedocles, democritus, plato ad hanc discendam navigavere exiliis verius quam peregrinationibus susceptis, hanc reversi praedicavere, hanc in arcanis habuere. 

At all events, Pythagoras, we find, Empedocles, Democritus, and Plato, crossed the seas, in order to attain a knowledge thereof, submitting, to speak the truth, more to the evils of exile19 than to the mere inconveniences of travel. Returning home, it was upon the praises of this art that they expatiated—it was this that they held as one of their grandest mysteries. 

democritus apollobechen coptiten et dardanum e phoenice inlustravit voluminibus dardani in sepulchrum eius petitis, suis vero ex disciplina eorum editis. 

It was Democritus, too, who first drew attention to Apollobeches20 of Coptos, to Dardanus,21 and to Phœnix: the works of Dardanus he sought in the tomb of that personage, and his own were composed in accordance with the doctrines there found. 

quae recepta ab ullis hominum atque transisse per memoriam aeque ac nihil in vita mirandum est; 

That these doctrines should have been received by any portion of mankind, and transmitted to us by the aid of memory, is to me surprising beyond anything I can conceive.22 

in tantum fides istis fasque omne deest, adeo ut qui cetera in viro probant, haec opera eius esse infitientur. 

All the particulars there found are so utterly incredible, so utterly revolting, that those even who admire Democritus in other respects, are strong in their denial that these works were really written by him. 

sed frustra. 

Their denial, however, is in vain; 

hunc enim maxime adfixisse animis eam dulcedinem constat. 

for it was he, beyond all doubt, who had the greatest share in fascinating men's minds with these attractive chimeras.

artifices, qui compositis voluminibus condidere haec, miris laudibus celebrant telephanen phocaeum, ignotum alias, quoniam ... thessaliae habitaverit et ibi opera eius latuerint; 

The writers who compiled these volumes praise Telephanes of Phocaea with remarkable admiration, though he is otherwise unknown, because he lived in Thessaly and his works remained hidden there. 

alioqui suffragiis ipsorum aequatur polyclito, Myroni, pythagorae. 

Otherwise, according to their judgment, he is ranked equal to Polykleitos, Myron, and Pythagoras. 

laudant eius larisam et spintharum pentathlum et apollinem. 

They praise his statues of Larisa, Spintharus the pentathlete, and Apollo. 

alii non hanc ignobilitatis fuisse causam, sed quod se regum xerxis atque darei officinis dediderit, existimant.

Others believe that his obscurity was not due to this reason, but rather because he devoted himself to the workshops of the kings Xerxes and Darius.
