a taphris per continentem introrsus tenent auchetae, apud quos hypanis oritur, neuroe, apud quos borysthenes, geloni, thyssagetae, budini, basilidae et caeruleo capillo agathyrsi. 

Leaving Taphræ, and going along the mainland, we find in the interior the Auchetæ48, in whose country the Hypanis has its rise, as also the Neurœ, in whose district the Borysthenes has its source, the Geloni49, the Thyssagetæ, the Budini, the Basilidæ, and the Agathyrsi50 with their azure-coloured hair. 

super eos nomades, deinde anthropophagi, a buce vero super maeotim sauromatae et essedones. 

Above them are the Nomades, and then a nation of Anthropophagi or cannibals. On leaving Lake Buges, above the Lake Mæotis we come to the Sauromatæ and the Essedones51. 

at per oram ad tanain usque maeotae, a quibus lacus nomen accepit, ultimique a tergo eorum arimaspi. 

Along the coast, as far as the river Tanais52, are the Mæotæ, from whom the lake derives its name, and the last of all, in the rear of them, the Arimaspi. 

mox ripaei montes et adsiduo nivis casu pinnarum similitudine pterophoros appellata regio, pars mundi damnata a rerum natura et densa mersa caligine neque in alio quam rigoris opere gelidisque aquilonis conceptaculis.

We then come to the Riphæan53 mountains, and the region known by the name of Pterophoros54, because of the perpetual fall of snow there, the flakes of which resemble feathers; a part of the world which has been condemned by the decree of nature to lie immersed in thick darkness; suited for nothing but the generation of cold, and to be the asylum of the chilling blasts of the northern winds.

pone eos montes ultraque aquilonem gens felix, si credimus, quos hyperboreos appellavere, annoso degit aevo, fabulosis celebrata miraculis. 

Behind these mountains, and beyond the region of the northern winds, there dwells, if we choose to believe it, a happy race, known as the Hyperborei55, a race that lives to an extreme old age, and which has been the subject of many marvellous stories56. 

ibi creduntur esse cardines mundi extremique siderum ambitus semenstri luce et una die solis adversi, non, ut imperiti dixere, ab aequinoctio verno in autumnum: 

At this spot are supposed to be the hinges upon which the world revolves, and the extreme limits of the revolutions of the stars. Here we find light for six months together, given by the sun in one continuous day, who does not, however, as some ignorant persons have asserted, conceal himself from the vernal equinox57 to autumn. 

semel in anno solstitio oriuntur iis soles brumaque semel occidunt. 

On the contrary, to these people there is but one rising of the sun for the year, and that at the summer solstice, and but one setting, at the winter solstice. 

regio aprica, felici temperie, omni adflatu noxio carens. 

This region, warmed by the rays of the sun, is of a most delightful temperature, and exempt from every noxious blast. 

domus iis nemora lucique, et deorum cultus viritim gregatimque, discordia ignota et aegritudo omnis. 

The abodes of the natives are the woods and groves; the gods receive their worship singly and in groups, while all discord and every kind of sickness are things utterly unknown. 

mors non nisi satietate vitae epulatis delibutoque senio luxu e quadam rupe in mare salientibus; hoc genus sepulturae beatissimum. 

Death comes upon them only when satiated with life; after a career of feasting, in an old age sated with every luxury, they leap from a certain rock there into the sea; and this they deem the most desirable mode of ending existence. 

quidam eos in prima parte asiae litorum posuere, non in europa, quia sunt ibi similitudine et situs attacorum nomine. 

Some writers have placed these people, not in Europe, but at the very verge of the shores of Asia, because we find there a people called the Attacori58, who greatly resemble them and occupy a very similar locality. 

alii medios fecere eos inter utrumque solem, antipodum occasus exorientemque nostrum, quod fieri nullo modo potest tam vasto mari interveniente. 

Other writers again have placed them midway between the two suns, at the spot where it sets to the Antipodes and rises to us; a thing however that cannot possibly be, in consequence of the vast tract of sea which there intervenes. 

qui alibi quam in semenstri luce constituere eos, serere matutinis, meridie metere, occidente fetus arborum decerpere, noctibus in specus condi tradiderunt. 

Those writers who place them nowhere59 but under a day which lasts for six months, state that in the morning they sow, at mid-day they reap, at sunset they gather in the fruits of the trees, and during the night conceal themselves in caves. 

nec licet dubitare de gente ea: tot auctores produnt frugum primitias solitos delum mittere apollini, quem praecipue colunt. 

Nor are we at liberty to entertain any doubts as to the existence of this race; so many authors60 are there who assert that they were in the habit of sending their first-fruits to Delos to present them to Apollo, whom in especial they worship. 

virgines ferebant eas, hospitiis gentium per annos aliquot venerabiles, donec violata fide in proximis accolarum finibus deponere sacra ea instituere iique ad conterminos deferre atque ita delum usque. 

Virgins used to carry them, who for many years were held in high veneration, and received the rites of hospitality from the nations that lay on the route; until at last, in consequence of repeated violations of good faith, the Hyperboreans came to the determination to deposit these offerings upon the frontiers of the people who adjoined them, and they in their turn were to convey them on to their neighbours, and so from one to the other, till they should have arrived at Delos. 

However, this custom, even, in time fell into disuse.

mox et hoc ipsum exolevit. 

sarmatiae, scythiae, tauricae omnisque a borysthene amne tractus longitudo [dcccclxxx], latitudo [dccxvi] a m. agrippa tradita est. ego incertam in hac terrarum parte mensuram arbitror.

supra nasamonas confinesque illis machlyas androgynos esse utriusque naturae, inter se vicibus coeuntes, calliphanes tradit. aristoteles adicit dextram mammam iis virilem, laevam muliebrem esse. 

Above the Nasamones,21 and the Machlytæ, who border upon them, are found, as we learn from Calliphanes, the nation of the Androgyni, a people who unite the two sexes in the same individual, and alternately perform the functions of each. Aristotle also states, that their right breast is that of a male, the left that of a female.22

in eadem africa familias quasdam effascinantium isigonus et nymphodorus, quorum laudatione intereant probata, arescant arbores, emoriantur infantes. esse eiusdem generis in triballis et illyris adicit isigonus, qui visu quoque effascinent interemantque quos diutius intueantur, iratis praecipue oculis, quod eorum malum facilius sentire puberes;

Isigonus and Nymphodorus inform us that there are in Africa certain families of enchanters,23 who, by means of their charms, in the form of commendations, can cause cattle to perish, trees to wither, and infants to die. Isigonus adds, that there are among the Triballi and the Illyrii, some persons of this description, who also have the power of fascination with the eyes, and can even kill those on whom they fix their gaze for any length of time, more especially if their look denotes anger; the age of puberty is said to be particularly obnoxious to the malign influence of such persons.24

notabilius esse quod pupillas binas in oculis singulis habeant. huius generis et feminas in scythia, quae bitiae vocantur, prodit apollonides. phylarchus et in ponto thibiorum genus multosque alios eiusdem naturae, quorum notas tradit in altero oculo geminam pupillam, in altero equi effigiem; eosdem praeterea non posse mergi, ne veste quidem degravatos. haut dissimile iis genus pharmacum in aethiopia damon, quorum sudor tabem contactis corporibus afferat. feminas quidem omnes ubique visu nocere quae duplices pupillas habeant, cicero quoque apud nos auctor est. adeo naturae, cum ferarum morem vescendi humanis visceribus in homine genuisset, gignere etiam in toto corpore et in quorundam oculis quoque venena placuit, ne quid usquam mali esset quod in homine non esset.

A still more remarkable circumstance is, the fact that these persons have two pupils in each eye.25 Apollonides says, that there are certain females of this description in Scythia, who are known as Bythiæ, and Phylarchus states that a tribe of the Thibii in Pontus, and many other persons as well, have a double pupil in one eye, and in the other the figure of a horse.26 He also remarks, that the bodies of these persons will not sink in water,27 even though weighed down by their garments. Damon gives an account of a race of people, not very much unlike them, the Pharnaces of Æthiopia, whose perspiration is productive of consumption28 to the body of every person that it touches. Cicero also, one of our own writers, makes the remark, that the glances of all women who have a double pupil is noxious.29
