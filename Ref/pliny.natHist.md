supra nasamonas confinesque illis machlyas androgynos esse utriusque naturae, inter se vicibus coeuntes, calliphanes tradit. aristoteles adicit dextram mammam iis virilem, laevam muliebrem esse. 

Above the Nasamones,21 and the Machlytæ, who border upon them, are found, as we learn from Calliphanes, the nation of the Androgyni, a people who unite the two sexes in the same individual, and alternately perform the functions of each. Aristotle also states, that their right breast is that of a male, the left that of a female.22

in eadem africa familias quasdam effascinantium isigonus et nymphodorus, quorum laudatione intereant probata, arescant arbores, emoriantur infantes. esse eiusdem generis in triballis et illyris adicit isigonus, qui visu quoque effascinent interemantque quos diutius intueantur, iratis praecipue oculis, quod eorum malum facilius sentire puberes;

Isigonus and Nymphodorus inform us that there are in Africa certain families of enchanters,23 who, by means of their charms, in the form of commendations, can cause cattle to perish, trees to wither, and infants to die. Isigonus adds, that there are among the Triballi and the Illyrii, some persons of this description, who also have the power of fascination with the eyes, and can even kill those on whom they fix their gaze for any length of time, more especially if their look denotes anger; the age of puberty is said to be particularly obnoxious to the malign influence of such persons.24

notabilius esse quod pupillas binas in oculis singulis habeant. huius generis et feminas in scythia, quae bitiae vocantur, prodit apollonides. phylarchus et in ponto thibiorum genus multosque alios eiusdem naturae, quorum notas tradit in altero oculo geminam pupillam, in altero equi effigiem; eosdem praeterea non posse mergi, ne veste quidem degravatos. haut dissimile iis genus pharmacum in aethiopia damon, quorum sudor tabem contactis corporibus afferat. feminas quidem omnes ubique visu nocere quae duplices pupillas habeant, cicero quoque apud nos auctor est. adeo naturae, cum ferarum morem vescendi humanis visceribus in homine genuisset, gignere etiam in toto corpore et in quorundam oculis quoque venena placuit, ne quid usquam mali esset quod in homine non esset.

A still more remarkable circumstance is, the fact that these persons have two pupils in each eye.25 Apollonides says, that there are certain females of this description in Scythia, who are known as Bythiæ, and Phylarchus states that a tribe of the Thibii in Pontus, and many other persons as well, have a double pupil in one eye, and in the other the figure of a horse.26 He also remarks, that the bodies of these persons will not sink in water,27 even though weighed down by their garments. Damon gives an account of a race of people, not very much unlike them, the Pharnaces of Æthiopia, whose perspiration is productive of consumption28 to the body of every person that it touches. Cicero also, one of our own writers, makes the remark, that the glances of all women who have a double pupil is noxious.29
