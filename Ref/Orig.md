Τὰ δὲ περὶ τῆς εἰδωλολατρείας ὡς ἴδια τῶν ἀπὸ τοῦ λόγου ἐκτιθέμενος καὶ ὑποκατασκευάζει λέγων αὐτοὺς διὰ τοῦτο μὴ νομίζειν αὐτοὺς χειροποιήτους θεοὺς, ἐπεὶ μὴ εὔλογόν ἐστι τὰ ὑπὸ φαυλοτάτων δημιουργῶν καὶ μοχθηρῶν

τὸ ἦθος εἰργασμένα εἶναι θεοὺς, πολλάκις καὶ ὑπὸ ἀδίκων ἀνθρώπων
324
κατασκευασθέντα. 

Treating of the regulations respecting idolatry as being peculiar to Christianity, Celsus establishes their correctness, saying that the Christians do not consider those to be gods that are made with hands, On the ground that it is not in conformity with right reason (to suppose) that images, fashioned by the most worthless and depraved of workmen, and in many instances also provided by wicked men, can be (regarded as) gods. 

ἐν τοῖς ἑξῆς οὖν θέλων αὐτὸ κοινοποιῆσαι ὡς οὐ πρῶτον ὑπὸ τούτου εὑρεθὲν ἐκτίθεται Ἡρακλείτου λέξιν τὴν λέγουσαν· 

In what follows, however, wishing to show that this is a common opinion, and one not first discovered by Christianity, he quotes a saying of Heraclitus to this effect: 

„ὅμοια, ὡς εἴ τις τοῖς δόμοις λεσχηνεύοιτο, ποιεῖν τοὺς προσιόντας ὡς θεοῖς τοῖς ἀψύχοις.“ 

"That those who draw near to lifeless images, as if they were gods, act in a similar manner to those who would enter into conversation with houses." 

οὐκοῦν καὶ περὶ τούτου λεκτέον ὅτι ὁμοίως τῷ ἄλλῳ ἠθικῷ τόπῳ ἐγκατεσπάρησαν τοῖς ἀνθρώποις ἔννοιαι, ἀφ ὧν καὶ ὁ Ἡράκλειτος καὶ εἴ τις
v.1.p.59
ἄλλος Ἑλλήνων ἢ βαρβάρων τοῦτ ἐνενόησε κατασκευάσαι. 

Respecting this, then, we have to say, that ideas were implanted in the minds of men like the principles of morality, from which not only Heraclitus, but any other Greek or barbarian, might by reflection have deduced the same conclusion; 

ἐκτίθεται γὰρ καὶ Πέρσας τοῦτο φρονοῦντας, παρατιθέμενος Ἡρόδοτον ἱστοροῦντα αὐτό. 

for he states that the Persians also were of the same opinion, quoting Herodotus as his authority. 

προσθήσομεν δὲ καὶ ἡμεῖς ὅτι καὶ Ζήνων ὁ Κιτιεὺς ἐν τῇ Πολιτείᾳ φησίν· „ἱερά τε οἰκοδομεῖν οὐδὲν δεήσει· ἱερὸν γὰρ οὐδὲν χρὴ νομίζειν οὐδὲ πολλοῦ ἄξιον καὶ ἅγιον, οἰκοδόμων τε ἔργον καὶ βαναύσων.“ 

We also can add to these Zeno of Citium, who in his Polity, says: "And there will be no need to build temples, for nothing ought to be regarded as sacred, or of much value, or holy, which is the work of builders and of mean men." 

σαφὲς οὖν ὅτι καὶ περὶ τούτου τοῦ δόγματος γέγραπται „ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις“ τῶν ἀνθρώπων γράμμασι θεοῦ τὸ πρακτέον.

It is evident, then, with respect to this opinion (as well as others), that there has been en-graven upon the hearts of men by the finger of God a sense of the duty that is required.

16. 
Θαυμάζω δέ, πῶς Ὀδρύσας μὲν καὶ Σαμόθρᾳκας καὶ Ἐλευσινίους καὶ Ὑπερβορέους ἐν τοῖς ἀρχαιοτάτοις καὶ σοφωτάτοις ἔταξεν ἔθνεσιν ὁ Κέλσος, τοὺς δὲ Ἰουδαίους οὐκ ἠξίωσεν οὔτε εἰς σοφοὺς παραδέξασθαι οὔτε εἰς ἀρχαίους· πολλῶν φερομένων συγγραμμάτων παρὰ Αἰγυπτίοις καὶ Φοίνιξι καὶ Ἕλλησι, μαρτυρούντων αὐτῶν τῇ ἀρχαιότητι, ἅπερ ἐγὼ περισσὸν ἡγησάμην εἶναι παραθέσθαι. 

I must express my surprise that Celsus should class the Odrysians, and Samothracians, and Eleusinians, and Hyperboreans among the most ancient and learned nations, and should not deem the Jews worthy of a place among such, either for their learning or their antiquity, although there are many treatises in circulation among the Egyptians, and Phoenicians, and Greeks, which testify to their existence as an ancient people, but which I have considered it unnecessary to quote. 

Δυνατὸν γὰρ τὸν βουλόμενον ἀναγνῶναι τὰ γεγραμμένα Φλαυίῳ Ἰωσήπῳ περὶ τῆς τῶν Ἰουδαίων ἀρχαιότητος ἐν δυσίν, ὅπου πολλὴν συναγωγὴν συγγραφέων φέρει μαρτυρούντων τῇ Ἰουδαίων ἀρχαιότητι. 

For any one who chooses may read what Florins Josephus has recorded in his two books, On the Antiquity, of the Jews, where he brings together a great collection of writers, who bear witness to the antiquity of the Jewish people; 

Καὶ Τατιανοῦ δὲ νεωτέρου φέρεται ὁ πρὸς Ἕλληνας λόγος, πολυμαθέστατα ἐκτιθεμένου τοὺς ἱστορήσαντας περὶ τῆς Ἰουδαίων καὶ Μωϋσέως ἀρχαιότητος. 

and there exists the Discourse to the Greeks of Tatian the younger, in which with very great learning he enumerates those historians who have treated of the antiquity of the Jewish nation and of Moses. 

Ἔοικεν οὖν οὐκ ἀληθῶς ἀλλὰ φιλαπεχθημόνως ὁ Κέλσος ταῦτα λέγειν, σκοπὸν ἔχων κατηγορῆσαι τῆς ἀρχῆς τοῦ χριστιανισμοῦ, ἠρτημένης ἀπὸ Ἰουδαίων. 

It seems, then, to be not from a love of truth, but from a spirit of hatred, that Celsus makes these statements, his object being to asperse the origin of Christianity, which is connected with Judaism. 

Ἀλλὰ καὶ τοὺς μὲν Ὁμήρου Γαλακτοφάγους καὶ τοὺς Γαλατῶν Δρυΐδας καὶ τοὺς Γέτας σοφώτατα λέγει ἔθνη εἶναι καὶ ἀρχαῖα, περὶ τῶν συγγενῶν τοῖς ἰουδαϊκοῖς λόγοις διαλαμβάνοντας, ὧν οὐκ οἶδα εἰ φέρεται συγγράμματα· 

Nay, he styles the Galactophagi of Homer, and the Druids of the Gauls, and the Getae, most learned and ancient tribes, on account of the resemblance between their traditions and those of the Jews, although I know not whether any of their histories survive; 

Ἑβραίους δὲ μόνον τὸ ὅσον ἐφ' ἑαυτῷ ἐκβάλλει καὶ τῆς ἀρχαιότητος καὶ τῆς σοφίας.

but the Hebrews alone, as far as in him lies, he deprives of the honour both of antiquity and learning. 

Πάλιν τε αὖ κατάλογον ποιούμενος ἀνδρῶν ἀρχαίων καὶ σοφῶν, ὠφελησάντων τοὺς κατ' αὐτοὺς καὶ διὰ συγγραμμάτων τοὺς μετ' αὐτούς, Μωϋσέα ἐξέβαλε τοῦ καταλόγου τῶν σοφῶν. 

And again, when making a list of ancient and learned men who have conferred benefits upon their contemporaries (by their deeds), and upon posterity by their writings, he excluded Moses from the number; 

Καὶ Λίνου μέν, ὃν προέταξεν ὧν ὠνόμασεν ὁ Κέλσος, οὔτε νόμοι οὔτε λόγοι φέρονται ἐπιστρέψαντες καὶ θεραπεύσαντες ἔθνη· Μωϋσέως δὲ τοὺς νόμους ὅλον ἔθνος φέρει ἐπεσπαρμένον τῇ πάσῃ οἰκουμένῃ. 

while of Linus, to whom Celsus assigns a foremost place in his list, there exists neither laws nor discourses which produced a change for the better among any tribes; whereas a whole nation, dispersed throughout the entire world, obey the laws of Moses. 

Ὅρα οὖν εἰ μὴ ἄντικρυς κακουργῶν ἐξέβαλε τοῦ καταλόγου τῶν σοφῶν καὶ Μωϋσέα, Λίνον δὲ καὶ Μουσαῖον καὶ Ὀρφέα καὶ τὸν Φερεκύδην καὶ τὸν Πέρσην Ζωροάστρην καὶ Πυθαγόραν φήσας περὶ τῶνδε διειληφέναι, καὶ ἐς βίβλους κατατεθεῖσθαι τὰ ἑαυτῶν δόγματα καὶ πεφυλάχθαι αὐτὰ μέχρι δεῦρο.

Consider, then, whether it is not from open malevolence that he has expelled Moses from his catalogue of learned men, while asserting that Linus, and Musaeus, and Orpheus, and Pherecydes, and the Persian Zoroaster, and Pythagoras, discussed these topics, and that their opinions were deposited in books, and have thus been preserved down to the present time. 

And it is intentionally also that he has omitted to take notice of the myth, embellished chiefly by Orpheus, in which the gods are described as affected by human weaknesses and passions.

### c17 
Καὶ ἑκὼν μὲν ἐπελάθετο τοῦ περὶ τῶν νομιζομένων θεῶν μύθου ὡς ἀνθρωποπαθῶν, ἀναγεγραμμένου μάλιστα ὑπὸ Ὀρφέως, ἐν δὲ τοῖς ἑξῆς κατηγορῶν τῆς Μωϋσέως ἱστορίας αἰτιᾶται τοὺς τροπολογοῦντας καὶ ἀλληγοροῦντας αὐτήν. 

In what follows, Celsus, assailing the Mosaic history, finds fault with those who give it a tropical and allegorical signification. 

Ἦν δ' ἂν εἰπεῖν πρὸς τὸν γενναιότατον καὶ ἀληθῆ λόγον ἐπιγράψαντα τὸ ἑαυτοῦ βιβλίον, 

And here one might say to this great man, who inscribed upon his own work the title of a True Discourse,

τί δήποτε, ὦ οὗτος, θεοὺς μὲν τηλικαύταις περιπίπτοντας συμφοραῖς, ὁποίας ἀναγράφουσιν οἱ σοφοί σου ποιηταὶ καὶ φιλόσοφοι, καὶ ἐναγέσι μίξεσι χρωμένους [καὶ κατὰ τῶν πατέρων στρατευομένους καὶ τὰ αἰδοῖα αὐτῶν ἀποτέμνοντας σεμνολογεῖς ἀναγεγράφθαι τὰ τηλικαῦτα τετολμηκέναι καὶ πεποιηκέναι καὶ πεπονθέναι· 

"Why, good sir, do you make it a boast to have it recorded that the gods should engage in such adventures as are described by your learned poets and philosophers, and be guilty of abominable intrigues, and of engaging in wars against their own fathers, and of cutting off their secret parts, and should dare to commit and to suffer such enormities; 

ὅταν δὲ Μωϋσῆς μὴ περὶ θεοῦ τοιαῦτα λέγῃ ἀλλὰ μηδ' ἀγγέλων ἁγίων περὶ δὲ ἀνθρώπων πολλῷ ἐλάττονα – οὐδεὶς γὰρ παρ' αὐτῷ ἐτόλμησεν ὅσα Κρόνος κατὰ τοῦ Οὐρανοῦ οὐδ' ὅσα Ζεὺς κατὰ τοῦ πατρός, οὐδ' ὅτι τῇ ἑαυτοῦ θυγατρὶ ὁ «πατὴρ ἀνδρῶν τε θεῶν τε» συνελήλυθεν – , πλανᾶν νομίζεται ἠπατημένους τοὺς νενομοθετημένους ὑπ' αὐτοῦ;] 

while Moses, who gives no such accounts respecting God, nor even regarding the holy angels, and who relates deeds of far less atrocity regarding men (for in his writings no one ever ventured to commit such crimes as Kronos did against Uranus, or Zeus against his father, or that of the father of men and gods, who had intercourse with his own daughter), should be considered as having deceived those who were placed under his laws, and to have led them into error?" 

Δοκεῖ δέ μοι καὶ παραπλήσιόν τι Κέλσος ποιεῖν τῷ πλατωνικῷ Θρασυμάχῳ, μὴ ἐπιτρέποντι ὡς βούλεται ἀποκρίνασθαι περὶ τῆς δικαιοσύνης Σωκράτει ἀλλὰ λέγοντι· Ὅρα μὴ τὸ συμφέρον εἴπῃς εἶναι τὸ δίκαιον μηδὲ τὸ δέον μηδ' ἄλλο τι τῶν παραπλησίων. 

And here Celsus seems to me to act somewhat as Thrasymachns the Platonic philosopher did, when he would not allow Socrates to answer regarding justice, as he wished, but said, "Take care not to say that utility is justice, or duty, or anything of that kind." 

Καὶ γὰρ οὗτος κατηγορήσας, ὡς οἴεται, τῶν παρὰ Μωϋσεῖ [ἱστοριῶν] καὶ μεμψάμενος τοῖς ἀλληγοροῦσι μετὰ τοῦ καὶ ἔπαινόν τινα περὶ αὐτῶν λέγειν, ὅτι εἰσὶν οἱ ἐπιεικέστεροι, οἱονεὶ κωλύει κατηγορήσας, ὡς βούλεται, ἀπολογεῖσθαι τοὺς δυναμένους, ὡς πέφυκεν ἔχειν τὰ πράγματα.

For in like manner Celsus as sails (as he thinks) the Mosaic histories, and finds fault with those who understand them allegorically, at the same time bestowing also some praise upon those who do so, to the effect that they are more impartial (than those who do not); and thus, as it were, he prevents by his cavils those who are able to show the true state of the case from offering such a defence as they would wish to offer.
### c18
Εἴποιμεν δ' ἂν προκαλούμενοι βίβλους βίβλοις παραβάλλεσθαι ὅτι φέρε, ὦ οὗτος, τὰ Λίνου καὶ Μουσαίου καὶ Ὀρφέως ποιήματα καὶ Φερεκύδου τὴν γραφὴν καὶ συνεξέταζε τοῖς Μωϋσέως νόμοις, ἱστορίας ἱστορίαις καὶ ἠθικοὺς λόγους νόμοις καὶ προστάγμασι παρατιθείς· 

And challenging a comparison of book with book, I would say, "Come now, good sir, take down the poems of Linus, and of Musaeus, and of Orpheus, and the writings of Pherecydes, and carefully compare these with the laws of Moses--histories with histories, and ethical discourses with laws and commandments--

καὶ ὅρα ὁποῖα μᾶλλον ἐπιστρέψαι δύναται καὶ αὐτόθεν τοὺς ἀκούοντας, καὶ τίνα αὐτῶν κἂν ἐπιτρῖψαι τὸν ἀκροατήν· 

and see which of the two are the better fitted to change the character of the hearer on the very spot, and which to harden him in his wickedness; 

καὶ κατανόει ὅπως τὸ μὲν τάγμα τῶν σῶν συγγραφέων ὀλίγον μὲν ἐφρόντισε τῶν αὐτόθεν ἐντευξομένων, μόνοις δὲ ἄρα τοῖς τροπολογῆσαι καὶ ἀλληγορῆσαι δυναμένοις ἔγραψε τὴν ἰδίαν, ὡς φῄς, φιλοσοφίαν. 

and observe that your series of writers display little concern for those readers who are to peruse them at once unaided, but have composed their philosophy (as you term it) for those who are able to comprehend its metaphorical and allegorical signification; 

Ὁ δὲ Μωϋσῆς ἀνάλογον γενναίῳ ῥήτορι σχῆμα μελετῶντι καὶ πανταχοῦ τὴν διπλόην τῆς λέξεως πεφυλαγμένως προφερομένῳ ἐπὶ τῶν πέντε βιβλίων πεποίηκε, μήτε τῷ πλήθει τῶν νομοθετουμένων Ἰουδαίων διδοὺς ἀφορμὰς βλάβης ἐν τῷ ἠθικῷ τόπῳ, μήτε τοῖς ὀλίγοις καὶ συνετώτερον ἐντυγχάνειν δυναμένοις οὐχὶ πλήρη θεωρίας ἐκτιθέμενος, τοῖς ἐρευνᾶν τὸ βούλημα αὐτοῦ δυναμένοις, γραφήν. 

whereas Moses, like a distinguished orator who meditates some figure of Rhetoric, and who carefully introduces in every part language of twofold meaning, has done this in his five books: neither affording, in the portion which relates to morals, any handle to his Jewish subjects for committing evil; nor yet giving to the few individuals who were endowed with greater wisdom, and who were capable of investigating his meaning, a treatise devoid of material for speculation. 

Καὶ τῶν μὲν σοφῶν σου ποιητῶν ἔοικε μηδὲ τὰ βιβλία ἔτι σῴζεσθαι, φυλαχθέντα ἄν, εἰ ὁ ἐντυγχάνων ᾔσθετο ὠφελείας· τοῦ δὲ Μωϋσέως τὰ γράμματα πολλοὺς καὶ τῶν ἀλλοτρίων τῆς παρὰ Ἰουδαίοις ἀναστροφῆς κεκίνηκε πιστεῦσαι, ὅτι κατὰ τὴν ἐπαγγελίαν τῶν γραμμάτων ὁ πρῶτος αὐτὰ νομοθετήσας καὶ Μωϋσεῖ παραδοὺς θεὸς ὁ κτίσας τὸν κόσμον ἦν. 

But of your learned poets the very writings would seem no longer to be preserved, although they would have been carefully treasured up if the readers had perceived any benefit (likely to be derived from them); whereas the works of Moses have stirred up many, who were even aliens to the manners of the Jews, to the belief that, as these writings testify, the first who enacted these laws and delivered them to Moses, was the God who was the Creator of the world. 

Καὶ γὰρ ἔπρεπε τὸν ὅλου τοῦ κόσμου δημιουργόν, νόμους τεθειμένον ὅλῳ τῷ κόσμῳ, δύναμιν παρασχεῖν τοῖς λόγοις, κρατῆσαι τῶν πανταχοῦ δυναμένην. 

For it became the Creator of the universe, after laying down laws for its government, to confer upon His words a power which might subdue all men in every part of the earth. 

Καὶ ταῦτά φημι οὐδέπω περὶ τοῦ Ἰησοῦ ἐξετάζων ἀλλ' ἔτι Μωϋσέα, τὸν πολλῷ ἐλάττονα κυρίου, δεικνύς, ὡς ὁ λόγος παραστήσει, πολλῷ διαφέροντα τῶν σοφῶν σου ποιητῶν καὶ φιλοσόφων.

And this I maintain, having as yet entered into no investigation regarding Jesus, but still demonstrating that Moses, who is far inferior to the Lord, is, as the Discourse will show, greatly superior to your wise poets and philosophers.
### c23
Ἑξῆς τούτοις φησὶν ὁ Κέλσος ὅτι _τῷ ἡγησαμένῳ σφῶν \[ἑπόμενοι Μωϋσεῖ αἰπόλοι καὶ ποιμένες\], ἀγροίκοις ἀπάταις ψυχαγωγηθέντες_ \[_ἕνα ἐνόμισαν εἶναι θεόν._ 

After this, Celsus next asserts that "Those herdsmen and shepherds who followed Moses as their leader, had their minds deluded by vulgar deceits, and so supposed that there was one God." 

Δεικνύτω\] τοίνυν πῶς, _αἰπόλων καὶ ποιμένων ἀλόγως,_ ὡς οἴεται, _ἀποστάντων τοῦ σέβειν θεούς,_ αὐτὸς δύναται παραστῆσαι \[τὸ πλῆθος τῶν καθ' Ἕλληνας θεῶν\] ἢ τοὺς λοιποὺς βαρβάρους. 

Let him show, then, how, after this irrational departure, as he regards it, of the herdsmen and shepherds from the worship of many gods, he himself is able to establish the multiplicity of deities that are found amongst the Greeks, or among those other nations that are called Barbarian. 

[Δεικνύτω τοίνυν ὑπόστασιν καὶ οὐσίαν Μνημοσύνης γεννώσης ἀπὸ Διὸς τὰς Μούσας, ἢ Θέμιδος τὰς Ὥρας, 

Let him establish, therefore, the existence of Mnemosyne, the mother of the Muses by Zeus; or of Themis, the parent of the Hours; 

ἢ τὰς Χάριτας ἀεὶ γυμνὰς παραστησάτω δύνασθαι κατ' οὐσίαν ὑφεστηκέναι.] 

or let him prove that the ever naked Graces can have a real, substantial existence. 

Ἀλλ' οὐ δυνήσεται τὰ Ἑλλήνων ἀναπλάσματα σωματοποιεῖσθαι δοκοῦντα ἀπὸ τῶν πραγμάτων δεικνύναι θεούς. 

But he will not be able to show, from any actions of theirs, that these fictitious representations of the Greeks, which have the appearance of being invested with bodies, are (really) gods. 

Τί γὰρ μᾶλλον οἱ Ἑλλήνων μῦθοι περὶ θεῶν ἀληθεῖς ἤ, φέρ' εἰπεῖν, οἱ Αἰγυπτίων, οὐκ εἰδότων τῇ σφῶν διαλέκτῳ \[Μνημοσύνην μητέρα Μουσῶν ἐννέα οὐδὲ Θέμιν Ὡρῶν οὐδὲ Εὐρυνόμην μαῖαν τῶν Χαρίτων\] οὐδὲ τὰ λοιπὰ ὀνόματα αὐτῶν; 

And why should the fables of the Greeks regarding the gods be true, any more than those of the Egyptians for example, who in their language know nothing of a Mnemosyne, mother of the nine Muses; nor of a Themis, parent of the Hours; nor of a Euphrosyne, one of the Graces; nor of any other of these names? 

\[Πόσῳ οὖν ἐνεργέστερον\] καὶ πάντων τούτων τῶν ἀναπλασμάτων βέλτιον τὸ ἐκ τῶν ὁρωμένων \[πειθόμενον τοῖς κατὰ τὴν εὐταξίαν τοῦ κόσμου σέβειν τὸν δημιουργὸν αὐτοῦ ἑνὸς ὄντος ἕνα καὶ συμπνέοντος αὐτοῦ ὅλῳ ἑαυτῷ καὶ διὰ τοῦτο μὴ δυναμένῳ ὑπὸ πολλῶν δημιουργῶν γεγονέναι, 

How much more manifest (and how much better than all these inventions!) is it that, convinced by what we see, in the admirable order of the world, we should worship the Maker of it as the one Author of one effect, and which, as being wholly in harmony with itself, cannot on that account have been the work of many makers; 

ὡς οὐδ' ὑπὸ πολλῶν ψυχῶν συνέχεσθαι ὅλον τὸν οὐρανὸν κινουσῶν· ἀρκεῖ γὰρ μία ἡ φέρουσα ὅλην τὴν ἀπλανῆ ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν ἐπὶ δυσμὰς καὶ ἐμπεριλαβοῦσα ἔνδον πάντα, ὧν χρείαν ἔχει ὁ κόσμος, τὰ μὴ αὐτοτελῆ. 

and that we should believe that the whole heaven is not held together by the movements of many souls, for one is enough, which bears the whole of the non-wandering sphere from east to west, and embraces within it all things which the world requires, and which are not self-existing! 

Πάντα γὰρ μέρη κόσμου, οὐδὲν δὲ μέρος ὅλου θεός· 

For all are parts of the world, while God is no part of the whole. 

δεῖ γὰρ εἶναι τὸν θεὸν μὴ ἀτελῆ, ὥσπερ ἐστὶ τὸ μέρος ἀτελές. 

But God cannot be imperfect, as a part is imperfect. 

Τάχα δὲ βαθύτερος λόγος δείξει ὅτι κυρίως θεὸς ὥσπερ οὐκ ἔστι μέρος οὕτως οὐδὲ ὅλον, ἐπεὶ τὸ ὅλον ἐκ μερῶν ἐστι· 

And perhaps profounder consideration will show, that as God is not a part, so neither is He properly the whole, since the whole is composed of parts; 

καὶ οὐχ αἱρεῖ λόγος παραδέξασθαι τὸν ἐπὶ πᾶσι θεὸν εἶναι ἐκ μερῶν, ὧν ἕκαστον οὐ δύναται ὅπερ τὰ ἄλλα μέρη.\]

and reason will not allow us to believe that the God who is over all is composed of parts, each one of which cannot do what all the other parts, can.

Ἐχρῆν οὖν τὸν Κέλσον, διὰ τῶν προκειμένων βουλόμενον θειότερα καὶ σοφώτερα ἀποδεῖξαι τὰ ἄλογα ζῷα τῶν ἀνθρώπων, κατασκευάσαι διὰ πλειόνων ὡς ὑπάρχουσαν τὴν τοιάνδε μαντικὴν καὶ τὴν ἀπολογίαν μετὰ τοῦτ' ἐναργεστέρως ἀποδεῖξαι καὶ ἀποδεικτικῶς ἀποδοκιμάσαι μὲν τοὺς λόγους τῶν ἀναιρούντων τὰς τοιασδὶ μαντείας ἀποδεικτικῶς δ' ἀνατρέψαι καὶ τοὺς λόγους τῶν εἰπόντων ἀπὸ δαιμόνων ἢ θεῶν γίνεσθαι τὰς κινήσεις τοῖς ζῴοις πρὸς τὸ μαντεύσασθαι καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα κατασκευάσαι περὶ τῆς τῶν ἀλόγων ζῴων ψυχῆς ὡς θειοτέρας. 

Celsus, however, seeing he wished to prove by the foregoing statements that the irrational animals are more divine and intelligent than human beings, ought to have established at greater length the actual existence of such an art of divination, and in the next place have energetically undertaken its defence, and effectually refuted the arguments of those who would annihilate such arts of divination, and have overturned in a convincing manner also the arguments of those who say that it is from demons or from gods that animals receive the movements which lead them to divination, and to have proved in the next place that the soul of irrational animals is more divine than that of man. 

Οὕτω γὰρ ἂν πρὸς τὰ πιθανὰ αὐτοῦ, ἐπιδειξαμένου φιλόσοφον περὶ τῶν τηλικούτων ἕξιν, κατὰ τὸ δυνατὸν ἡμῖν ἐνέστημεν· ἀνατρέποντες μὲν τὸ ὅτι σοφώτερα τὰ ἄλογα ζῷα τῶν ἀνθρώπων, ψευδοποιοῦντες δὲ καὶ ὅτι ἐννοίας ἔχει τοῦ θείου ἱερωτέρας ἡμῶν καὶ ὅτι ὁμιλίας ἔχει πρὸς ἄλληλα ἱεράς τινας. 

For, had he done so, and manifested a philosophical spirit in dealing with such things, we should to the best of our power have met his confident assertions, refuting in the first place the allegation that irrational animals are wiser than men, and showing the falsity of the statement that they have ideas of God more sacred than ours, and that they hold among themselves certain sacred assemblies. 

Νυνὶ δ' ὁ ἐγκαλῶν ἡμῖν ὅτι πιστεύομεν τῷ ἐπὶ πᾶσι θεῷ ἀξιοῖ ἡμᾶς πιστεύειν ὅτι αἱ ψυχαὶ τῶν ὀρνίθων θειοτέρας ἔχουσιν ἐννοίας καὶ τρανοτέρας ἀνθρώπων. 

But now, on the contrary, he who accuses us because we believe in the Supreme God, requires us to believe that the souls of birds entertain ideas of God more divine and distinct than those of men. 

Ὅπερ εἰ ἀληθές ἐστιν, ὄρνιθες μᾶλλον τρανοτέρας Κέλσου ἔχουσι περὶ θεοῦ ἐννοίας· καὶ οὐ θαυμαστὸν εἰ Κέλσου, τοῦ ἐπὶ τοσοῦτον τὸν ἄνθρωπον ἐξευτελίζοντος. 

Yet if this is true, the birds have clearer ideas of God than Celsus himself; and it is not matter of surprise that it should be so with him, who so greatly depreciates human beings. 

Ἀλλὰ γὰρ ὅσον ἐπὶ Κέλσῳ οἱ ὄρνιθες μείζονας καὶ θειοτέρας ἔχουσιν ἐννοίας οὐ λέγω ἡμῶν Χριστιανῶν ἢ τῶν ταῖς αὐταῖς ἡμῖν γραφαῖς χρωμένων Ἰουδαίων ἀλλὰ γὰρ καὶ τῶν παρ' Ἕλλησι θεολόγων· ἄνθρωποι γὰρ ἦσαν. 

Nay, so far as Celsus can make it appear, the birds possess grander and more divine ideas than, I do not say we Christians do, or than the Jews, who use the same Scriptures with ourselves, but even than are possessed by the theologians among the Greeks, for they were only human beings. 

Μᾶλλον οὖν κατὰ Κέλσον κατείληφε τὴν τοῦ θείου φύσιν τὸ τῶν δῆθεν μαντικῶν ὀρνίθων γένος ἢ Φερεκύδης καὶ Πυθαγόρας καὶ Σωκράτης καὶ Πλάτων. 

According to Celsus, indeed, the tribe of birds that practise divination, forsooth, understand the nature of the Divine Being better than Pherecydes, and Pythagoras, and Socrates and Plato! 

Καὶ ἐχρῆν γε ἡμᾶς πρὸς τοὺς ὄρνιθας φοιτᾶν διδασκάλους· ἵν' ὥσπερ κατὰ τὴν Κέλσου ὑπόληψιν διδάσκουσιν ἡμᾶς μαντικῶς τὰ ἐσόμενα, οὕτω καὶ τοῦ ἀμφιβάλλειν περὶ τοῦ θείου ἀπαλλάξωσι τοὺς ἀνθρώπους, ἣν κατειλήφασι τρανὴν περὶ αὐτοῦ ἔννοιαν παραδιδόντες.

We ought then to go to the birds as our teachers, in order that as, according to the view of Celsus, they instruct us by their power of divination in the knowledge of future events, so also they may free men from doubts regarding the Divine Being, by imparting to them the clear ideas which they have obtained respecting Him! It follows, accordingly, that Celsus, who regards birds as superior to men, ought to employ them as his instructors, and not one of the Greek philosophers.

### c97

Πῶς δ' ἀσεβῶς ὑπὸ τοῦ ἀσέβειαν ἡμῖν ἐγκαλοῦντος εἴρηται τὸ οὐ μόνον σοφώτερα εἶναι τὰ ἄλογα τῶν ζῴων τῆς τῶν ἀνθρώπων φύσεως ἀλλὰ καὶ θεοφιλέστερα; Καὶ τίς οὐκ ἂν ἀποτραπείη προσέχων ἀνθρώπῳ, λέγοντι δράκοντα καὶ ἀλώπεκα καὶ λύκον καὶ ἀετὸν καὶ ἱέρακα τῆς τῶν ἀνθρώπων φύσεως εἶναι θεοφιλέστερα; 

How impious, indeed, is the assertion of this man, who charges us with impiety, that "not only are the irrational animals wiser than the human race, but that they are more beloved by God (than they)!" And who would not be repelled (by horror) from paying any attention to a man who declared that a serpent, and a fox, and a wolf, and an eagle, and a hawk, were more beloved by God than the human race? 

Ἀκολουθεῖ δ' αὐτῷ τὸ λέγειν ὅτι, εἴπερ θεοφιλέστερα τάδε τὰ ζῷα τῶν ἀνθρώπων, δῆλον ὅτι καὶ Σωκράτους καὶ Πλάτωνος καὶ Πυθαγόρου καὶ Φερεκύδου καὶ ὧν πρὸ βραχέος ὕμνησε θεολόγων θεοφιλέστερά ἐστι ταῦτα τὰ ζῷα. 

For it follows from his maintaining such a position, that if these animals be more beloved by God than human beings, it is manifest that they are dearer to God than Socrates, and Plato, and Pythagoras, and Pherecydes, and those theologians whose praises he had sung a little before. 

Καὶ ἐπεύξαιτό γ' ἄν τις αὐτῷ λέγων· εἴπερ θεοφιλέστερά ἐστι τάδε τὰ ζῷα τῶν ἀνθρώπων, γένοιο μετ' ἐκείνων θεοφιλὴς καὶ ἐξομοιωθείης τοῖς κατὰ σὲ ἀνθρώπων θεοφιλεστέροις. 

And one might address him with the prayer: "If these animals be dearer to God than men, may you be beloved of God along with them, and be made like to those whom you consider as dearer to Him than human beings!" 

Καὶ μὴ ὑπολαμβανέτω γε ἀρὰν εἶναι τὸ τοιοῦτον· τίς γὰρ οὐκ ἂν εὔξαιτο οἷς πείθεται εἶναι θεοφιλεστέροις γενέσθαι πάντῃ παραπλήσιος, ἵνα καὶ αὐτὸς ὡς ἐκεῖνοι γένηται θεοφιλής;

And let no one suppose that such a prayer is meant as an imprecation; for who would not pray to resemble in all respects those whom he believes to be dearer to God than others, in order that he, like them, may enjoy the divine love? 

Θέλων δὲ τὰς ὁμιλίας τῶν ἀλόγων ζῴων εἶναι τῶν ἡμετέρων ἱερωτέρας ὁ Κέλσος οὐ τοῖς τυχοῦσιν ἀνατίθησι τὴν ἱστορίαν ταύτην ἀλλὰ τοῖς συνετοῖς. 

And as Celsus is desirous to show that the assemblies of the irrational animals are more sacred than ours, he ascribes the statement to that effect not to any ordinary individuals, but to persons of intelligence. 

Συνετοὶ δὲ κατὰ ἀλήθειάν εἰσιν οἱ σπουδαῖοι, οὐδεὶς γὰρ φαῦλος συνετός. 

Yet it is the virtuous alone who are truly wise, for no wicked man is so. 

Λέγει τοίνυν τὸν τρόπον τοῦτον, ὅτι φασὶ δὲ τῶν ἀνθρώπων οἱ συνετοὶ καὶ ὁμιλίας ἐκείνοις εἶναι, δηλονότι τῶν ἡμετέρων ἱερωτέρας, καὶ αὐτοί που γνωρίζειν τὰ λεγόμενα καὶ ἔργῳ δεικνύειν ὅτι οὐκ ἀγνοοῦσιν, ὅταν προειπόντες ὅτι ἔφασαν οἱ ὄρνιθες ὡς ἀπίασί ποι καὶ ποιήσουσι τόδε ἢ τόδε δεικνύωσιν ἀπελθόντας ἐκεῖ καὶ ποιοῦντας ἃ ἤδη προεῖπον. 

He speaks, accordingly, in the following style: "Intelligent men say that these animals hold assemblies which are more sacred than ours, and that they know what is spoken at them, and actually prove that they are not without such knowledge, when they mention beforehand that the birds have announced their intention of departing to a particular place, or of doing this thing or that, and then show that they have departed to the place in question, and have done the particular thing which was foretold." 

Κατὰ μὲν οὖν τὸ ἀληθὲς οὐδεὶς συνετὸς τοιαῦτα ἱστόρησε, καὶ οὐδεὶς σοφὸς ἱερωτέρας εἶπεν εἶναι τὰς τῶν ἀλόγων ζῴων ὁμιλίας τῆς τῶν ἀνθρώπων. 

Now, truly, no person of intelligence ever related such things; nor did any wise man ever say that the assemblies of the irrational animals were more sacred than those of men.

Εἰ δ' ὑπὲρ τοῦ ἐξετάσαι τὰ Κέλσου τἀκόλουθον σκοποῦμεν, δῆλον ὅτι κατ' αὐτὸν ἱερώτεραι τῶν σεμνῶν Φερεκύδου καὶ Πυθαγόρου καὶ Σωκράτους καὶ Πλάτωνος καὶ τῶν φιλοσόφων ὁμιλιῶν εἰσιν αἱ τῶν ἀλόγων ζῴων· ὅπερ ἐστὶ καὶ αὐτόθεν οὐ μόνον ἀπεμφαῖνον ἀλλὰ καὶ ἀτοπώτατον. 

But if, for the purpose of examining (the soundness of) his statements, we look to their consequences, it is evident that, in his opinion, the assemblies of the irrational animals are more sacred than those of the venerable Pherecydes, and Pythagoras, and Socrates, and Plato, and of philosophers in general; which assertion is not only incongruous in itself, but full of absurdity. 

Ἵνα δὲ καὶ πιστεύσωμέν τινας, ἐκ τῆς ἀσήμου φωνῆς τῶν ὀρνίθων μαθόντας ὅτι ἀπίασί ποι οἱ ὄρνιθες καὶ ποιήσουσι τόδε ἢ τόδε, προδηλοῦν, καὶ τοῦτ' ἐροῦμεν ἀπὸ τῶν δαιμόνων συμβολικῶς ἀνθρώποις δεδηλῶσθαι κατὰ σκοπὸν τὸν περὶ τοῦ ἀπατηθῆναι ὑπὸ τῶν δαιμόνων τὸν ἄνθρωπον καὶ κατασπασθῆναι αὐτοῦ τὸν νοῦν ἀπ' οὐρανοῦ καὶ θεοῦ ἐπὶ γῆν καὶ τὰ ἔτι κατωτέρω.

In order that we may believe, however, that certain individuals do learn from the indistinct sound of birds that they are about to take their departure, and do this thing or that, and announce these things beforehand, we would say that this information is imparted to men by demons by means of signs, with the view of having men deceived by demons, and having their understanding dragged down from God and heaven to earth, and to places lower still.

Τοιοῦτόν τι δή μοι φαίνεται ὁ Κέλσος οἰκονομῶν ἐκτεθεῖσθαι, ὡς ἄρα Χριστιανοὶ λέγουσι κατηραμένον θεὸν τὸν δημιουργόν, ἵν' ὁ πιστεύων αὐτῷ ταῦτα καθ' ἡμῶν λέγοντι εἰ δυνατὸν καὶ ἐπὶ τὸ αἱρεῖν ὁρμήσαι Χριστιανοὺς ὡς πάντων ἀσεβεστάτους. 

With some such object as this in view does Celsus seem to have been actuated, when he alleged that Christians term the Creator an "accursed divinity;" in order that he who believes these charges of his against us, should, if possible, arise and exterminate the Christians as the most impious Of mankind. 

Φύρων δὲ τὰ πράγματα καὶ τὴν αἰτίαν ἐκτίθεται τοῦ κατηραμένον λέγεσθαι τὸν τῆς κατὰ Μωϋσέα κοσμοποιΐας θεὸν φάσκων ὅτι τοιοῦτός ἐστιν καὶ ἀρᾶς ἄξιος κατὰ τοὺς ταῦτα περὶ αὐτοῦ δοξάζοντας, ἐπείπερ τῷ ὄφει, γνῶσιν καλοῦ καὶ κακοῦ τοῖς πρώτοις ἀνθρώποις εἰσηγουμένῳ, κατηράσατο.

Confusing, moreover, things that are distinct, he states also the reason why the God of the Mosaic cosmogony is termed "accursed," asserting that "such is his character, and worthy of execration in the opinion of those who so regard him, inasmuch as he pronounced a curse upon the serpent, who introduced the first human beings to the knowledge of good and evil." 

Εἰδέναι δ' αὐτὸν ἐχρῆν ὅτι οἱ τὰ τοῦ ὄφεως ἑλόμενοι ὡς καλῶς τοῖς πρώτοις ἀνθρώποις συμβουλεύσαντος καὶ Τιτᾶνας καὶ Γίγαντας τοὺς μυθικοὺς ὑπερβαλόντες καὶ Ὀφιανοὶ διὰ τοῦτο καλούμενοι τοσοῦτον ἀποδέουσι τοῦ εἶναι Χριστιανοί, ὥστ' οὐκ ἔλαττον Κέλσου κατηγορεῖν αὐτοὺς τοῦ Ἰησοῦ καὶ μὴ πρότερον προσίεσθαί τινα ἐπὶ τὸ συνέδριον ἑαυτῶν, ἐὰν μὴ ἀρὰς θῆται κατὰ τοῦ Ἰησοῦ. 

Now he ought to have known that those who have espoused the cause of the serpent, because he gave good advice to the first human beings, and who go far beyond the Titans and Giants of fable, and are on this account called Ophites, are so far from being Christians, that they bring accusations against Jesus to as great a degree as Celsus himself; and they do not admit any one into their assembly until he has uttered maledictions against Jesus. 

Ὅρα γοῦν πῶς ἀλογώτατον πεποίηκεν ὁ Κέλσος ἐν τοῖς κατὰ Χριστιανῶν λόγοις παραλαβὼν ὡς Χριστιανοὺς τοὺς μηδ' ἀκούειν θέλοντας τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ Ἰησοῦ, κἂν ὅτι σοφός τις ἢ μέτριος τὰ ἤθη ἄνθρωπός τις ἦν. 

See, then, how irrational is the procedure of Celsus, who, in his discourse against the Christians, represents as such those who will not even listen to the name of Jesus, or omit even that He was a wise man, or a person of virtuous character! 

Τί οὖν εἴη ἂν ἠλιθιώτερον ἢ μανικώτερον οὐ μόνον τῶν ἀπὸ τοῦ ὄφεως ὡς ἀρχηγοῦ τῶν καλῶν χρηματίσαι βουληθέντων ἀλλὰ καὶ Κέλσου, νομίσαντος κατὰ Χριστιανῶν εἶναι κατηγορίας τὰς κατὰ τῶν Ὀφιανῶν; 

What, then, could evince greater folly or madness, not only on the part of those who wish to derive their name from the serpent as the author of good, but also on the part of Celsus, who thinks that the accusations with which the Ophites are charged, are chargeable also against the Christians! 

Πάλαι μὲν οὖν ὁ τὴν εὐτέλειαν ἀγαπήσας φιλόσοφος Ἑλλήνων καὶ παράδειγμα ἐκθεὶς εὐδαίμονος βίου, ὡς οὐ κωλυόμενος εὐδαιμονεῖν ἀπὸ τῆς παντελοῦς ἀκτημοσύνης, Κυνικὸν ἑαυτὸν ἀνηγόρευσεν· οὗτοι δὲ οἱ ἀνόσιοι ἀπὸ τοῦ πολεμιωτάτου ἀνθρώποις ὄφεως καὶ φρικτοτάτου ὡς οὐκ ἄνθρωποι, ὧν ἐχθρός ἐστιν ὄφις, ἀλλ' ὡς ὄφεις σεμνύνονται ἐπὶ τῷ Ὀφιανοὶ καλεῖσθαι, Εὐφράτην τινὰ εἰσηγητὴν τῶν ἀνοσίων αὐχοῦντες λόγων.

Long ago, indeed, that Greek philosopher who preferred a state of poverty, and who exhibited the pattern of a happy life, showing that he was not excluded from happiness although he was possessed of nothing, termed himself a Cynic; while these impious wretches, as not being human beings, whose enemy the serpent is, but as being serpents, pride themselves upon being called Ophites from the serpent, which is an animal most hostile to and greatly dreaded by man, and boast of one Euphrates as the introducer of these unhallowed opinions.

### c29

Εἶθ' ἑξῆς ὡς Χριστιανοῖς λοιδορούμενος καὶ κατηγορῶν τῶν κατηραμένον εἰπόντων τὸν Μωϋσέως καὶ τοῦ κατ' αὐτὸν νόμου θεὸν καὶ οἰόμενος Χριστιανοὺς εἶναι τοὺς ταῦτα λέγοντάς φησι· Τί ἂν ἠλιθιώτερον ἢ μανικώτερον ταύτης τῆς ἀναισθήτου σοφίας γένοιτο; 

In the next place, as if it were the Christians whom he was calumniating, he continues his accusations against those who termed the God of Moses and of his law an "accursed" divinity; and imagining that it is the Christians who so speak, he expresses himself thus: "What could be more foolish or insane than such senseless wisdom? 

Τί γὰρ ἐσφάλη ὁ Ἰουδαίων νομοθέτης; Καὶ πῶς τὴν ἐκείνου κοσμογένειαν σαυτῷ διά τινος, ὡς φῄς, τυπώδους ἀλληγορίας λαμβάνεις ἢ τὸν Ἰουδαίων νόμον, ἐπαινεῖς δὲ ἄκων, ὦ δυσσεβέστατε, τὸν τοῦ κόσμου δημιουργόν, τὸν πάντα ὑποσχόμενον αὐτοῖς, τὸν τὸ γένος αὐτῶν αὐξήσειν μέχρι περάτων γῆς ἐπαγγειλάμενον καὶ ἀναστήσειν ἐκ νεκρῶν αὐτῇ σαρκὶ καὶ αἵματι καὶ τοῖς προφήταις ἐμπνέοντα, καὶ πάλιν τοῦτον λοιδορεῖς; 

For what blunder has the Jewish lawgiver committed? and why do you accept, by means, as you say, of a certain allegorical and typical method of interpretation, the cosmogony which he gives, and the law of the Jews, while it is with unwillingness, O most impious man, that you give praise to the Creator of the world, who promised to give them all things; who promised to multiply their race to the ends of the earth, and to raise them up from the dead with the same flesh and blood, and who gave inspiration to their prophets; and, again, you slander Him! 

Ἀλλ' ὅταν μὲν ὑπὸ τούτων βιάζῃ, τὸν αὐτὸν θεὸν σέβειν ὁμολογεῖς· ὅταν δὲ τὰ ἐναντία ὁ σὸς διδάσκαλος Ἰησοῦς καὶ ὁ Ἰουδαίων Μωϋσῆς νομοθετῇ, θεὸν ἄλλον ἀντὶ τούτου καὶ τοῦ πατρὸς ζητεῖς.

When you feel the force of such considerations, indeed, you acknowledge that you worship the same God; but when your teacher Jesus and the Jewish Moses give contradictory decisions, you seek another God, instead of Him, and the Father!" 

Καὶ ἐν τούτοις δὴ ὁ γενναιότατος φιλόσοφος Κέλσος σαφῶς Χριστιανοὺς συκοφαντεῖ, λέγων τοὺς αὐτούς, ἡνίκα μὲν ἂν Ἰουδαῖοι αὐτοὺς βιάζωνται, τὸν αὐτὸν αὐτοῖς θεὸν ὁμολογεῖν· ὅταν δὲ τὰ ἐναντία Ἰησοῦς Μωϋσεῖ νομοθετῇ, ἄλλον ἀντὶ τούτου ζητεῖν. 

Now, by such statements, this illustrious philosopher Celsus distinctly slanders the Christians, asserting that, when the Jews press them hard, they acknowledge the same God as they do; but that when Jesus legislates differently from Moses, they seek another god instead of Him. 

Εἴτε γὰρ Ἰουδαίοις διαλεγόμενοι εἴτε καθ' ἑαυτοὺς ὄντες ἕνα καὶ τὸν αὐτὸν ἴσμεν, ὃν καὶ πάλαι ἔσεβον Ἰουδαῖοι καὶ νῦν σέβειν ἐπαγγέλλονται θεόν, οὐδαμῶς εἰς αὐτὸν ἀσεβοῦντες. Ἀλλ' οὐδ' ἀναστήσειν ἐκ νεκρῶν αὐτῇ σαρκὶ καὶ αἵματί φαμεν τὸν θεόν, ὡς ἐν τοῖς ἀνωτέρω λέλεκται· οὐ γὰρ τὸ σπειρόμενον «ἐν φθορᾷ» καὶ «ἐν ἀτιμίᾳ» καὶ «ἐν ἀσθενείᾳ» «σῶμα ψυχικόν» φαμεν ἀνίστασθαι, ὁποῖον ἐσπάρη. Ἀλλὰ γὰρ περὶ τούτων ἐν τοῖς ἀνωτέρω μετρίως ἡμῖν λέλεκται.

Now, whether we are conversing with the Jews, or are alone with ourselves, we know of only one and the same God, whom the Jews also worshipped of old time, and still profess to worship as God, and we are guilty of no impiety towards Him. We do not assert, however; that God will raise men from the dead with the same flesh and blood, as has been shown in the preceding pages; for we do not maintain that the natural body, which is sown in corruption, and in dishonour, and in weakness, will rise again such as it was sown. On such subjects, however, we have spoken at adequate length in the foregoing pages.

### c30

Εἶθ' ἑξῆς ἐπαναλαμβάνει τὰ περὶ τῶν ἑπτὰ ἀρχόντων δαιμόνων, μηδαμῶς μὲν ὑπὸ Χριστιανῶν ὀνομαζομένων οἶμαι δ' ὑπὸ Ὀφιανῶν παραλαμβανομένων. 

He next returns to the subject of the Seven ruling Demons, whose names are not found among Christians, but who, I think, are accepted by the Ophites. 

Καὶ εὕρομέν γε ἐν ᾧ καὶ ἡμεῖς δι' ἐκείνους ἐκτησάμεθα διαγράμματι τὴν τάξιν ὁμοίως ἐκκειμένην οἷς ὁ Κέλσος ἐξέθετο. 

We found, indeed, that in the diagram, which on their account we procured a sight of, the same order was laid down as that which Celsus has given. 

Ὁ μὲν οὖν Κέλσος ἔλεγε τὸν πρῶτον ἰδέᾳ λέοντος μεμορφωμένον, οὐκ ἐκθέμενος, τίνα αὐτὸν ὀνομάζουσιν οἱ ἀληθῶς δυσσεβέστατοι· ἡμεῖς δὲ εὕρομεν ὅτι τὸν ἐν ταῖς ἱεραῖς γραφαῖς εὐφημούμενον ἄγγελον τοῦ δημιουργοῦ, τοῦτον τὸ μιαρὸν ἐκεῖνο διάγραμμα ἔλεγεν εἶναι Μιχαὴλ τὸν λεοντοειδῆ. 

Celsus says that "the goat was shaped like a lion," not mentioning the name given him by those who are truly the most impious of individuals; whereas we discovered that He who is honoured in holy Scripture as the angel of the Creator is called by this accursed diagram Michael the Lion-like. 

Πάλιν τ' αὖ ὁ μὲν Κέλσος ἔφασκε τὸν ἑξῆς καὶ δεύτερον εἶναι ταῦρον· ὃ δ' εἴχομεν διάγραμμα τὸν Σουριὴλ ἔλεγεν εἶναι τὸν ταυροειδῆ. 

Again, Celsus says that the "second in order is a bull;" whereas the diagram which we possessed made him to be Suriel, the bull-like. 

Εἶτα ὁ μὲν Κέλσος τρίτον ἀμφίβιόν τινα καὶ φρικῶδες ἐπισυρίζοντα· τὸ δὲ διάγραμμα τρίτον Ῥαφαὴλ ἔλεγεν εἶναι δρακοντοειδῆ. 

Further, Celsus termed the third "an amphibious sort of animal, and one that hissed frightfully;" while the diagram described the third as Raphael, the serpent-like. 

Πάλιν τε αὖ ὁ μὲν Κέλσος τὸν τέταρτον ἀετοῦ ἔφασκεν ἔχειν μορφήν· τὸ δὲ διάγραμμα Γαβριὴλ ἔλεγεν εἶναι τὸν ἀετοειδῆ. 

Moreover, Celsus asserted that the "fourth had the form of an eagle;" the diagram representing him as Gabriel, the eagle-like. 

Εἶθ' ὁ μὲν Κέλσος τὸν πέμπτον ἔφασκεν εἶναι ἄρκου πρόσωπον ἔχοντα· τὸ δὲ διάγραμμα τὸν Θαυθαβαὼθ ἔφασκεν εἶναι τὸν ἀρκοειδῆ. 

Again, the "fifth," according to Celsus, "had the countenance of a bear;" and this, according to the diagram, was Thauthabaoth, the bear-like. 

Εἶθ' ὁ μὲν Κέλσος τὸν ἕκτον κυνὸς πρόσωπον ἔλεγεν ἱστορεῖσθαι ἔχειν παρ' ἐκείνοις· τὸ δὲ διάγραμμα ἔφασκεν εἶναι αὐτὸν Ἐραθαώθ. 

Celsus continues his account, that the "sixth was described as having the face of a dog;" and him the diagram called Erataoth. 

Εἶθ' ὁ μὲν Κέλσος τὸν ἕβδομον ἔφασκεν ὄνου ἔχειν πρόσωπον, καὶ ὀνομάζεσθαι αὐτὸν Θαφαβαὼθ ἢ Ὀνοήλ· ἡμεῖς δ' ἐν τῷ διαγράμματι εὕρομεν ὅτι οὗτος καλεῖται Ὀνοὴλ ἢ Θαρθαραώθ, ὀνοειδής τις τυγχάνων. 

The "seventh," he adds, "had the countenance of an ass, and was named Thaphabaoth or Onoel;" whereas we discovered that in the diagram he is called Onoel, or Thartharaoth, being somewhat asinine in appearance. 

Ἔδοξε δὲ καὶ ἡμῖν ἀκριβῶς ἐκθέσθαι τὰ τοιαῦτα, ἵνα μὴ δοκῶμεν ἀγνοεῖν ἃ Κέλσος ἐπηγγέλλετο εἰδέναι· ἀλλὰ καὶ παραστήσωμεν ἀκριβέστερον ἐκείνου αὐτὰ ἐγνωκότες οἱ Χριστιανοί, ὡς οὐ Χριστιανῶν λόγους ἀλλὰ πάντῃ ἀλλοτρίων σωτηρίας καὶ οὐδαμῶς ἐπιγραφομένων Ἰησοῦν ἢ σωτῆρα ἢ θεὸν ἢ διδάσκαλον ἢ υἱὸν θεοῦ.

We have thought it proper to be exact in stating these matters, that we might not appear to be ignorant of those things which Celsus professed to know, but that we Christians, knowing them better than he, may demonstrate that these are not the words of Christians, but of those who are altogether alienated from salvation, and who neither acknowledge Jesus as Saviour, nor God, nor Teacher, nor Son of God.

### c42

Ἑξῆς δὲ τούτοις ἀπὸ ἄλλης ἀρχῆς ὁ Κέλσος τοιαῦτά φησι καθ' ἡμῶν· Σφάλλονται δὲ ἀσεβέστατα ἄττα καὶ περὶ τήνδε τὴν μεγίστην ἄγνοιαν, ὁμοίως ἀπὸ θείων αἰνιγμάτων πεπλανημένην, ποιοῦντες τῷ θεῷ ἐναντίον τινά, διάβολόν τε καὶ γλώττῃ ἑβραίᾳ Σατανᾶν ὀνομάζοντες τὸν αὐτόν. 

After these matters, Celsus brings the following charges against us from another quarter: "Certain most impious errors," he says, "are committed by them, due to their extreme ignorance, in which they have wandered away from the meaning of the divine enigmas, creating an adversary to God, the devil, and naming him in the Hebrew tongue, Satan. 

Ἄλλως μὲν οὖν παντελῶς θνητὰ ταῦτα καὶ οὐδ' ὅσια λέγειν, ὅτι δὴ ὁ μέγιστος θεός, βουλόμενός τι ἀνθρώπους ὠφελῆσαι, τὸν ἀντιπράσσοντα ἔχει καὶ ἀδυνατεῖ. 

Now, of a truth, such statements are altogether of mortal invention, and not even proper to be repeated, viz., that the mighty God, in His desire to confer good upon men, has yet one counterworking Him, and is helpless. 

Ὁ τοῦ θεοῦ παῖς ἄρα ἡττᾶται ὑπὸ τοῦ διαβόλου, καὶ κολαζόμενος ὑπ' αὐτοῦ διδάσκει καὶ ἡμᾶς τῶν ὑπὸ τούτῳ κολάσεων καταφρονεῖν, προαγορεύων ὡς ἄρα ὁ Σατανᾶς καὶ αὐτὸς ὁμοίως φανεὶς ἐπιδείξεται μεγάλα ἔργα καὶ θαυμαστά, σφετεριζόμενος τὴν τοῦ θεοῦ δόξαν· οἷς οὐ χρῆναι βουκοληθέντας ἀποτρέπεσθαι πρὸς ἐκεῖνον, ἀλλὰ μόνῳ πιστεύειν ἑαυτῷ. 

The Son of God, it follows, is vanquished by the devil; and being punished by him, teaches us also to despise the punishments which he inflicts, telling us beforehand that Satan, after appearing to men as He Himself had done, will exhibit great and marvellous works, claiming for himself the glory of God, but that those who wish to keep him at a distance ought to pay no attention to these works of Satan, but to place their faith in Him alone. 

Ταῦτα μέν γε ἐστὶν ἄντικρυς ἀνθρώπου γόητος, ἐργολαβοῦντος καὶ προφυλαττομένου τοὺς ἀντιδοξοῦντάς τε καὶ ἀνταγείροντας.

Such statements are manifestly the words of a deluder, planning and manoeuvring against those who are opposed to his views, and who rank themselves against them." 

Εἶθ' ἑξῆς τούτοις <ἐκτίθεσθαι> βουλόμενος τὰ αἰνίγματα, ὧν οἴεται παρακηκοότας ἡμᾶς τὰ περὶ τοῦ Σατανᾶ εἰσάγειν, φησὶ θεῖόν τινα πόλεμον αἰνίττεσθαι τοὺς παλαιούς, Ἡράκλειτον μὲν λέγοντα ὧδε· «Εἰδέναι δὲ χρὴ τὸν πόλεμον ἐόντα ξυνὸν καὶ δίκην ἔριν, καὶ γινόμενα πάντα κατ' ἔριν καὶ χρεών»· 

In the next place, desiring to point out the "enigmas," our mistakes regarding which lead to the introduction of our views concerning Satan, he continues: "The ancients allude obscurely to a certain war among the gods, Heraclitus speaking thus of it: 'If one must say that there is a general war and discord, and that all things are done and administered in strife.' 

Φερεκύδην δὲ πολλῷ ἀρχαιότερον γενόμενον Ἡρακλείτου μυθοποιΐαν, στρατείαν στρατείᾳ παραταττομένην, καὶ τῆς μὲν ἡγεμόνα Κρόνον διδόναι τῆς ἑτέρας δὲ Ὀφιονέα, προκλήσεις τε καὶ ἁμίλλας αὐτῶν ἱστορεῖν, συνθήκας τε αὐτοῖς γίνεσθαι, ἵν' ὁπότεροι αὐτῶν εἰς τὸν Ὠγηνὸν ἐμπέσωσι, τούτους μὲν εἶναι νενικημένους, τοὺς δ' ἐξώσαντας καὶ νικήσαντας τούτους ἔχειν τὸν οὐρανόν. 

Pherecydes, again, who is much older than Heraclitus, relates a myth of one army drown up in hostile array against another, and names Kronos as the leader of the one, and Ophioneus of the other, and recounts their challenges and struggles, and mentions that agreements were entered into between them, to the end that whichever party should fall into the Ocean should be held as vanquished, while those who had expelled and conquered them should have possession of heaven. 

Τούτου δὲ τοῦ βουλήματός φησιν ἔχεσθαι καὶ τὰ περὶ τοὺς Τιτᾶνας καὶ Γίγαντας μυστήρια, θεομαχεῖν ἀπαγγελλομένους, καὶ τὰ παρ' Αἰγυπτίοις περὶ Τυφῶνος καὶ Ὥρου καὶ Ὀσίριδος.

The mysteries relating to the Titans and Giants also had some such (symbolical) meaning, as well as the Egyptian mysteries of Typhon, and Horus, and Osiris." 

Εἶτ' ἐκθέμενος τὰ τοιαῦτα καὶ μὴ παραμυθησάμενος, τίνα τρόπον ἐκεῖνα μὲν λόγου ἔχεται κρείττονος ταῦτα δέ ἐστιν ἐκείνων παρακούσματα, διαλοιδορεῖται ἡμῖν λέγων μὴ εἶναι ἐκεῖνα ὅμοια τοῖς περὶ διαβόλου δαίμονος ἤ – ὅπερ φασὶν ἀληθέστερον – ἀνθρώπου γόητος ἀντιδοξοῦντος. 

After having made such statements, and not having got over the difficulty as to the way in which these accounts contain a higher view of things, while our accounts are erroneous copies of them, he continues his abuse of us, remarking that "these are not like the stories which are related of a devil, or demon, or, as he remarks with more truth, of a man who is an impostor, who wishes to establish an opposite doctrine." 

Οὕτω δ' ἀκούει καὶ Ὁμήρου, ὡς τὰ παραπλήσια τῷ Ἡρακλείτῳ καὶ Φερεκύδῃ καὶ τοῖς τὰ περὶ Τιτᾶνας καὶ Γίγαντας μυστήρια εἰσάγουσιν αἰνισσομένου ἐν τούτοις <τοῖς> τοῦ Ἡφαίστου πρὸς τὴν Ἥραν λόγοις, φάσκοντος·

And in the same way he understands Homer, as if he referred obscurely to matters similar to those mentioned by Heraclitus, and Pherecydes, and the originators of the mysteries about the Titans and Giants, in those words which Hephaestus addresses to Hera as follows:- 

       Ἤδη γάρ <με> καὶ ἄλλοτ' ἀλεξέμεναι μεμαῶτα

       ῥῖψε ποδὸς τεταγὼν ἀπὸ βηλοῦ θεσπεσίοιο,

"Once in your cause I felt his matchless might, Hurled headlong downward from the ethereal height."

καὶ τοῖς τοῦ Διὸς πρὸς τὴν Ἥραν οὕτως·

And in those of Zeus to Hera:- 

       Ἦ οὐ μέμνησ' ὅτε τ' ἐκρέμω ὑψόθεν, ἐκ δὲ ποδοῖιν

       ἄκμονας ἧκα δύω, περὶ χερσὶ δὲ δεσμὸν ἴηλα

       χρύσεον ἄῤῥηκτον; Σὺ δ' ἐν αἰθέρι καὶ νεφέλῃσιν

       ἐκρέμω· ἠλάστεον δὲ θεοὶ κατὰ μακρὸν Ὄλυμπον,

       λῦσαι δ' οὐκ ἐδύναντο παρασταδόν· ὃν δὲ λάβοιμι,

       ῥίπτασκον τεταγὼν ἀπὸ βηλοῦ, ὄφρ' ἂν ἵκοιτο

       γῆν ὀλιγηπελέων·

"Hast thou forgot, when, bound and fix'd on high, From the vast concave of the spangled sky, I hung thee trembling in a golden chain, And all the raging gods opposed in vain? Headlong I hurled them from the Olympian hall, Stunn'd in the whirl, and breathless with the fall."

καὶ διηγούμενός γε τὰ ὁμηρικὰ ἔπη φησὶ λόγους εἶναι τοῦ θεοῦ πρὸς τὴν ὕλην τοὺς λόγους τοῦ Διὸς πρὸς τὴν Ἥραν, τοὺς δὲ πρὸς τὴν ὕλην λόγους αἰνίττεσθαι ὡς ἄρα ἐξ ἀρχῆς αὐτὴν πλημμελῶς ἔχουσαν διαλαβὼν ἀναλογίαις τισὶ συνέδησε καὶ ἐκόσμησεν ὁ θεός, καὶ ὅτι τοὺς περὶ αὐτὴν δαίμονας, ὅσοι ὑβρισταί, τούτους ἀποῤῥιπτεῖ κολάζων αὐτοὺς τῇ δεῦρο ὁδῷ. 

Interpreting, moreover, the words of Homer, he adds: "The words of Zeus addressed to Hera are the words of God addressed to matter; and the words addressed to matter obscurely signify that the matter which at the beginning was in a state of discord (with God), was taken by Him, and bound together and arranged under laws, which may be analogically compared to chains; and that by way of chastising the demons who create disorder in it, he hurls them down headlong to this lower world." 

Ταῦτα δὲ τὰ Ὁμήρου ἔπη οὕτω νοήσαντα τὸν Φερεκύδην φησὶν εἰρηκέναι τό· «Κείνης δὲ τῆς μοίρας ἔνερθέν ἐστιν ἡ ταρταρίη μοῖρα· φυλάσσουσι δ' αὐτὴν θυγατέρες Βορέου Ἅρπυιαί τε καὶ Θύελλα, ἔνθα Ζεὺς ἐκβάλλει θεῶν ὅταν τις ἐξυβρίσῃ.» Τῶν τοιούτων δέ φησιν ἔχεσθαι νοημάτων καὶ τὸν περικαλλῆ τῆς Ἀθηνᾶς πέπλον ἐν τῇ πομπῇ τῶν Παναθηναίων ὑπὸ πάντων θεωρούμενον. Δηλοῦται γάρ, φησίν, ἀπ' αὐτοῦ ὅτι ἀμήτωρ τις καὶ ἄχραντος δαίμων ἐπικρατεῖ θρασυνομένων τῶν γηγενῶν.

These words of Homer, he alleges, were so understood by Pherecydes, when he said that beneath that region is the region of Tartarus, which is guarded by the Harpies and Tempest, daughters of Boreas, and to which Zeus banishes any one of the gods who becomes disorderly. With the same ideas also are closely connected the peplos of Athena, which is beheld by all in the procession of the Panathenoea. For it is manifest from this, he continues, that a motherless and unsullied demon has the mastery over the daring of the Giants. 

Ἀποδεξάμενος δὲ τὰ Ἑλλήνων πλάσματα ἐπιλέγει κατηγορῶν τῶν ἡμετέρων τοιαῦτα, ὅτι <τὸ> θεοῦ υἱὸν ὑπὸ διαβόλου κολάζεσθαι καὶ ἡμᾶς διδάσκει, ὡς ἂν ὑπὸ τοῦ αὐτοῦ κολαζόμενοι καρτεροῖμεν. 

While accepting, moreover, the fictions of the Greeks, he continues to heap against us such accusations as the following, viz., that "the Son of God is punished by the devil, and teaches us that we also, when punished by him, ought to endure it. 

Καὶ ταῦτά γ' ἀπάντῃ καταγέλαστα· ἐχρῆν γὰρ οἶμαι κολάσαι τὸν διάβολον ἀλλ' οὐ τοῖς ὑπ' αὐτοῦ διαβεβλημένοις ἀνθρώποις ἀπειλεῖν.

Now these statements are altogether ridiculous. For it is the devil, I think, who ought rather to be punished, and those human beings who are calumniated by him ought not to be threatened with chastisement."

### c43

Ὅρα οὖν εἰ μὴ ὁ ἐγκαλῶν ἡμῖν <ὡς> σφαλλομένοις ἀσεβέστατα καὶ ἀποπεπλανημένοις θείων αἰνιγμάτων αὐτὸς σαφῶς σφάλλεται, μὴ κατανοήσας ὅτι τὰ πολλῷ οὐ μόνον Ἡρακλείτου καὶ Φερεκύδου ἀρχαιότερα ἀλλὰ καὶ Ὁμήρου Μωϋσέως γράμματα εἰσήγαγε τὸν περὶ τοῦ πονηροῦ τούτου καὶ ἐκπεσόντος τῶν οὐρανίων λόγον. 
 
Mark now, whether he who charges us with having committed errors of the most impious kind, and with having wandered away from the (true meaning) of the divine enigmas, is not himself clearly in error, from not observing that in the writings of Moses, which are much older not merely than Heraclitus and Pherecydes, but even than Homer, mention is made of this wicked one, and of his having fallen from heaven. 

Ὁ γὰρ «ὄφις», παρ' ὃν ὁ παρὰ τῷ Φερεκύδῃ γέγονεν Ὀφιονεύς, αἴτιος γενόμενος τοῦ ἐκβληθῆναι τοῦ θείου παραδείσου τὸν ἄνθρωπον, τοιαῦτά τινα αἰνίσσεται, ἐπαγγελίᾳ θεότητος καὶ μειζόνων ἀπατήσας τὸ θηλύτερον γένος· ᾧ συνηκολουθηκέναι λέγεται καὶ ὁ ἀνήρ. 
 
For the serpent--from whom the Ophioneus spoken of by Pherecydes is derived--having become the cause of man's expulsion from the divine Paradise, obscurely shadows forth something similar, having deceived the woman by a promise of divinity and of greater blessings; and her example is said to have been followed also by the man. 

 Καὶ ὁ ἐν τῇ Μωϋσέως δὲ Ἐξόδῳ ὀλεθρευτὴς τίς ἄλλος εἴη ἢ ὁ τοῦ ὀλέθρου τοῖς πειθομένοις αὐτῷ καὶ μὴ ἀνθισταμένοις αὐτοῦ τῇ κακίᾳ καὶ μὴ ἀνταγωνιζομένοις αἴτιος; Ἔτι δὲ ὁ ἐν τῷ Λευϊτικῷ ἀποπομπαῖος, ὃν ἡ ἑβραϊκὴ γραφὴ ὠνόμασεν Ἀζαζήλ, οὐδεὶς ἕτερος ἦν· <ὃν> ἀποπέμπεσθαι καὶ ἀποτροπιάζεσθαι ἔδει τὸν κλῆρον ἔχοντα ἐν ἐρήμῳ· 
 
And, further, who else could the destroying angel mentioned in the Exodus of Moses be, than he who was the author of destruction to them that obeyed him, and did not withstand his wicked deeds, nor struggle against them? Moreover (the goat), which in the book Of Leviticus is sent away (into the wilderness), and which in the Hebrew language is named Azazel, was none other than this; and it was necessary to send it away into the desert, and to treat it as an expiatory sacrifice, because on it the lot fell. 

πάντες γὰρ οἱ τῆς τοῦ χείρονος διὰ τὴν κακίαν μερίδος ἐναντίοι ὄντες τοῖς ἀπὸ τοῦ κλήρου τοῦ θεοῦ ἔρημοί εἰσι θεοῦ. 
 
For all who belong to the "worse" part, on account of their wickedness, being opposed to those who are God's heritage, are deserted by God. 

Ἀλλὰ καὶ οἱ ἐν τοῖς Κριταῖς υἱοὶ Βελίαρ τίνος ἄλλου ἢ τούτου λέγονται εἶναι υἱοὶ διὰ τὴν πονηρίαν; 

Nay, with respect to the sons of Belial in the book of Judges, whose sons are they said to be, save his, on account of their wickedness? 

Σαφῶς δὲ παρὰ ταῦτα πάντα ἐν τῷ ἀρχαιοτέρῳ καὶ Μωϋσέως αὐτοῦ Ἰὼβ «ὁ διάβολος» ἀναγέγραπται παρίστασθαι τῷ θεῷ καὶ αἰτεῖν τὴν κατὰ τοῦ Ἰὼβ ἐξουσίαν, ἵν' αὐτὸν περιβάλῃ περιστάσεσι βαρυτάταις, πρώτῃ μὲν τῇ κατὰ πάντων τῶν ὑπαρχόντων αὐτῷ καὶ τῶν τέκνων αὐτοῦ ἀπωλείᾳ, δευτέρᾳ δὲ κατὰ τὸ περιβαλεῖν αὐτὸν ἀγρίῳ ἐλέφαντι, τῷ οὕτω καλουμένῳ νοσήματι, πᾶν τὸ σῶμα τοῦ Ἰώβ. 

And besides all these instances, in the book of Job, which is older even than Moses himself, the devil is distinctly described as presenting himself before God, and asking for power against Job, that he might involve him in trials of the most painful kind; the first of which consisted in the loss of all his goods and of his children, and the second in afflicting the whole body of Job with the so-called disease of elephantiasis. 

Ἐῶ γὰρ τὰ ἀπὸ τῶν εὐαγγελίων περὶ τοῦ πειράζοντος τὸν σωτῆρα διαβόλου, ἵνα μὴ δόξω ἀπὸ νεωτέρων γραφῶν φέρειν τὰ περὶ τοῦ ζητουμένου πρὸς τὸν Κέλσον. 

I pass by what might be quoted from the Gospels regarding the devil who tempted the Saviour, that I may not appear to quote in reply to Celsus from more recent writings on this question. 

Καὶ ἐν τοῖς τελευταίοις δὲ τοῦ Ἰώβ, ἐν οἷς ὁ κύριος διὰ λαίλαπος καὶ νεφελῶν εἶπε τῷ Ἰὼβ τὰ ἀναγεγραμμένα ἐν τῇ ὁμωνύμῳ βίβλῳ αὐτοῦ, οὐκ ὀλίγα ἐστὶ περὶ δράκοντος εἰρημένα λαβεῖν. 

In the last (chapter) also of Job, in which the Lord utters to Job amid tempest and clouds what is recorded in the book which bears his name there are not a few things referring to the serpent. 

Οὔπω λέγω καὶ τὰ ἀπὸ τοῦ Ἰεζεκιὴλ ὡς περὶ «Φαραὼ» ἢ «Ναβουχοδονόσορ» ἢ ἄρχοντος «Τύρου», ἢ τὰ ἀπὸ τοῦ Ἡσαΐου, ἐν οἷς θρηνεῖται ὁ βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος· ἀφ' ὧν οὐκ ὀλίγα τις ἂν μανθάνοι περὶ τῆς κακίας, ποίαν ἔσχεν ἀρχὴν καὶ γένεσιν, καὶ ὅτι ἀπό τινων πτεροῤῥυησάντων καὶ κατακολουθησάντων τῷ πρώτῳ πτεροῤῥυήσαντι ὑπέστη ἡ κακία.

I have not yet mentioned the passages in Ezekiel, where he speaks, as it were, of Pharaoh, or Nebuchadnezzar, or the prince of Tyre; or those in Isaiah, where lament is made for the king of Babylon, from which not a little might be learned concerning evil, as to the nature of its origin and generation, and as to how it derived its existence from some who had lost their wings, and who had followed him who was the first to lose his own.
