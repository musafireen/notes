तपसा चीयते ब्रह्म ततोऽन्नमभिजायते ।  
अन्नात्प्राणो मनः सत्यं लोकाः कर्मसु चामृतम् ॥ ८ ॥

By tapas Brahman increases in size and from it food is produced; from food the _prana,_ the mind, the Bhutas the worlds, karma and with it, its fruits.

अग्नीर्मूर्धा चक्षुषी चन्द्रसूर्यौ दिशः श्रोत्रे वाग्विवृताश्च वेदाः ।
वायुः प्रणो हृदयं विश्वमस्य पद्भ्यां पृथिवी ह्येष सर्वभूतान्तरात्मा ॥ ४ ॥

This is he, the internal atman of all created things whose head is agni, whose eyes are the sun, and the moon, whose ears are the four directions, whose speeches are the emanated Vedas, whose breath is vayu, whose heart is all the universe and from whose feet the earth proceeded.
## 3.1
#### 1
द्वा सुपर्णा सयुजा सखाया समानं वृक्षं परिषस्वजाते ।
तयोरन्यः पिप्पलं स्वाद्वत्त्यनश्नन्नन्यो अभिचाकशीति ॥ १ ॥

Two inseparable companions of fine plumage perch on the self-same tree. One of the two feeds on the delicious fruit. The other not tasting of it looks on.
#### 2
समाने वृक्षे पुरुषो निमग्नोऽनिशया शोचति मुह्यमानः ।
जुष्टं यदा पश्यत्यन्यमीशमस्य महिमानमिति वीतशोकः ॥ २ ॥

On the self same tree, the Jiva drowned as it were and perplexed, grieves owing to helplessness. But when he sees the other, the lord who is worshipped by all, and his glory, he becomes absolved from grief.

#### 3
यदा पश्यः पश्यते रुक्मवर्णं कर्तारमीशं पुरुषं ब्रह्मयोनिम् ।
तदा विद्वान्पुण्यपापे विधूय निरञ्जनः परमं साम्यमुपैति ॥ ३ ॥

When the seer sees him of golden line, the creator, lord, Purusha, and the source of (Apara) Brahma, then the knower, having shaken off all deeds of merit and sin, attains supreme equality, being untouched with stain.
#### 4
प्रणो ह्येष यः सर्वभूतैर्विभाति विजानन्विद्वान्भवते नातिवादी ।
आत्मक्रीड आत्मरतिः क्रियावानेष ब्रह्मविदां वरिष्ठः ॥

This is, indeed. Prana, i.e., Isvara, shining variously with all living beings. Knowing him, the wise man becomes not a talker regarding anything else. Sporting in self, delighted in self and doing nets (enjoined), this man is the best of those who know the Brahman.
#### 5
सत्येन लभ्यस्तपसा ह्येष आत्मा सम्यग्ज्ञानेन ब्रह्मचर्येण नित्यम् ।
अन्तःशरीरे ज्योतिर्मयो हि शुभ्रो यं पश्यन्ति यतयः क्षीणदोषाः ॥ ५ ॥

This Atman within the body, resplendent and pure, can be reached by truth and tapas, by sound knowledge and by abstinence from sexual pleasures constantly practised; he is within the body, resplendent and pure; him, assiduous Sanyasins see, their faults removed.
