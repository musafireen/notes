SUMMARY: Fragment 56 is the conclusion of the exposition by Apion (the Hellenized Egyptian grammarian?) begun in Fragment 55, found in the work known as Homilies by pseudo-Clement of Rome in which Apion discusses the primordial state of the universe as described by Orpheus. Also, for comparison, is a passage on the same subject from a Latin translation of Recognitiones (pseudo-Clement) by Tyrannius Rufinus.
##### Introduction

Orphic fragment 56 consists of two somewhat lengthy narratives, both of which have been attributed to Klímîs Róhmîs (Clêmês Rômês, Κλήμης Ῥώμης), Clement of Rome. The two passages are no longer thought to have been written by Clement. It is not known who actually wrote these texts, therefore, their authorship is described as "pseudo-Clement." Clement was the first bishop of Rome after Peter the Apostle, although this too is disputed. He is a character in both narratives, both of which contain ideas from a theogony thought of as Orphic.

The first quotation comes from a Greek text entitled Omilía (Homilia or Homilies, Ὁμιλίᾳ). It presents ideas purported to be the view of Apíôn (Ἀπίων), most likely the grammarian from Alexandria (25 BCE – 46 CE approx.) contemporary with Clement. (See Orphic fragment 55 for the beginning of Apíôn's exposition.)

The second quotation comes from a Latin text entitled Recognitiones. When doing research, it may appear that this book was written by Rufinus Aquileiensis (344/345–411 CE), but he was simply the translator. The original Greek text has been lost. This narrative is presented as Clement speaking at the behest of Peter the Apostle, with the aim of mocking the ideas of the Greeks.

The present author was able to find the Greek text for Ὁμιλίᾳ fairly easily online, but the Latin text for Recognitiones cannot be found (except as photographed pages of books). The passage had to be typed out manually from Otto Kern's Orphicorum fragmenta of 1922. With the publication of this page, it is now available to whoever needs it.

Kronos and Rhea Explained. 

Κρόνον οὖν τὸν χρόνον μοι νόει, τὴν δὲ Ῥέαν τὸ ῥέον τῆς ὑγρᾶς οὐσίας, 

"Now you must think of Kronos as time (Χρόνος), and Rhea as the flowing (Rheon) of the watery substance. 

ὅτι χρόνῳ φερομένη ἡ ὕλη ἅπασα ὥσπερ ὠὸν τὸν πάντα περιέχοντα σφαιροειδῆ ἀπεκύησεν οὐρανόν· ὅπερ κατ’ ἀρχὰς τοῦ γονίμου μυελοῦ πλῆρες ἦν ὡς ἂν στοιχεῖα καὶ χρώματα παντοδαπὰ ἐκτεκεῖν δυνάμενον, καὶ ὅμως παντοδαπὴν ἐκ μιᾶς οὐσίας τε καὶ χρώματος ἑνὸς ἔφερε τὴν φαντασίαν. 

For the whole body of matter was borne about for some Time, before it brought forth, like an egg, the sphere-like, all-embracing heaven (Οὐρανός), which at first was full of productive marrow, so that it was able to produce out of itself elements and colours of all sorts, while from the one substance and the one colour it produced all kinds of forms. 

ὥσπερ γὰρ ἐν τῷ τοῦ ταὼ γεννήματι ἓν μὲν τοῦ ὠοῦ χρῶμα δοκεῖ, δυνάμει δὲ μυρία ἔχει ἐν ἑαυτῷ τοῦ μέλλοντος τελεσφορεῖσθαι χρώματα, οὕτως καὶ τὸ ἐξ ἀπείρου ὕλης ἀποκυηθὲν ἔμψυχον ὠὸν ἐκ τῆς ὑποκειμένης καὶ ἀεὶ ῥεούσης ὕλης κινούμενον παντοδαπὰς ἐκφαίνει τροπάς. 

For as a peacock's egg seems to have only one colour, while potentially it has in it all the colours of the animal that is to be, so this living egg, conceived out of infinite matter, when set in motion by the underlying and ever-flowing matter, produces many different forms. 

ἔνδοθεν γὰρ τῆς περιφερείας ζῷόν τι ἀρρενόθηλυ εἰδοποιεῖται προνοίᾳ τοῦ ἐνόντος ἐν αὐτῷ θείου πνεύματος, ὃν Φάνητα Ὀρφεὺς καλεῖ, ὅτι αὐτοῦ φανέντος τὸ πᾶν ἐξ | αὐτοῦ ἔλαμψεν, τῷ φέγγει τοῦ διαπρεπεστάτου τῶν στοιχείων πυρὸς ἐν τῷ ὑγρῷ τελεσφορουμένου. 

For within the circumference a certain living creature, which is both male and female, is formed by the skill of the indwelling divine spirit. This Orpheus calls Phanes, because when it appeared (Phaneis) the universe shone forth from it, with the lustre of that most glorious of the elements, fire, perfected in moisture. 

καὶ οὐκ ἄπιστον, ὅτι καὶ ἐπὶ λαμπυρίδων δείγματος ἕνεκα ἡ φύσις ἡμῖν ὁρᾶν ὑγρὸν φῶς ἐδωρήσατο. 

Nor is this incredible, since in glowworms nature gives us to see a moist light." 

### c6
Phanes and Pluto. 

τὸ μὲν οὖν πρωτοσύστατον ὠὸν ὑποθερμανθὲν ὑπὸ τοῦ ἔσωθεν ζῴου ῥήγνυται, ἔπειτα δὲ μορφωθὲν προέρχεται ὁποῖόν τι καὶ Ὀρφεὺς λέγει

"This egg, then, which was the first substance, growing somewhat hot, was broken by the living creature within, and then there took shape and came forth something; such as Orpheus also speaks of, where he says,

κρανίου σχισθέντος ᴗ ˗ πολυχανδέος ὠοῦ.

'when the capacious egg was broken,' etc.

καὶ οὕτω μεγάλῃ δυνάμει αὐτοῦ τοῦ προεληλυθότος φανέντος, τὸ μὲν κύτος τὴν ἁρμονίαν λαμβάνει καὶ τὴν διακόσμησιν ἴσχει, αὐτὸς δὲ ὥσπερ ἐπ’ ἀκρωρείας οὐρανοῦ προκαθέζεται καὶ ἐν ἀπορρήτοις τὸν ἄπειρον περιλάμπων αἰῶνα. 

"And so by the mighty power of that which appeared (Phaneis) and came forth, the globe attained coherency, and maintained order, while it itself took its seat, as it were, on the summit of heaven, there in ineffable mystery diffusing light through endless ages. 

ἡ δὲ τοῦ κύτους ἔνδοθεν γόνιμος ὑπολειφθεῖσα ὕλη, ὡς ἐν πολλῷ τῷ χρόνῳ ὑποκειμένης ἕως φυσικῆς ὑποζέουσα ἡ θερμότης † τὰς πάντων διέκρινεν οὐσίας. 

But the productive matter left inside the globe, separated the substances of all things. 

τὸ μὲν γὰρ κατώτερον αὐτῆς πρῶτον ὥσπερ ὑποστάθμη ὑπὸ τοῦ βάρους εἰς τὰ κάτω ὑποκεχώρηκεν, ὃ διὰ τὴν ὁλκότητα καὶ διὰ τὸ ἐμβριθὲς καὶ πολὺ τῆς ὑποκειμένης οὐσίας πλῆθος Πλούτωνα προσηγόρευσαν, ᾅδου τε καὶ νεκρῶν βασιλέα εἶναι ἀποφηνάμενοι.

For first its lower part, just like the dregs, sank downwards of its own weight; and this they called Pluto from its gravity, and weight, and great quantity (Polu) of underlying matter, styling it the king of Hades and the dead."

### c7
Poseidon, Zeus, and Metis. 

ταύτην μὲν οὖν τὴν πρώτην καὶ πολλήν, ῥυπαρὰν καὶ τραχεῖαν οὐσίαν ὑπὸ Κρόνου, τοῦ χρόνου, καταποθῆναι λέγουσιν φυσικῶς διὰ τὴν κάτω ὑπονόστησιν αὐτῆς. 

"When, then, they say that this primordial substance, although most filthy and rough, was devoured by Kronos, that is, time, this is to be understood in a physical sense, as meaning that it sank downwards. 

μετὰ δὲ τὴν πρώτην ὑποστάθμην τὸ συρρυὲν ὕδωρ καὶ πρώτῃ ἐπιπολάσαν ὑποστάσει Ποσειδῶνα προσηγόρευσαν. 

And the water which flowed together after this first sediment, and floated on the surface of the first substance, they called Poseidon. 

τὸ δὲ λοιπὸν τρίτον τὸ καθαρώτατον καὶ κορυφαιότατον ἅτε διαυγὲς ὂν πῦρ Ζῆνα ὠνόμασαν διὰ τὴν ἐν αὐτῷ ζέουσαν φύσιν· ἀνωφερὲς γὰρ ὂν τὸ πῦρ πρὸς μὲν τὰ κάτω ὑπὸ χρόνου, τοῦ Κρόνου, οὐ κατεπόθη, ἀλλ’ (ὡς ἔφην) ἡ πυρώδης οὐσία ζωτική τε καὶ ἀνωφερὴς οὖσα εἰς αὐτὸν ἀνέπτη τὸν ἀέρα, ὃς καὶ φρονιμώτατός ἐστι διὰ τὴν καθαρότητα. 

And then what remained, the purest and noblest of all, for it was translucent fire, they called Zeus, from its glowing (Zeousa) nature, Now since fire ascends, this was not swallowed, and made to descend by time or Kronos; 

but, as I said, the fiery substance, since it has life in it, and naturally ascends, flew right up into the air, which from its purity is very intelligent. 

τῇ οὖν ἰδίᾳ θερμότητι ὁ Ζεύς ˗˗˗ τουτέστιν ἡ ζέουσα οὐσία ˗˗˗ τὸ καταλειφθὲν ἐν τῷ ὑποκειμένῳ ὑγρῷ τὸ ἰσχνότατον καὶ θεῖον ἀνιμᾶται πνεῦμα, ὅπερ Μῆτιν ἐκάλεσαν.

By his own proper heat, then, Zeus - that is, the glowing substance - draws up what is left in the underlying moisture, to wit, that very strong and divine spirit which they called Metis."  

### c8
Pallas and Hera. 

κατὰ κορυφῆς δὲ αὐτοῦ ἐλθὸν τοῦ αἰθέρος καὶ συνποθὲν ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ, ὥσπερ ὑγρὸν θερμῷ μιγέν, τὸν ἀεικίνητον παλμὸν ἐνποιῆσαν γεννᾷ τὴν σύνεσιν, ἣν καὶ Παλλάδα ἐπονομάζουσιν διὰ τὸ πάλλεσθαι, τεχνικωτάτην οὖσαν φρόνησιν, ᾗ χρώμενος τὸν πάντα ἐτεχνήσατο κόσμον ὁ αἰθέριος τεχνίτης. 

"And this, when it had reached the summit of the aether, was devoured by it (moisture being mixed with heat, so to say); and causing in it that ceaseless palpitation, it begat intelligence, which they call Pallas from this palpitating (Pallesthai). And this is artistic wisdom, by which the aetherial artificer wrought out the whole world. 

ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ δὲ τοῦ διήκοντος Διός τοῦ θερμοτάτου αἰθέρος, ὁ ἀὴρ μέχρι τῶν ἐνταῦθα διικνεῖται τόπων, ἣν ἐπονομάζουσιν Ἥραν. 

And from all-pervading Zeus, that is, from this very hot aether, air (Aer) extends all the way to our earth; and this they call Hera. 

καὶ ὡς δὴ τῆς τοῦ αἰθέρος καθαρωτάτης οὐσίας ὑποβεβηκυῖα, ὡς θήλεια τὴν καθαρότητα πρὸς σύγκρισιν τοῦ κρείττονος, ἀδελφὴ Διὸς κατὰ τὸ εἰκὸς ἐνομίσθη, ὡς ἐκ τῆς αὐτῆς οὐσίας γεγενημένη· γαμετὴ δὲ διὰ τὸ ὡς γυναῖκα ὑποκεῖσθαι.

Wherefore, because it has come below the aether, which is the purest substance (just as a woman, as regards purity, is inferior), when the two were compared to see which was the better, she was rightly regarded as the sister of Zeus, in respect of her origin from the same substance, but as his spouse, as being inferior like a wife.”  

(The following three chapters are not included by Kern:

Artemis

παραλαμβάνεται δὲ ἡ μὲν Ἥρα πρὸς ἀέρων εὐκρασίαν, διὸ καὶ γονιμωτάτη ἐστίν· ἡ δὲ Ἀθηνᾶ, ἣν καὶ Παλλάδα λέγουσιν, διὰ τὸ ἄκρως θερμὸν γένεσίν τινος ποιῆσαι μὴ δυναμένη, παρθένος ἐνομίσθη. 

"And Hera we understand to be a happy tempering of the atmosphere, and therefore she is very fruitful; but Athena, as they call Pallas, was reckoned a virgin, because on account of the intense heat she could produce nothing. 

ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ Ἄρτεμις ἑρμηνευομένη, ἣν εἰς τὸν κατώτατον μυχὸν τοῦ ἀέρος παραλαμβάνουσιν, καὶ δι’ ἀκρότητα κρύους ἄγονον οὖσαν ὁμοίως παρθένον ἐκάλεσαν. 

And in a similar fashion Artemis is explained: for her they take as the lowest depth of air, and so they called her a virgin, because she could not bear anything on account of the extreme cold. 

Διόνυσον δὲ ὡς φρενῶν θολωτικὸν ὀνομάζουσιν τὴν ἀπὸ τῶν ἄνω τε καὶ κάτω ἀτμῶν θολερὰν καὶ μεθύουσαν σύστασιν. 

And that troubled and drunken composition which arises from the upper and lower vapours they called Dionysus, as troubling the intellect. 

τὸ δὲ κατωτέρω τῆς γῆς ὕδωρ, ἓν ὂν τῇ φύσει καὶ διὰ πάντων τῶν χερσαίων πόρων διεῖρον καὶ εἰς πολλὰ διαιρούμενον (ὥσπερ συγκοπτόμενον), Ὄσιριν ἐκάλεσαν. 

And the water under the earth, which is in nature indeed one, but which flows through all the paths of earth, and is divided into many parts, they called Osiris, as being cut in pieces. 

λαμβάνουσι δὲ καὶ Ἄδωνιν εἰς ὡραίους καρπούς, Ἀφροδίτην εἰς μίξιν καὶ γένεσιν, Δήμητρα εἰς γῆν, Κόρην εἰς σπέρματα καὶ Διόνυσόν τινες εἰς ἄμπελον.

And they understand Adonis as favourable seasons, Aphrodite as coition and generation, Demeter as the earth, the Girl (Proserpine) as seeds; and Dionysus some understand as the vine."

All Such Stories Are Allegorical

καὶ πάντα τὰ τοιαῦτα ὁμοίως τοιαύτην τινὰ ἀλληγορίαν ἔχοντα νόει μοι· Ἀπόλλωνα δὲ ἥλιον τὸν περιπολοῦντα εἶναι νόμιζε, γονὴν ὄντα τοῦ Διός, ὃν καὶ Μίθραν ἐκάλεσαν, ἐνιαυτοῦ συμπληροῦντα περίοδον. 

"And I must ask you to think of all such stories as embodying some such allegory. Look on Apollo as the wandering Sun (peri-polôn), a son of Zeus, who was also called Mithras, as completing the period of a year. 

αὗται δὲ αἱ μεταμορφώσεις τοῦ πανταχῆ διήκοντος Διὸς αἱ πολλαὶ νοείσθωσάν σοι τροπαί, τὰς δὲ μυρίας αὐτοῦ γυναῖκας ἐνιαυτοὺς ἢ γενεὰς ἐπινόει. 

And these said transformations of the all-pervading Zeus must be regarded as the numerous changes of the seasons, while his numberless wives you must understand to be years, or generations. 

ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ γὰρ τοῦ αἰθέρος ἡ διικνουμένη τὸν ἀέρα δύναμις ἑκάστῳ ἐνιαυτῷ καὶ γενεᾷ συνουσιάζουσα διαφόρως αὐτὸν τρέπει καὶ οὕτως γεννᾷ ἢ φθείρει τὰ ὡραῖα. 

For the power which proceeds from the æther and passes through the air unites with all the years and generations in turn, and continually varies them, and so produces or destroys the crops. 

καὶ παῖδες μὲν λέγονται οἱ ὡραῖοι καρποί, αἱ δὲ πρὸς τοὺς ἄρρενας μίξεις αἱ κατ’ ἐνίους καιροὺς ἀκαρπίαι.

And ripe fruits are called his children, the barrenness of some seasons being referred to unlawful unions."

Clement Has Heard All This Before

Ταῦτα τοῦ Ἀππίωνος ἀλληγοροῦντος, σύννους ὢν ἐγὼ ἔδοξα τοῖς ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ λεγομένοις μὴ παρακολουθεῖν, διὸ τὸν λόγον ἐγκόψας ἔφη μοι· Εἰ μὴ παρακολουθεῖς οἷς λέγω, τί καὶ τὴν ἀρχὴν διαλέγομαι; 

"While Apion was allegorizing in this way, I became plunged in thought, and seemed not to be following what he was saying. So he interrupted his discourse, and said to me, If you do not follow what I am saying, why should I speak at all? 

κἀγὼ ἀπεκρινάμην· Μή με ὑπολάμβανε ἀναισθήτως ἔχειν τῶν ὑπὸ σοῦ λεγομένων· πάνυ γὰρ αὐτὰ συνίημι, ἅτε δὴ οὐ πρῶτον αὐτῶν ἀκηκοώς. 

And I answered, Do not suppose that I do not understand what you say. I understand it thoroughly; and that the more that this is not the first time I have heard it. 

ἵνα δὲ γνῷς ὅτι οὐκ ἀγνοῶ τὰ ὑπὸ σοῦ λεγόμενα, τὰ μὲν σοὶ ῥηθέντα ἐπιτεμοῦμαι, τῶν δὲ παραλειφθέντων σοι κατὰ ἀκολουθίαν, ὡς παρ’ ἑτέρων ἤκουσα, ἀποπληρώσω τὰς ἀλληγορίας. 

And that you may know that I am not ignorant of these things, I shall epitomize what you have said, and supply in their order, as I have heard them from others, the allegorical interpretations of those stories you have omitted. 

καὶ ὁ Ἀππίων ἔφη· Ποίησον οὕτως ὡς λέγεις.

And Apion said: 'Do so.' "

Epitome of Apion's Explanation. 

κἀγὼ (sc. Κλήμης) ἀπεκρινάμην· Παρίημι νῦν ἐπ’ ἀκριβὲς λέγειν τὸ ἐκ τῆς ἀπείρου ὕλης κατὰ ἐπιτυχίαν κράσεως ἀποκυηθὲν ἔμψυχον ὠόν, οὗ ῥαγέντος κατά τινας ἀρρενόθηλυς ἐξέθορεν Φάνης. 

“And I answered: ‘l shall not at present speak particularly of that living egg, which was conceived by a happy combination out of infinite matter, and from which, when it was broken, the masculo-feminine Phanes leaped forth, as some say. 

καὶ πάντ’ ἐκεῖνα ἐπιτέμνομαι, μέχρις οὗ τὸ ῥαγὲν κύτος τὴν ἁρμονίαν ἔλαβεν, ὑπολειφθείσης αὐτοῦ μυελώδους ὕλης.

I say little about all that, up to the point when this broken globe attained coherency, there being left in it some of its marrow-like matter.’ "
