The sages said:

O Sūta, it behoves you now to recount the manvantaras in the Vārāha kalpa and in all the later kalpas as also recount the Siddhas in the Vaivasvata manvantara.
### 22-28


Sūta said:
22-28. The first Manu was (1) Svāyambhuva son of Brahmā. Then, O brahmins, was the Manu (2) Svārociṣa. The subsequent Manus were: (3) Uttama, (4) Tāmasa, (5) Raivata, (6) Cākṣuṣa, (7) Vaivasvata, (8) Sāvarṇi, (9) Dharma, (10) Sāvarṇika, (11) Piśaṅga, (12) Apiśaṅgābha, (13) Śabala, and (14) Varṇaka. The Manus are also designated according to the vowels beginning with ‘a’ and ending with ‘au’. O excellent brahmins, they are also classified according to their colours as (1) śveta (white), (2) pāṇḍu (grey), (3) rakta (reddish), (4) tāmra (copper-hued), (5) pīta (yellow), (6) kapila (tawny), (7) kṛṣṇa (black), (8) śyāma (dark), (9) dhūmra (light-smoke-coloured), (10) sudhūmra (deep smoke-coloured), (11) apiśaṅga (non-tawny) (12) piśaṅga (tawny), (13) trivarṇaśabala (three-coloured) and (14) kālandhura (extreme black). Thus all the holy Manus have been mentioned by (1) name, (2) letters, and (3) colour. Those identical with the vowels are, in brief, mentioned as the leaders of the manvantaras. Among them, the seventh Manu is Vaivasvata represented by the vowel ‘ṛ’ and colour black. This seventh Manu is also a leader among devas. I shall mention the yogins in this repeated cycle of yugas in the kalpas that have passed by and those that are yet to come.
### 27-35


The current kalpa in the seventh manvantara is known as Vārāha. Now listen to the yogic incarnations of the lord and their line of disciples in due order, in all the kalpas and manvantaras. In the first Kali of Svāyambhuva Manu they were (1) Śveta, (2) Sutāra, (3) Madana, (4) Suhotra, (5) Kaṅkaṇa, (6) Logākṣi, (7) Jaigīṣavya, (8) Dadhivāhana, (9) Ṛṣabha, (10) Ugra, (11) Atri, (12) Subālaka, (13) Gautama, (14) Vedaśīrṣa. (15) Gokarṇa, (16) Guhāvāsin, (17) Śikhaṇḍabhṛt, (18) Jaṭāmālin, (19) Aṭṭahāsa, (20) Dāruka, (21) Lāṅguli. (22) Mahākāvya, (23) Śūlin, (24) Daṇḍin, (25) Muṇḍīśvara, (26) Sahiṣṇu, (27) Somaśarmā, (28) Lakulīśa. O men of holy rites, the incarnations as Yogācāryas of the lord in all the cycles of four ages in the Vaivasvata manvantara have been recounted (as twenty-eight).

### 124b-133


124b-133. When the twenty-eighth cycle of four yugas occurs in due order, the glorious son of Parāśara named Dvaipāyana[25] will become a Vyāsa. He is Viṣṇu himself, the grandfather of the worlds. At that time, Vāsudeva, black in colour and the best among men and exalted among the Yadus, will be born of Vasudeva. 

At the same time, by the power of my yogic illusion I the Yogātman will be born as Brahmacārin and inspire awe among the people. On seeing a dead body left in the cremation ground without a claimant, I shall be entering it by the yogic power for the welfare of the brahmins. Along with you and Viṣṇu[26] I will enter the divine and holy cave of the Meru.[27] O Brahmā, at that time, I will be known as Lakuli. That holy place where I entered the dead body will be known as Kāyāvatāra—a name that will last as long as the earth lasts. There too the ascetic sons will be born to me. They will be known as Kuśika, Garga, Mitra and Kauruṣya. They will be great yogic souls and brahmins who will have mastered all the Vedas. They will remain celibate and free from impurities. After attaining the yoga of Maheśvara they will go to Rudra’s world, never to return.

10-12. Brahmā crowned the Plakṣa and Aśvattha as the lords of trees; he made Citraratha the lord of Gandharvas, Vidyādharas and Kinnaras; Vāsuki of terrible vigour as the lord of Serpents and Takṣaka of terrible vigour as the lord of Sarpas (Cobras). He made the leading elephant Airāvata of terrible valour the lord of elephants. He made Garuḍa the lord of birds. He made Uccaiśśravas (the horse of Indra) the king of horses.

13 He made the lion the lord of animals; the bull the lord of the kine and Śarabha (the fabulous eight-footed beast) the lord of lions; the incomprehensible Guha the lord of all commanders-in-chief and Lakulīśa the lord of Śrutis and Smṛtis.
