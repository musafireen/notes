Ad vs. 1 v. Πρός Αυτόλυκον τοῦ Θεοφίλου Ἀντιοχείας III 17 p. 128 b (230 Otto):

οὐχὶ καὶ οἱ ποιηταὶ Ὅμηρος καὶ Ἡσίοδος καὶ Ὀρφεὺς ἔφασαν ἑαυτοὺς ἀπὸ θείας προνοίας μεμαθηκέναι;

“And did not the poets Homer and Hesiod and Orpheus profess that they themselves had been instructed by Divine Providence?” (trans. Marcus Dods, 1885)

et fr. 49 init.; ad vs. 3 cf. cod. Monac. 70 Hermeticum ab Heegio Catal. codic. astrol. graec. VIII 2, 156, 6 editum:

ὁρκίζω σε Ἥλιε ἄψαυστε, ἀκατέργαστε, ἡμεροφεγγής, εἰς τὸν χρονικόν σου κύκλον καὶ εἰς τοὺς τέσσαράς σου καιροὺς καὶ εἰς τὴν ὁδόν σου καὶ εἰς τὰς ἀκτῖνάς σου καὶ εἰς τὰς πτέρυγάς σου καὶ εἰς τὰς ἐνεργείας σου καὶ εἰς τὰ ὀνόματά σου ταῦτα·

“I beseech you oh sacred Ílios (Ἥλιος), untarnished, shining through the day, to your circle of time, your four seasons, your (celestial) road, your beams, your wings, your activities, and to your (many) names: etc.” (trans. by the author)
