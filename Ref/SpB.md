योषा वा आपो वृब्षाग्निर्मिथुनमेवैतत्प्रजननं क्रियत एवमिव हि मिथुनं कल्पितमुत्तरतो हि स्त्री पुमांसमुपशेते

He then carries it north of the Ahavaniya fire. For water is female and fire is male: hence a copulation productive of offspring is thereby effected. And in this way alone a regular copulation can take place, since the woman lies on the left (or north) side of the man.

The gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Prajapati, were contending for superiority. Then the gods were worsted, and the Asuras thought: 'To us alone assuredly belongs this world!

They thereupon said: “Well then, let us divide this world between us; and having divided it, let us subsist thereon!” They accordingly set about dividing it with ox-hides from west to east.

The gods then heard of this, and said: “The Asuras are actually dividing this earth: come, let us go to where the Asuras are dividing it. For what would become of us, if we were to get no share in it?” Placing Vishnu, (in the shape of) this very sacrifice, at their head, they went (to the Asuras).

They then said: “Let us share in this earth along with yourselves! Let a part of it be ours!” The Asuras replied rather grudgingly: “As much as this Vishnu lies upon, and no more, we give you!”
##### 5
वामनो  ह  विष्नुरास  |  तद्देवा  न  जिहीडिरे  महद्वै  नऽदुर्ये  नो  यज्ञसंमितमदुरिति

Now Vishnu was a dwarf. The gods, however, were not offended at this, but said: “Much indeed they gave us, who gave us what is equal in size to the sacrifice.”

सऽयं  विष्णुर्ग्लानः  |  चन्दोभिरभितः  परिगृहीतऽग्निपुरस्तान्नापक्रमणमास  स  तत एवौषधीनाम्  मूलान्युपमुम्लोच

Thereupon this Vishnu became tired; but being enclosed on all (three) sides by the metres, with the fire on the east, there was no (means of) escaping: he then hid himself among the roots of plants.

With six sacred words he draws around the first line of enclosure, with six the second: thus (together) twelvefold, for twelve no doubt are the months of the year; and the year, as Prajapati, is the sacrifice. As large as the sacrifice, as wide as its extent is, so wide does he thereby enclose it.

“Let it (the altar) measure a fathom across on the west side,” they say: that, namely, is the size of a man, and it (the altar) should be of (the) man’s size. “Three cubits long (should be) the "easterly line," for threefold is the sacrifice,” (so they say, but) in this there is no (fixed) measure: let him make it as long as he thinks fit in his own mind!
##### 15

The two shoulders (of the altar) he carries along both sides of the (Ahavaniya) fire. For the altar (vedi, fem.) is female and the fire (agni, masc.) is male; and the woman lies embracing the man: thereby a copulation productive of offspring is obtained. For this reason he carries the two shoulders (of the altar) along both sides of the fire.

##### 17

It should be sloping towards east, for the east is the quarter of the gods; and also sloping towards north, for the north is the quarter of men. To the south side he sweeps the rubbish (loose soil), for that is the quarter of the deceased ancestors. If it (the altar) were sloping towards south, the sacrificer would speedily go to yonder world; and thus (by making the altar in the prescribed way) the sacrificer lives for a long time: for this reason he sweeps the loose soil to the south side. Let him then cover it (the altar) over with (fresh) rubbish: for rubbish means cattle, and well-stocked with cattle he thereby makes it.

##### 18

He (the Agnidhra) smooths it down (from east to west). The gods, namely, when they were preparing for the contest, said to one another: “Come, let us remove to the moon for safety what imperishable place of worship there is on this earth; so that if the Asuras, on vanquishing us, should drive us away from here, we may afterwards, by praising and mortifying, prevail again!” They accordingly removed to the moon what imperishable place of worship there was on this earth. That now is the black (spots) in the moon: hence they say, “In the moon is the place of worship for this earth.” It is in this place of worship also that his sacrifice is performed: for that reason he smooths (the altar) down

The gods thereupon said to Brihaspati Aṅgirasa, “Verily, unbelief has come upon men; ordain thou the sacrifice to them!” Brihaspati Aṅgirasa then went and said, “How comes it that you do not sacrifice?” They replied, “From a desire for what should we sacrifice, since those who sacrifice become more sinful, and those who sacrifice not become righteous?”

##### 26

Brihaspati Aṅgirasa then said, “What we have heard of as produced for the gods that is this sacrifice, that is to say, the cooked oblations and the prepared altar; therewith you have performed while touching: that is why you have become more sinful. Sacrifice therefore without touching, for thus you will become righteous!” 'How long?' they asked. “Till the spreading of the sacrificial grass (on the altar),” he said. By the sacrificial grass, namely, it (the altar) becomes appeased. If, therefore, before the spreading of the sacrificial grass anything were to fall on it, let him only remove it at the time when he spreads the sacrificial grass; for when they spread the sacrificial grass, then they also step on it with the foot. He who knowing this sacrifices without touching, becomes indeed righteous: let him therefore sacrifice, without touching (the altar and oblations).

Mathava, the Videgha, was at that time on the (river) Sarasvati. He (Agni) thence went burning along this earth towards the east; and Gotama Rahugana and the Videgha Mathava followed after him as he was burning along. He burnt over (dried up) all these rivers. Now that (river), which is called 'Sadanira,' flows from the northern (Himalaya) mountain: that one he did not burn over. That one the Brahmans did not cross in former times, thinking, “it has not been burnt over by Agni Vaishvanara.”

They went on praising and toiling; for by (religious) toil, the gods indeed gained what they wished to gain, and (so did) the Rishis. Now whether it be that the gods caused it (the sacrifice) to attract (or, peep forth to) them, or whether they took to it of their own accord, they said, “Come, let us go to the place whence the gods obtained possession of the world of heaven!” They went about saying (to one another), “What attracts? What attracts?” and came upon the sacrificial cake which had become a tortoise and was creeping about. Then they all thought, “This surely must be the sacrifice!”

They said, “Stand still for the Ashvins! stand still for Sarasvati! stand still for Indra!” still it crept on;—“Stand still for Agni!” at this it stopped. Having then enveloped it in fire (Agni), knowing, as they did, that it had stopped for Agni, they Offered it up entirely, for it was an oblation to the gods. Then the sacrifice pleased them; they produced it, they spread it. And this same sacrifice is taught by the former to the later; the father (teaches it) to his son when he is a student (brahmacarin).

And since it so developed whilst rolling onwards (vrit), it became Vritra; and since he sprang forth footless, therefore he was a serpent. Danu and Danayu received him like mother and father, whence they call him Danava.

Asuri, on the other hand, said: “By means of the two butter-portions he gains any two (of those objects); by means of the low-voiced offering he obtains any (other) two; and by means of the rice-cake he obtains any (other) two: "all has been obtained, all has been conquered by me! with that All I will slay Vritra; with the All I will slay the spiteful enemy!" thus he thinks, and for that reason there is this manifold performance.”

By means of that low-voiced offering the gods stealing near slew, with that thunderbolt, the vashat-call, whichever they wished of the Asuras; and so does this one, after stealing near by means of that low-voiced offering, slay with that thunderbolt, the vashat-call, the wicked, spiteful enemy. This is why he performs the low-voiced offering.

When he (the sacrificer) is about to enter upon the fast of the full-moon ceremony, he may not be entirely sated. He therefore now compresses (that part of) his belly which relates to the Asuras; and next morning, by means of the oblations, that which relates to the gods. Now the practice regarding the full-moon ceremony is as follows:

The gods then said to this god who rules over the beasts (Rudra), “This one, surely, commits a sin who acts thus towards his own daughter, our sister. Pierce him!” Rudra, taking aim, pierced him. Half of his seed fell to the ground. And thus it came to pass.

Accordingly it has been said by the Rishi with reference to that (incident), “When the father embraced his daughter, uniting with her, he dropped his seed on the earth.” This (became) the chant (uktha) called agnimaruta; in (connection with) this it is set forth how the gods caused that seed to spring. When the anger of the gods subsided, they cured Prajapati and cut out that dart of this. (Rudra); for Prajapati, doubtless, is this sacrifice.

Let him not eat (the flesh) of either the cow or the ox; for the cow and the ox doubtless support everything here on earth. The gods spake, “Verily, the cow and the ox support everything here: come, let us bestow on the cow and the ox whatever vigour belongs to other species!”

Accordingly they bestowed on the cow and the ox whatever vigour belonged to other species (of animals); and therefore the cow and the ox eat most. Hence, were one to eat (the flesh) of an ox or a cow, there would be, as it were, an eating of everything, or, as it were, a going on to the end (or, to destruction). 

तं हाद्भुतमभिजनितोर्जायायै गर्भं निरबधीदिति  

Such a one indeed would be likely to be born (again) as a strange being, (as one of whom there is) evil report, such as 'he has expelled an embryo from a woman,'

They lay hands on the barren cow, and having laid hands on it, they quiet it.

He then puts on shoes of boar’s skin. Now the gods once put a pot of ghee on the fire. There from a boar was produced: hence the boar is fat for it was produced from ghee. Hence also cows readily take to a boar: it is indeed their own essence (life-sap, blood) they are readily taking to. Thus he firmly establishes himself in the essence of the cattle: therefore he puts on shoes of boar’s skin.

Looking down on this (earth) he then mutters, 'O mother Earth, injure me not, nor I thee!’ For the Earth was once afraid of Varuna, when he had been consecrated, thinking, ‘ Something great surely has he become now that he has been consecrated: I fear lest he may rend me asunder! And Varuna also was afraid of the Earth, thinking, I fear lest she may shake me off ! Hence by that (formula) he entered into a friendly relation with her; for a mother does not injure her son, nor does a son injure his mother.

स यो यम् मध्ये प्राणः एष एवेन्द्रस्तानेष प्राणान्मैन्द्र इत्याचक्षते परो ऽक्षम् परोऽक्षकामा हि देवास्त इद्धाः सप्त नाना पुरुषानसृजन्त

This same vital air in the midst doubtless is Indra. He, by his power (indriya), kindled those (other) vital airs from the midst; and inasmuch as he kindled (indh), he is the kindler (indha): the kindler indeed,—him they call 'Indra' mystically (esoterically), for the gods love the mystic. They (the vital airs), being kindled, created seven separate persons (purusha).

They said, “Surely, being thus, we shall not be able to generate: let us make these seven persons one Person!” They made those seven persons one Person: they compressed two of them (into) what is above the navel, and two of them (into) what is below the navel; (one) person was (one) wing (or side), (one) person was (the other) wing, and one person was the base (i.e. the feet).

And what excellence, what life-sap (rasa) there was in those seven persons, that they concentrated above, that became his head. And because (in it) they concentrated the excellence (shri), therefore it is (called) the head (shiras). It was thereto that the breaths resorted (shri): therefore also it is the head (shiras). And because the breaths did so resort (shri) thereto, therefore also the breaths (vital airs, and their organs) are elements of excellence (shri). And because they resorted to the whole (system) therefore (this is called) body (sharira).

Now this Person Prajapati desired, “May I be more (than one), may I be reproduced!” He toiled, he practised austerity. Being worn out with toil and austerity, he created first of all the Brahman (neut.), the triple science. It became to him a foundation: hence they say, “the Brahman (Veda) is the foundation of everything here.” Wherefore, having studied (the Veda) one rests on a foundation; for this, to wit, the Veda, is his foundation. Resting on that foundation, he (again) practised austerity.

He created the waters out of Vac (speech, that is) the world; for speech belonged to it: that was created (set free). It pervaded everything here; and because it pervaded (ap) whatsoever there was here, therefore (it is called) water (apah); and because it covered (var), therefore also it (is called) water (var).

He desired, “May I be reproduced from these waters!” He entered the waters with that triple science. Thence an egg arose. He touched it. “Let it exist! let it exist and multiply!” so he said. From it the Brahman (neut.) was first created, the triple science. Hence they say, “The Brahman (n.) is the first-born of this All.” For even before that Person the Brahman was created: it was created as his mouth. Hence they say of him who has studied the Veda, that 'he is like Agni;' for it, the Brahman (Veda), is Agni’s mouth.

Now the embryo which was inside was created as the foremost (agri): inasmuch as it was created foremost (agram) of this All, therefore (it is called) Agri: Agri, indeed, is he whom they mystically call Agni; for the gods love the mystic. And the tear (ashru, n.) which had formed itself became the 'ashru' (m.): “ashru” indeed is what they mystically call 'ashva' (horse), for the gods love the mystic. And that which, as it were, cried (ras), became the ass (rasabha). And the juice which was adhering to the shell (of the egg) became the he-goat (aja). And that which was the shell became the earth.

He desired, “May I generate, this (earth) from these waters!” He compressed it and threw it into the water. The juice which flowed from it became a tortoise; and that which was spirted upwards (became) what is produced above here over the wafers. This whole (earth) dissolved itself all over the water: all this (universe) appeared as one form only, namely, water.

And, again, why the Vishnu-strides and the Vatsapra rite are (performed). By the Vishnu-strides Prajapati drove up to heaven. He saw that unyoking-place, the Vatsapra, and unyoked thereat to prevent chafing; for when the yoked (beast) is not unloosed, it is chafed. In like manner the Sacrificer drives up to heaven by the Vishnu-strides; and unyokes by means of the Vatsapra.

He then puts down a (living) tortoise;—the tortoise means life-sap: it is life-sap (blood) he thus bestows on (Agni). This tortoise is that life-sap of these worlds which flowed away from them when plunged into the waters: that (life-sap) he now bestows on (Agni).

This triplet then is honey (madhu); and honey being life-sap, it is life-sap he thus puts into him (Agni). With three Gayatri verses (he performs): the significance of this has been explained.

स एतै रूपैर्नाशक्नोत्स एतं वयोविधमात्मानमपश्यदग्निं तं व्यधत्त

by means of these forms he could not do so. He saw this bird-like body, the fire-altar, and constructed it.

When he was first speaking Prajapati spoke (words) of one syllable and of two syllables; whence a child, when first speaking, speaks (words) of one syllable and of two syllables.

These (three words consist of), five syllables: he made them to be the five seasons, and thus there are these five seasons. At the end of the (first) year, Prajapati rose to stand on these worlds thus produced; whence a child tries to stand up at the end of a year, for at the end of a year Prajapati stood up.
##### 6
स  सहस्रायुर्जज्ञे  स  यथा  नद्यै  पारम्  परापश्येदेवं  स्वस्यायुषः  पारम्  पराचख्यौ

He was born with a life of a thousand years: even as one might see in the distance the opposite shore, so did he behold the opposite shore (the end) of his own life.

Desirous of offspring, he went on singing praises and toiling. He laid the power of reproduction into his own self. By (the breath of) his mouth he created the gods: the gods were created on entering the sky; and this is the godhead of the gods (deva) that they were created on entering the sky (div). Having created them, there was, as it were, daylight for him; and this also is the godhead of the gods that, after creating them, there was, as it were, daylight (diva) for him.
##### 8
अथ  यऽयमवाङ्  प्राणः  तेनासुरानसृजत  त इमामेव  पृथिवीमभिपद्यासृज्यन्त  तस्मै  ससृजानाय  तम इवास

And by the downward breathing he created the Asuras: they were created on entering this earth. Having created them there was, as it were, darkness for him.
##### 9

He knew, “Verily, I have created evil for myself since, after creating, there has come to be, as it were, darkness for me.” Even then he smote them with evil, and owing to this it was that they were overcome; whence people say, “Not true is that regarding (the fight between) the gods and Asuras which is related partly in the tale and partly in the legend; for it was even then that Prajapati smote them with evil, and it was owing to this that they were overcome.”
##### 10

Therefore it is with reference to this that the Rishi has said, “Not for a single day hast thou fought, nor hast thou any enemy, O Maghavan illusion is what they say concerning thy battles; no foe hast thou fought either to-day or aforetime.”
##### 11

Now what daylight, as it were, there was for him, on creating the gods, of that he made the day; and what darkness, as it were, there was for him, on creating the Asuras, of that he made the night: they are these two, day and night.

Prajapati bethought himself, “Everything (sarva), indeed, I have obtained by stealth (tsar) who have created these deities:” this became the 'sarvatsara,' for 'sarvatsara,' doubtless, is the same as 'samvatsara (year).' And, verily, whosoever thus knows 'samvatsara' to be the same as 'sarvatsara,' is not overcome by any evil which, by magic art, steals upon him (tsar); and whosoever thus knows 'samvatsara' to be the same as 'sarvatsara,' overcomes against whomsoever he practises magic art.

Prajapati bethought himself, “Verily, I have created here a counterpart of myself, to wit, the year;” whence they say, “Prajapati is the year;” for he created it to be a counterpart of himself: inasmuch as 'samvatsara (year),' as well as 'Prajapati,' consists of four syllables, thereby it (the year) is a counterpart of him.
##### 14
ता वा एताः प्रजापतेरधि देवता असृज्यन्ताग्निरिन्द्रः सोमः परमेष्ठी प्राजापत्यः

Now, these are the deities who were created out of Prajapati,—Agni, Indra, Soma, and Parameshthin Prajapatya.

They went on singing praises and toiling. Then Parameshthin, son of Prajapati, saw that sacrifice, the New and Full-moon offerings, and performed these offerings. Having performed them, he desired, “Would I were everything here!” He became the waters, for the waters are everything here, inasmuch as they abide in the furthest place; for he who digs here on earth finds indeed water; and, in truth, it is from that furthest place, to wit, from yonder sky that he rains, whence the name Parameshthin (abiding in the furthest, highest place).

Parameshthin spake unto his father Prajapati, “I have discovered a sacrifice which fulfils wishes: let me perform this for thee!”—“So be it!” he said. He accordingly performed it for him. Having sacrificed, he (Prajapati) desired, “Would I were everything here!” He became the breath (vital air), for breath is everything here: Prajapati is that breath which blows here (the wind); and whatsoever knows that it is thus he blows is his (Prajapati's) eyesight; and whatsoever is endowed with breath is Prajapati. And, verily, whosoever thus knows that eyesight of Prajapati becomes, as it were, manifest,

Prajapati spake unto his son Indra, “Let me perform for thee this wish-fulfilling sacrifice which Parameshthin has just performed for me.”—“So be it!” he said. He accordingly performed it for him. Having sacrificed, he (Indra) desired, “Would that I were everything here!” He became speech (vac), for speech is everything here; whence they say, “Indra is Vac.”

Indra spake unto his brothers Agni and Soma, “Let me perform for you this wish-fulfilling sacrifice which our father Prajapati has just performed for me.”—“So be it!” they said. He accordingly performed it for them. Having sacrificed, those two desired, “Would that we were everything here!” One of them became the eater of food, and the other became food: Agni became the eater of food, and Soma food; and the eater of food, and food, indeed, are everything here.
##### 29
अथाध्यात्मम् पञ्चेमे पुरुषे प्राणा ऋते चक्षुर्भ्यां त एव पञ्च प्रयाजा चक्षुषी आज्यभागौ

Now as to the body:—there are in man these five breathings, not including the eyes; they are the five fore-offerings, and the two butter-portions are the eyes.

Now, Shvetaketu Aruneya, who knew this, said once, “To him who will thus know that glory of the fore-offerings, people will in days to come be flocking from all sides as if wishing to see some great serpent.”

By means of the Surâ-liquor Namuki, the Asura, carried off Indra's (source of) strength, the essence of food, the Soma-drink. He (Indra) hasted up to the Asvins and Sarasvatî, crying, 'I have sworn to Namuki, saying, "I will slay thee neither by day nor by night, neither with staff nor with bow, neither with the palm of my hand nor with the fist, neither with the dry nor with the moist!" and yet has he taken these things from me: seek ye to bring me back these things!

And on the eighth day, after those (three) offerings have been performed in the same way, there is the same course of procedure. “Adhvaryu!” he (the Hotri) says.—“Havai hotar!” replies the Adhvaryu.—“King Matsya Sammada,” he says; 'his people are the water-dwellers, and they are staying here;'—both fish and fishermen have come thither: it is these he instructs;—“the Itihasa 3 is the Veda: this it is;” thus saying, let him tell some Itihasa. The Adhvaryu calls in the same way (on the masters of lute-players), but does not perform the Prakrama oblations.

Having uttered these two (verses), he pronounces what remains of the Adhrigu. “A cloth, an upper cloth, and gold,” this is what they spread out for the horse: thereon they 'quiet' (slaughter) it. When the victims have been 'quieted,' the (king's) wives come up with water for washing the feet,—four wives; and a young maiden as the fifth, and four hundred female attendants.

When the foot-water is ready, they cause the Mahishi to lie down near the horse, and cover her up with the upper cloth, with 'In heaven ye envelop yourselves,'—for that indeed is heaven where they immolate the victim, . . ., “May the vigorous male, the layer of seed, lay seed!” she says for the completeness of union.

And the Brahman addresses the Mahishi, “Mahishi, hey hey Mahishi, thy mother and father mount to the top of the tree . . .”—She has a hundred daughters of kings attending upon her: these reply to the Brahman, “Brahman, hey hey Brahman, thy mother and father play on the top of the tree. . .”

Purusha Narayana desired, “Would that I overpassed all beings! would that I alone were everything here (this universe)!” He beheld this five-days’ sacrificial performance, the Purushamedha, and took it, and performed offering therewith; and having performed offering therewith, he overpassed all beings, and became everything here.

And, again, as to why there are (the victims) of the set of eleven (stakes): it is for the sake of his obtaining and securing everything, for the set of eleven (stakes) is everything, since the set of eleven (stakes) is Prajapati, and Prajapati is everything, and the Purushamedha is everything.

Then (earth) torn up by a boar (he takes), with 'Only thus large was she in the beginning,'--for, indeed, only so large was this earth in the beginning, of the size of a span. A boar, called Emûsha, raised her up, and he was her lord Prajapati: with that mate, his heart's delight, he thus supplies and completes him;--'may I this day compass for you Makha's head on the Earth's place of divine worship: for Makha thee! for Makha's head thee!'
