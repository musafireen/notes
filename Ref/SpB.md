अथातऽशनानशनस्यैव  |  तदुहाषाढः  सावयसऽनशनमेव  व्रतम्  मेने  मनो  ह  वै  देवा  मनुष्यस्याजानन्ति  त एनमेतद्व्रतमुपयन्तं  विदुः  प्रातर्नो  यक्ष्यत इति  तऽस्य  विश्वे  देवा  गृहानागचन्ति  तऽस्य  गृहेषूपवसन्ति  स उपवसथः

Now then of the eating (or) fasting. And on this point Ashadha Savayasa, on the one hand, was of opinion that the vow consisted in fasting. For assuredly, (he argued,) the gods see through the mind of man; they know that, when he enters on this vow, he means to sacrifice to them the next morning. Therefore all the gods betake themselves to his house, and abide by (him or the fires, upa-vas) in his house; whence this (day) is called upa-vasatha.

ता उत्तरेणाहवनीयम् प्रणयति 
योषा वा आपो वृब्षाग्निर्मिथुनमेवैतत्प्रजननं क्रियत एवमिव हि मिथुनं कल्पितमुत्तरतो हि स्त्री पुमांसमुपशेते

He then carries it north of the Ahavaniya fire. For water is female and fire is male: hence a copulation productive of offspring is thereby effected. And in this way alone a regular copulation can take place, since the woman lies on the left (or north) side of the man.

Now in former times it was no other than the wife (of the sacrificer) who rose at this (call, to act) as Havishkrit; therefore now also (she or) some one (priest) rises in answer to this call. And at the time when he (the Adhvaryu) calls the Havishkrit, one of the priests beats the two mill-stones. The reason why they produce this discordant noise, is this:
##### 14
मनोर्ह वा ॠषभ आस तस्मिन्नसुरघ्नी सपत्नघ्नी वाक्प्रविष्टास तस्य ह स्म श्वसथाद्रवथादसुररक्षसानि मृद्यमानानि यन्ति ते हासुराः समूदिरे पापं वत नोऽयमृषभः सचते कथं न्विमं दभ्नुयामेति किलाताकुली इति हासुरब्रह्मावासतुः

Manu was in possession of a bull. Into him had entered an Asura-killing, foe-killing voice; and by his snorting and roaring the Asuras and Rakshas were continually being crushed. Thereupon the Asuras said to one another: “Evil, alas! this bull inflicts upon us! how can we possibly destroy him?” Now Kilata and Akuli were the two priests (brahman) of the Asuras.
##### 15
तौ होचतुः श्रद्धादेवी वै मनुरावं नु वेदावेति तौ हागत्योचतुर्मनो याजयाव त्वेति केनेत्यनेनर्षभेणेति तथेति तस्यालब्धस्य स वागपचक्राम

These two said, “God-fearing, they say, is Manu: let us two then ascertain!” They then went to him and said: “Manu! we will sacrifice for thee!” He said: “Wherewith?” They said: “With this bull!” He said: “So be it!” On his (the bull's) being killed the voice went from him.

It entered into Manavi, the wife of Manu; and when they heard her speak, the Asuras and Rakshas were continually being crushed. Thereupon the Asuras said to one another: “Hereby even greater evil is inflicted on us, for the human voice speaks more!” Kilata and Akuli then said: “God-fearing, they say, is Manu: let us then ascertain!” They went to him and said: “Manu! we will sacrifice for thee!” He said: “Wherewith?” They said: “With this thy wife!” He said: “So be it!” And on her being killed that voice went from her.

पुरुषं ह वै देवाः अग्रे पशुमालेभिरे 

At first, namely, the gods offered up a man as the victim. 

तस्यालब्धस्य मेधो ऽपचक्राम सो ऽश्व प्रविवेश 

When he was offered up, the sacrificial essence went out of him. It entered into the horse. 

ते ऽश्वमालभन्त 

They offered up the horse. 

तस्यालब्धस्य मेधो ऽपचक्राम स गाम् प्रविवेश 

When it was offered up, the sacrificial essence went out of it. It entered into the ox. 

ते गामा ... 

They offered up the ox. 

सो ऽविम् प्रविवेश ते ऽविमा ... 

When it was offered up, the sacrificial essence went out of it. It entered into the sheep. 

They offered up the sheep. 

म 

When it was offered up, the sacrificial essence went out of it. 

सो ऽजम् प्रविवेश 

It entered into the goat. 

ते ऽजमालभन्त 

They offered up the goat. 

तस्यालब्धस्य मेधो ऽपचक्राम

When it was offered up, the sacrificial essence went out of it.
##### 7
स इमम् पृथिवीम् प्रविवेश 

It entered into this earth. 

तं खनन्तैवान्वीषुस्तमन्वविन्दंस्ताविमौ व्रीहियवौ  

They searched for it, by digging. They found it (in the shape of) those two (substances), the rice and barley: 

तस्मादप्येतावेतर्हि खनन्त इवैवानुविन्दन्ति 

therefore even now they obtain those two by digging; 

स यावद्वीर्यवद्ध वा अस्यैते सर्वे पशव आलब्धाः 

and as much efficacy as all those sacrificed animal victims would have for him, 

स्युस्तावद्वीर्यवद्धास्य हविरेव भवति य एवमेतद्वेदात्रो 

so much efficacy has this oblation (of rice etc.) for him who knows this. 

सा सम्पद्यदाहुः पाङ्क्तः पशुरिति

And thus there is in this oblation also that completeness which they call 'the fivefold animal sacrifice.'

The gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Prajapati, were contending for superiority. Then the gods were worsted, and the Asuras thought: 'To us alone assuredly belongs this world!

ते  होचु  |  हन्तेमाम्  पृथिवीं  विभजामहै  तां  विभज्योपजीवामेति  तामौक्ष्णैश्चर्मभि  पश्चात्प्राञ्चो  विभजमाना  अभीयु

They thereupon said: “Well then, let us divide this world between us; and having divided it, let us subsist thereon!” They accordingly set about dividing it with ox-hides from west to east.
###### 3
तद्वै  देवा  शुश्रुवु  |  विभजन्ते  ह  वा इमामसुरा  पृथिवीम्  प्रेत  तदेष्यामो  यत्रेमामसुरा  विभजन्ते  के  ततः  स्याम  यदस्यै  न  भजेमहीति  ते  यज्ञमेव  विष्णुम्  पुरस्कृत्येयु

The gods then heard of this, and said: “The Asuras are actually dividing this earth: come, let us go to where the Asuras are dividing it. For what would become of us, if we were to get no share in it?” Placing Vishnu, (in the shape of) this very sacrifice, at their head, they went (to the Asuras).
###### 4

They then said: “Let us share in this earth along with yourselves! Let a part of it be ours!” The Asuras replied rather grudgingly: “As much as this Vishnu lies upon, and no more, we give you!”
##### 5
वामनो  ह  विष्नुरास  |  तद्देवा  न  जिहीडिरे  महद्वै  नऽदुर्ये  नो  यज्ञसंमितमदुरिति

Now Vishnu was a dwarf. The gods, however, were not offended at this, but said: “Much indeed they gave us, who gave us what is equal in size to the sacrifice.”

##### 8
सोऽयं  विष्णुर्ग्लानः  |  चन्दोभिरभितः  परिगृहीतोऽग्निपुरस्तान्नापक्रमणमास  स  तत एवौषधीनाम्  मूलान्युपमुम्लोच

Thereupon this Vishnu became tired; but being enclosed on all (three) sides by the metres, with the fire on the east, there was no (means of) escaping: he then hid himself among the roots of plants.

##### 13
षड्भिर्व्याहृतिभि  |  पूर्वम्  परिग्रह  परिगृह्णाति  षड्भिरुत्तरं  तद्द्वादश  कृत्वो  द्वादश  वै  मासा  संवत्सरस्य  संवत्सरो  यज्ञः  प्रजापति  स  यावानेव  यज्ञो  यावत्यस्य  मात्रा  तावतमेवैतत्परिगृह्णाति

With six sacred words he draws around the first line of enclosure, with six the second: thus (together) twelvefold, for twelve no doubt are the months of the year; and the year, as Prajapati, is the sacrifice. As large as the sacrifice, as wide as its extent is, so wide does he thereby enclose it.
##### 14

“Let it (the altar) measure a fathom across on the west side,” they say: that, namely, is the size of a man, and it (the altar) should be of (the) man’s size. “Three cubits long (should be) the "easterly line," for threefold is the sacrifice,” (so they say, but) in this there is no (fixed) measure: let him make it as long as he thinks fit in his own mind!
##### 15
अभितोऽग्निमंसा उन्नयति  |  योषा  वै  वेदिर्वृषाग्नि  परिगृह्य  वै  योषा  वृषाणं  शेते  मिथुनमेवैतत्प्रजननं  क्रियते  तस्मादभितोऽग्निमंसा उन्नयति

The two shoulders (of the altar) he carries along both sides of the (Ahavaniya) fire. For the altar (vedi, fem.) is female and the fire (agni, masc.) is male; and the woman lies embracing the man: thereby a copulation productive of offspring is obtained. For this reason he carries the two shoulders (of the altar) along both sides of the fire.

##### 17
सा  वै  प्राक्प्रवा  स्यात्  |  प्राची  हि  देवानां  दिगथो उदक्प्रवोदीची  हि  मनुष्याणां  दिग्दक्षिणतः  पुरीषम्  प्रत्युदूहत्येषा  वै  दिक्पिॄणां  सा  यद्दक्षिणाप्रवा  स्यात्  क्षिप्रे  ह  यजमानोऽमुं  लोकमियात्तथो  ह  यजमानो  ज्योग्जीवति  तस्माद्दक्षिणतः  पुरीषम्  प्रत्युदूहति  पुरीषवतीं  कुर्वीत  पशवो  वै  पुरीषम्  पशुमतीमेवैनामेतत्कुरुते

It should be sloping towards east, for the east is the quarter of the gods; and also sloping towards north, for the north is the quarter of men. To the south side he sweeps the rubbish (loose soil), for that is the quarter of the deceased ancestors. If it (the altar) were sloping towards south, the sacrificer would speedily go to yonder world; and thus (by making the altar in the prescribed way) the sacrificer lives for a long time: for this reason he sweeps the loose soil to the south side. Let him then cover it (the altar) over with (fresh) rubbish: for rubbish means cattle, and well-stocked with cattle he thereby makes it.

##### 18
ताम्  प्रतिमार्ष्टि  |  देवा  ह  वै  संग्रामं  संनिधास्यन्त  स्ते  होचुर्हन्त  यदस्यै  पृथिव्या  अनामृतं  देवयजनं  तच्चन्द्रमसि  निदधामहै  स  यदि  न इतोऽसुरा  जयेयुस्तत एवार्चन्तः  श्राम्यन्तः  पुनरभिभवेमेति  स  यदस्यै  पृथिव्या  अनामृतं  देवयजनमासीत्तच्चन्द्रमसि  न्यदधत  तदेतच्चन्द्रमसि  कृष्णं  तस्मादाहुश्चन्द्रमस्यस्यै  पृथिव्यै  देवयजनमित्यपि  ह  वा  अस्यैतस्मिन्देवयजन इष्टम्  भवति  तस्माद्वै  प्रतिमार्ष्टि

He (the Agnidhra) smooths it down (from east to west). The gods, namely, when they were preparing for the contest, said to one another: “Come, let us remove to the moon for safety what imperishable place of worship there is on this earth; so that if the Asuras, on vanquishing us, should drive us away from here, we may afterwards, by praising and mortifying, prevail again!” They accordingly removed to the moon what imperishable place of worship there was on this earth. That now is the black (spots) in the moon: hence they say, “In the moon is the place of worship for this earth.” It is in this place of worship also that his sacrifice is performed: for that reason he smooths (the altar) down
#### 25-26
##### 25
ते  ह  देवा ऊचु  |  बृहस्पतिमाङ्गिरसमश्रद्धा  वै  मनुष्यानबिदत्तेभ्यो  विधेहि  यज्ञमिति  स  हेत्योवाच  बृहस्पतिराङ्गिरसः  कथा  न  यजध्व इति  ते  होचु  किं  काम्या  यजेमहि  ये  यजन्ते  पापीयांसस्ते  भवन्ति  य उ  न  यजन्ते  श्रेयांसस्ते  भवन्तीति

The gods thereupon said to Brihaspati Aṅgirasa, “Verily, unbelief has come upon men; ordain thou the sacrifice to them!” Brihaspati Aṅgirasa then went and said, “How comes it that you do not sacrifice?” They replied, “From a desire for what should we sacrifice, since those who sacrifice become more sinful, and those who sacrifice not become righteous?”

##### 26
स  होवाच  |  बृहस्पतिराङ्गिरसो  यद्वै  शुश्रुम  देवानाम्  परिषूतं  तदेष  यज्ञो  भवति  यचूतानि  हवींषि  क्ल्प्ता  वेदिस्तेनावमर्शमचारिष्ट  तस्मात्पापीयांसोऽभूत्  तेनानवमर्श  यजध्वं  तथा  श्रेयांसो  भविष्यथेत्या  कियत इत्या  बर्हिष  स्तरादिति  बर्हिषा  ह  वै  खल्वेषा  शाम्यति  स  यदि  पुरा  बर्हिह्ष  स्तरात्किंचिदापद्येत  बर्हिरेव  तत्स्तृणन्नपास्येदथ  यदा  बर्हि  स्तृणन्त्यपि  पदाभितिष्ठन्ति  स  यो  हैवं  विद्वाननवमर्शं  यजते  श्रेयान्हैव  भवति  तस्मादनवमर्शमेव  यजेत

Brihaspati Aṅgirasa then said, “What we have heard of as produced for the gods that is this sacrifice, that is to say, the cooked oblations and the prepared altar; therewith you have performed while touching: that is why you have become more sinful. Sacrifice therefore without touching, for thus you will become righteous!” 'How long?' they asked. “Till the spreading of the sacrificial grass (on the altar),” he said. By the sacrificial grass, namely, it (the altar) becomes appeased. If, therefore, before the spreading of the sacrificial grass anything were to fall on it, let him only remove it at the time when he spreads the sacrificial grass; for when they spread the sacrificial grass, then they also step on it with the foot. He who knowing this sacrifices without touching, becomes indeed righteous: let him therefore sacrifice, without touching (the altar and oblations).

And (another reason) why he utters 'Hin!' is this. The word 'Hin' means breath, for the word Hin' does indeed mean breath: he cannot therefore pronounce the word 'Hin,' when he closes his nostrils. The ric (verse) he recites with his voice. Now, voice and breath are a pair, so that a productive union of the samidhenis is thereby effected at the outset: for this reason he recites, after uttering 'Hin!'
##### 10
 घृताच्येति विदेघो ह माथवोऽग्निं वैश्वानरम् मुखे बभार तस्य गोतमो राहूगण ऋषिः पुरोहित आस तस्मै ह स्मामन्त्र्यमाणो न प्रतिशृणोति नेन्मे ऽग्निर्वैश्वानरो मुखान्निष्पद्याता इति

With buttered (spoon)—” he adds. Now Mathava, the (king of) Videgha, carried Agni Vaishvanara in his mouth. The Rishi Gotama Rahugana was his family priest. When addressed (by the latter), he made no answer to him, fearing lest Agni might fall from his mouth.
##### 11
तमृग्भिर्ह्वयितुं दध्रे वीतिहोत्रं त्वा कवे द्युमन्तं समिधीमहि | अग्ने बृहन्तमध्वरे विदेघेति

He (the priest) began to invoke the latter with verses of the Rig-veda, “We kindle thee at the sacrifice, O wise Agni, thee the radiant, the mighty caller to the sacrificial feast ([[RV#5.26#3]])!—O Videgha!”
##### 13

Still he did not answer. (The priest continued), “Thee, O butter-sprinkled one, we invoke! [[RV#5.26#2]];” so much he uttered, when at the very mentioning of butter, Agni Vaishvanara flashed forth from the (king's) mouth: he was unable to hold him back; he issued from his mouth, and fell down on this earth.

Mathava, the Videgha, was at that time on the (river) Sarasvati. He (Agni) thence went burning along this earth towards the east; and Gotama Rahugana and the Videgha Mathava followed after him as he was burning along. He burnt over (dried up) all these rivers. Now that (river), which is called 'Sadanira,' flows from the northern (Himalaya) mountain: that one he did not burn over. That one the Brahmans did not cross in former times, thinking, “it has not been burnt over by Agni Vaishvanara.”
##### 15
तत एतर्हि प्राचीनम् बहवो ब्राह्मणास्तद्धाक्षेत्रतरमिवास स्रावितरमिवास्वदितमग्निना वैश्वानरेणेति

Now-a-days, however, there are many Brahmans to the east of it. At that time it (the land east of the Sadanira) was very uncultivated, very marshy, because it had not been tasted by Agni Vaishvanara.
##### 16
तदु हैतर्हि क्षेत्रतरमिव ब्राह्मणा उ हि नूनमेनद्यज्ञैरसिष्वदंत्सापि जघन्ये नैदाघे समिवैव कोपयति तावचीतानतिदग्धा ह्यग्निना वैश्वानरेण

Now-a-days, however, it is very cultivated, for the Brahmans have caused (Agni) to taste it through sacrifices. Even in late summer that (river), as it were, rages along: so cold is it, not having been burnt over by Agni Vaishvanara.
##### 17
स होवाच विदेघो माथवः क्वाहम् भवानीत्यत एव ते प्राचीनम् भुवनमिति होवाच सैषाप्येतर्हि कोसलविदेहानाम् मर्यादा ते हि माथवाः

Mathava, the Videgha, then said (to Agni), “Where am I to abide?” 'To the east of this (river) be thy abode!' said he. Even now this (river) forms the boundary of the Kosalas and Videhas; for these are the Mathavas (or descendants of Mathava).

“Like as Manu (did), like as Bharata;”—Manu, indeed, worshipped with sacrifice in olden times, and doing as he did these descendants of his now sacrifice: therefore he says 'like as Manu.' Or, say they, (it means) “at the sacrifice of Manu,” and therefore he says 'as (he did) with Manu.'

They went on praising and toiling; for by (religious) toil, the gods indeed gained what they wished to gain, and (so did) the Rishis. Now whether it be that the gods caused it (the sacrifice) to attract (or, peep forth to) them, or whether they took to it of their own accord, they said, “Come, let us go to the place whence the gods obtained possession of the world of heaven!” They went about saying (to one another), “What attracts? What attracts?” and came upon the sacrificial cake which had become a tortoise and was creeping about. Then they all thought, “This surely must be the sacrifice!”

They said, “Stand still for the Ashvins! stand still for Sarasvati! stand still for Indra!” still it crept on;—“Stand still for Agni!” at this it stopped. Having then enveloped it in fire (Agni), knowing, as they did, that it had stopped for Agni, they Offered it up entirely, for it was an oblation to the gods. Then the sacrifice pleased them; they produced it, they spread it. And this same sacrifice is taught by the former to the later; the father (teaches it) to his son when he is a student (brahmacarin).

Now that (cake), which caused the sacrifice to attract (or, appear to) them, first (puras) bestowed (dash) it upon them: hence it is (called) purodasha, for purodasha, doubtless, is the same as purodasha. This same cake on eight potsherds for Agni is indispensable on both occasions (at the new- and full-moon ceremonies).

They both said, “What (share) shall then be ours?” They replied, “For whatever deity they shall take out sacrificial food, they shall in the first place offer to you some clarified butter!” Whenever, therefore, they take out sacrificial food for any deity, they in the first place offer two butter-portions to Agni and Soma. This does not take place at the Soma-sacrifice, nor at the animal offering; for they said, “for whatever deity they take out . . ..”

Asuri, on the other hand, said: “By means of the two butter-portions he gains any two (of those objects); by means of the low-voiced offering he obtains any (other) two; and by means of the rice-cake he obtains any (other) two: "all has been obtained, all has been conquered by me! with that All I will slay Vritra; with the All I will slay the spiteful enemy!" thus he thinks, and for that reason there is this manifold performance.”

By means of that low-voiced offering the gods stealing near slew, with that thunderbolt, the vashat-call, whichever they wished of the Asuras; and so does this one, after stealing near by means of that low-voiced offering, slay with that thunderbolt, the vashat-call, the wicked, spiteful enemy. This is why he performs the low-voiced offering.

When he (the sacrificer) is about to enter upon the fast of the full-moon ceremony, he may not be entirely sated. He therefore now compresses (that part of) his belly which relates to the Asuras; and next morning, by means of the oblations, that which relates to the gods. Now the practice regarding the full-moon ceremony is as follows:

In reference to this point they say, “One who has not performed the Soma-sacrifice, must not offer the Sannayya; for, indeed, the Sannayya is (of the same significance as) a Soma libation, and the latter is not permitted to one who is not a Soma-sacrificer: hence he who has not performed the Soma-sacrifice, must not offer the Sannayya.”

The gods then said to this god who rules over the beasts (Rudra), “This one, surely, commits a sin who acts thus towards his own daughter, our sister. Pierce him!” Rudra, taking aim, pierced him. Half of his seed fell to the ground. And thus it came to pass.

Accordingly it has been said by the Rishi with reference to that (incident), “When the father embraced his daughter, uniting with her, he dropped his seed on the earth.” This (became) the chant (uktha) called agnimaruta; in (connection with) this it is set forth how the gods caused that seed to spring. When the anger of the gods subsided, they cured Prajapati and cut out that dart of this. (Rudra); for Prajapati, doubtless, is this sacrifice.

If he should utter any human sound before that time, let him there and then mutter some Ric or Yajus-text addressed to Vishnu; for Vishnu is the sacrifice, so that he thereby again obtains a hold on the sacrifice: and this is the expiation of that (breach of silence).

When he (the Adhvaryu) says, “Brahman, shall I step forward?” the Brahman mutters thus (Vajasaneyi Samhita II, 12), “This thy sacrifice, O divine Savitri, they have announced . . .,”—thereby he has recourse to Savitri for his impulsion (prasava), for he is the impeller (prasavitri) of the gods;—“to Brihaspati, the Brahman,”—for Brihaspati, assuredly, is the Brahman of the gods: hence he announces that (sacrifice) to him who is the Brahman of the gods; and accordingly he says, “to Brihaspati, the Brahman.”—“Therefore prosper the sacrifice, prosper the lord of sacrifice, prosper me!” In this there is nothing that requires explanation.

(manas) “May his mind delight in the gushing (of the) butter!” By the mind, assuredly, all this (universe) is obtained (or pervaded, aptam): hence he thereby obtains this All by the mind.—“May Brihaspati spread (carry through) this sacrifice! May he restore the sacrifice uninjured!”—he thereby restores what was torn asunder.—“May all the gods rejoice here!”—“all the gods,” doubtless, means the All: hence he thereby restores (the sacrifice) by means of the All. He may add, “Step forward!” if he choose; or, if he choose, he may omit it.

“As long as we are small, there is great destruction for us: fish devours fish.

It soon became a jhasha (a large fish);

for that grows largest (of all fish). Thereupon it said, “In such and such a year that flood will come. Thou shalt then attend to me (i.e. to my advice) by preparing a ship; 

स  औघ उत्थिते  नावमापद्यासै  

and when the flood has risen thou shalt enter into the ship,

After he had reared it in this way, he took it down to the sea. And in the same year which the fish had indicated to him, he attended to (the advice of the fish) by preparing a ship; and when the flood had risen, he entered into the ship. The fish then swam up to him, and to its horn he tied the rope of the ship, and by that means he passed swiftly up to yonder northern mountain.

It then said, “I have saved thee. Fasten the ship to a tree; but let not the water cut thee off, whilst thou art on the mountain. As the water subsides, thou mayest gradually descend!” Accordingly he gradually descended, and hence that (slope) of the northern mountain is called 'Alarm’s descent.' The flood then swept away all these creatures, and Manu alone remained here.

Being desirous of offspring, he engaged in worshipping and austerities. During this time he also performed a paka-sacrifice: he offered up in the waters clarified butter, sour milk, whey, and curds. Thence a woman was produced in a year: becoming quite solid she rose; clarified butter gathered in her footprint. Mitra and Varuna met her.

They said to her, “Who art thou?” 'Manu’s daughter,' she replied. “Say (thou art) ours,” they said. “No,” she said, “I am (the daughter) of him who begat me.” They desired to have a share in her. She either agreed or did not agree, but passed by them. She came to Manu.

Manu said to her, “Who art thou?” 'Thy daughter,' she replied. “How, illustrious one, (art thou) my daughter?” he asked. She replied, “Those offerings (of) clarified butter, sour milk, whey, and curds, which thou madest in the waters, with them thou hast begotten me. I am the blessing (benediction): make use of me at the sacrifice! If thou wilt make use of me at the sacrifice, thou wilt become rich in offspring and cattle. Whatever blessing thou shalt invoke through me, all that shall be granted to thee!” He accordingly made use of her (as the benediction) in the middle of the sacrifice; for what is intermediate between the fore-offerings and the after-offerings, is the middle of the sacrifice.

When he (the Adhvaryu) has cut off the ida piece by piece, and broken off the fore-part of the cake (for the sacrificer’s portion), he puts it (the latter) down (on the barhis) before the dhruva-spoon. Having then handed over the former (the ida) to the Hotri, he passes by him towards the south.

At that time, namely, Manu became apprehensive (thinking), “This (part) of my sacrifice—that is, this ida representing the domestic offering—is certainly the weakest: the Rakshas must not injure my sacrifice at this place.” Accordingly by that (butter, taken from the ida, and smeared on his lips) he promoted it (the ida to a safe place, thinking), “Before the Rakshas (come)! before the Rakshas (come)!” And in like manner this one also thereby promotes (the ida to a safe place, thinking), “Before the Rakshas (come)! before the Rakshas (come)!” And though he does not (at present) eat (the ida) visibly, lest he should eat it before it is invoked, he nevertheless promotes it (to a safe place), when he smears the (butter) on his lips.

He now calls (the ida) in a low voice. At that time, namely, Manu became apprehensive (thinking), “This (part) of my sacrifice—that is, this ida representing the domestic offerings—is certainly the weakest: the Rakshas must not injure my sacrifice at this place.” He accordingly called it to him in a low voice (thinking), “Before the Rakshas (come)! before the Rakshas (come)!” And in like manner this one (the Hotri) thereby calls it (thinking), “Before the Rakshas (come)! before the Rakshas (come)!”

He calls thus (in a low voice), “Hither is called the Rathantara (chant), together with the earth: may the Rathantara, together with the earth, call me! Hither is called the Vamadevya (chant), together with the atmosphere: may the Vamadevya, together with the atmosphere, call me! Hither is called the Brihat (chant), together with the sky: may the Brihat, together with the sky, call me!” In thus calling her (the Ida) to him, he calls to him both these (three) worlds and those chants.

“Manu’s daughter, the butter-pathed (ghritapadi);”—Manu, indeed, begat her of old: for this reason he says, “Manu’s daughter.” 'The butter-pathed' he says, because butter gathered in her footprint: therefore he calls her 'butter-pathed.'

And further, “She who belongs to Mitra and Varuna;”—this 'Maitravaruna nature' (is hers), because she met Mitra and Varuna.—“She, the god-fashioned one, is called hither as the Brahman; for she, the god-fashioned one, is indeed called hither as their Brahman.—”Hither are called the divine Adhvaryus, called hither the human!'—he thereby calls both the divine Adhvaryus and those that are human: the divine Adhvaryus indeed are the calves (vatsah), and what others there are, are the human ones.

Hither are called the primeval, law-abiding, divine (fem.) heaven and earth, whose sons are gods.” He thereby calls to him those two, heaven and earth, within which all this (universe) is embraced.—“Hither is called this sacrificer:” thereby he calls the sacrificer to him. Why he does not mention his name on this occasion, is that this is a mysterious benediction on the ida. Were he, on the contrary, to mention the name, he would do what is human, and the human certainly is inauspicious at the sacrifice: hence he does not mention the name, lest he should do what is inauspicious at the sacrifice.

They (the priests and sacrificer) eat it (the ida), and do not offer it up in the fire; for assuredly the ida means cattle: hence they do not offer it in the fire, lest they should throw the cattle into the fire.

Now when he (the Hotri) intones (in a loud voice), he (the Adhvaryu) divides the (Agni) cake into four parts, and lays it on the barhis (the sacrificial grass covering the altar). Here it lies in place of the fathers; for there are four intermediate quarters, and the intermediate quarters represent the fathers: for this reason he divides the cake into four parts, and lays it on the barhis.

[On the conclusion of the invocation and the eating] they cleanse themselves (with water poured) through the two strainers (pavitra, “purifier”). For they have now performed the ida, which represents the domestic offerings; and thinking, “Purified by the purifiers we will now perform what part of the sacrifice remains still unaccomplished,” they cleanse themselves with the strainers.

He then makes offering to the wives of the gods. In the wives, in the womb, the seed assuredly is planted, and thence it is produced; hence he thereby plants the seed in the wives, in the womb; and thence it is produced: for this reason he makes offering to the wives of the gods.

When he offers to the wives of the gods, he shuts (the fire) out from view on the eastern side; for, up to the time when they offer to the samishtayajus, the deities continue waiting, thinking, “This he must offer up to us!” He thereby conceals (this offering) from them; and accordingly Yajnavalkya says, “Whenever human women here eat (they do so) apart from men.”

He then makes offering to Agni, the householder. Agni, indeed, is this world: hence it is for this world that he thereby produces offspring and that this offspring is produced: this is why he makes offering to Agni, the householder.

When he offers in the evening after sunset, he does so thinking, “I will offer, while he is here, who is this (offering);” and when he offers in the morning before sunrise, he does so thinking, “I will offer, while he is here, who is this (offering):” and for this reason, they say, the Agnihotra is the Sun.

He should not offer it without having put it on the fire; for since this is Agni’s seed, therefore it is hot (shrita, “cooked”); and by putting it on the fire, it is indeed heated: let him, therefore, offer (of the milk) only after he has put it on the fire.

He illumines it (with a burning straw) in order that he may know when it is done. He then pours some water to it (with the sruva), both for the sake of appeasement, and in order to supplement the juice. For when it rains here; then plants spring up; and in consequence of the plants being eaten and the water drunk, this juice is produced: hence it is in order to supplement the juice (that he pours water to it); and therefore, if it should happen to him to have to drink pure milk, let him have one drop of water poured into it, both for the sake of appeasement, and in order to supplement the juice.

Thereupon he ladles four times (milk with the sruva into the Agnihotra ladle), for in a fourfold way was that milk supplied. He then takes a kindling-stick (samidh), and hastes up (to the Ahavaniya, with the ladle) to make the libation on the burning (stick). He offers the first libation (purvahuti) without putting down (the spoon) beside (the fire, on the grass-bunch). For, were he to put it down beside (the fire), it would be as if, in taking food to somebody, one were to put it down on one’s way thither. But when (he makes the libation) without previously putting it down, it is as if, in taking food to somebody, one puts it down only after taking it to him. The second (libation he then makes) after putting it down: he thereby makes these two (libations) of various vigour. Now these two: libations are mind and speech: hence he thereby separates mind and speech from each other; and thus mind and speech, even while one and the same (samana), are still distinct (nana).

[In the evening] he offers (the first libation), with the text (Vajasaneyi Samhita III, 9, 10), “Agni is the light, the light is Agni, Svaha!” and in the morning with, “Surya (the sun) is the light, the light is Surya, Svaha!” Thus offering is made with the truth; for, truly, when the sun goes down, then Agni (fire) is the light, and when the sun rises, then Surya is the light; and whatever is offered with the truth, that, indeed, goes to the gods.

स  वै  दक्षो  नाम  |  

Now he was indeed Daksha: 

तद्यदेनेन  सोऽग्रेऽयजत  तस्माद्दाक्षायणयज्ञो  नामोतैनमेके  

and because he sacrificed in the beginning with this sacrifice, it is called Dakshayana-sacrifice. 

वसिष्ठयज्ञ इत्याचक्षत एष  वै  वसिष्ठ एतमेव  तदन्वाचक्षते  

Some, however, call it the Vasishtha-sacrifice; for he (Prajapati) is indeed vasishtha (the best), and after him they call it. 

स एतेन  यज्ञेनेजे  

He sacrificed with that sacrifice;

स एतेन  यज्ञेनेष्ट्वा  येयम्  प्रजापते  प्रजातिर्या  श्रीरेतद्बभूवैतां  ह  वै  प्रजातिम्  प्रजायत एतां  श्रियं  गचति  

and what race, what prosperity of Prajapati was then produced through his performing that sacrifice, that same race he procreates, that same prosperity he obtains, 

य एवं  विद्वानेतेन  यज्ञेन  यजते  तस्माद्वा एतेन  यजेत
 
whosoever, knowing this, performs that sacrifice: let him therefore perform that sacrifice.

He puts it round him, with the text, “Thou art the covering of consecration and penance;” heretofore, indeed, this was the covering of him as one unconsecrated, but now it is that of consecration and penance: hence he says, “thou art the covering of consecration and penance.” 'I put thee on, the kindly and auspicious;' whereby he means to say, “I put thee on, the kindly and pleasing one;”- 'fostering a fair appearance;' for evil indeed is that appearance which he has heretofore fostered while unconsecrated; but now (he fosters) a fair appearance: therefore he says, “fostering a fair appearance.”

He (the Adhvaryu) then makes him enter the hall.

Let him not eat (the flesh) of either the cow or the ox; for the cow and the ox doubtless support everything here on earth. The gods spake, “Verily, the cow and the ox support everything here: come, let us bestow on the cow and the ox whatever vigour belongs to other species!” 

स यदन्येषां वयसां वीर्यमासीत्तद्धेन्वनडुहयोरदधुस्तस्माद्धेनुश्चैवानड्वांश्च भूयिष्ठम् भुङ्क्तस्तद्धैतत्सर्वाश्यमिव यो धेन्वनडुहयोरश्नीयादन्तगतिरिव 

Accordingly they bestowed on the cow and the ox whatever vigour belonged to other species (of animals); and therefore the cow and the ox eat most. Hence, were one to eat (the flesh) of an ox or a cow, there would be, as it were, an eating of everything, or, as it were, a going on to the end (or, to destruction). 

तं हाद्भुतमभिजनितोर्जायायै गर्भं निरबधीदिति  

Such a one indeed would be likely to be born (again) as a strange being, (as one of whom there is) evil report, such as 'he has expelled an embryo from a woman,' 

पपमकदिति पापी कीर्तिस्तस्माद्धेन्वनडुहयोर्नाश्नीयात्तदु होवाच याज्ञवल्क्यो ऽश्नाम्येवाहमंसलं चेद्भवतीति

'he has committed a sin;'  let him therefore not eat (the flesh) of the cow and the ox. Nevertheless Yajnavalkya said, “I, for one, eat it, provided that it is tender.”

He anoints (the eyes) with a reed-stalk, for the reed is a thunderbolt. It is one with a tuft, in order to chase away the evil spirits. For rootless, indeed, and unfettered on both sides, the Rakshas roams along the air; even as man here roams along the air, rootless and unfettered on both sides: the reason, then, why it is (a reed-stalk) with a tuft, is to chase away the evil spirits.

विष्णोः कर्माणि पश्यत यतो व्रतानि पस्पशे इन्द्रस्य युज्युः सखेति 

“See ye the deeds of Vishnu, whereby he beheld the sacred ordinances, Indra’s allied friend!”

For he who has set up the sacrificial stake has hurled the thunderbolt: “See ye Vishnu’s conquest!” he means to say when he says, “See ye the deeds of Vishnu, whereby he beheld the sacred ordinances, Indra’s allied friend.” Indra, forsooth, is the deity of the sacrifice, 

वैष्णवो यूपस्तं सेन्द्रं करोति 

and the sacrificial stake belongs to Vishnu; he thereby connects it with Indra; 

तस्मादाहेन्द्रस्य युज्यः सखेति

therefore he says, “Indra’s allied friend.”

Thereupon he says (to the Hotri), “Recite to Agni circumambient!” Having taken a firebrand, the Agnidh carries the fire round (the victim). Why he carries the fire round, is that he encircles it (the victim) by means of the fire with an unbroken fence, lest the evil spirits should seize upon it; for Agni is the repeller of the Rakshas; therefore he carries the fire round. He carries it round the place where they cook it (the victim).

As to this they say, “Let him take back that firebrand (to the Ahavaniya); and having there (at the Shamitra) churned out a new fire, let them cook it (the victim) thereon. For this (firebrand), surely, is ahavaniya (fit to offer upon); it is not for the purpose that they should cook uncooked (food) thereon, but for this that they should sacrifice cooked (food) thereon.”

Let him, however, not do this. For in that he carries fire round it, it (the victim) becomes as food swallowed by that (firebrand), and it would be as if he were to seize and tear out food that has been swallowed and offer it to some one else; let them, therefore, crumble some coals off that same firebrand, and thereon cook that (victim).

Thereupon the Agnidh, taking a (new) firebrand, walks in front: whereby he places Agni in front, thinking, “Agni shall repel the evil spirits in front!” and they lead the victim after him (to the slaughtering-place) on a (way) free from danger and injury.

As to this they say, “That (victim) must not be held on to by the sacrificer, for they lead it unto death; therefore let him not hold on to it.” But let him nevertheless hold on to it; for that (victim) which they lead to the sacrifice they lead not to death; therefore let him hold on to it. Moreover he would cut himself off from the sacrifice, were he not to hold on to it; therefore let him hold on to it. It is held on to in a mysterious way; by means of the spits the Pratiprasthatri (holds on to it); to the Pratiprasthatri the Adhvaryu, to the Adhvaryu the Sacrificer; thus then it is held on to in a mysterious way.

Having offered, he bastes first the omentum, then the clotted ghee. Now the Karaka-Adhvaryus, forsooth, baste first the clotted ghee, arguing that the clotted ghee is the breath; and a Caraka-Adhvaryu, forsooth, cursed Yajnavalkya for so doing, saying, “That Adhvaryu has shut out the breath; the breath shall depart from him!”

The Rishi himself answered them,—“In Kurukshetra yonder the gods perform a sacrifice and exclude you two from it: in that respect ye are incomplete, in that respect imperfect!” And the Ashvins departed forthwith, and came to the gods, as they were performing a sacrifice, after the chanting of the Bahishpavamana.

They said, “But surely ye worship with a headless sacrifice!”—“How with a headless (sacrifice)?”—“Nay, invite us, and we will tell you!”—“So be it!” so they invited them. They drew this Ashvina cup for them; and those two became the Adhvaryu priests of the sacrifice, and restored the head of the sacrifice. Then, in the chapter of the divakirtyas, it is explained how they did restore the head of the sacrifice.

For by offering the Rajasuya he becomes king, and by the Vajapeya (he becomes) emperor (samraj); and the office of king is the lower, and that of emperor the higher: a king might indeed wish to become emperor, for the office of king is the lower, and that of emperor the higher; but the emperor would not wish to become king, for the office of king is the lower, and that of emperor the higher.

Now the Brihaspati consecration is the same as the Vajapeya; and the earth in truth is afraid of that (Sacrificer), thinking, “Something great surely has he become now that he has been consecrated: I fear lest he may rend me asunder!” And he himself is afraid of her, thinking, “I fear lest she may shake me off!” Hence he thereby enters into a friendly relation with her, for a mother does not hurt her son; neither does a son hurt his mother.

Now it is to Varuna that those waters belong which, (whilst being part) of flowing water, do not flow: and Varuna’s quickening (sava) is that Rajasuya: therefore he sprinkles him therewith.

He then puts on shoes of boar’s skin. Now the gods once put a pot of ghee on the fire. There from a boar was produced: hence the boar is fat for it was produced from ghee.

Looking down on this (earth) he then mutters, 'O mother Earth, injure me not, nor I thee!’ For the Earth was once afraid of Varuna, when he had been consecrated, thinking, ‘ Something great surely has he become now that he has been consecrated: I fear lest he may rend me asunder! And Varuna also was afraid of the Earth, thinking, I fear lest she may shake me off ! Hence by that (formula) he entered into a friendly relation with her; for a mother does not injure her son, nor does a son injure his mother.

Verily, in the beginning there was here the non-existent. As to this they say, “What was that non-existent?” The Rishis, assuredly,—it is they that were the non-existent. As to this they say, “Who were those Rishis?” The Rishis, doubtless, were the vital airs: inasmuch as before (the existence of) this universe, they, desiring it, wore themselves out (rish) with toil and austerity, therefore (they are called) Rishis.

स यो यम् मध्ये प्राणः एष एवेन्द्रस्तानेष प्राणान्मैन्द्र इत्याचक्षते परो ऽक्षम् परोऽक्षकामा हि देवास्त इद्धाः सप्त नाना पुरुषानसृजन्त

This same vital air in the midst doubtless is Indra. He, by his power (indriya), kindled those (other) vital airs from the midst; and inasmuch as he kindled (indh), he is the kindler (indha): the kindler indeed,—him they call 'Indra' mystically (esoterically), for the gods love the mystic. They (the vital airs), being kindled, created seven separate persons (purusha).

They said, “Surely, being thus, we shall not be able to generate: let us make these seven persons one Person!” They made those seven persons one Person: they compressed two of them (into) what is above the navel, and two of them (into) what is below the navel; (one) person was (one) wing (or side), (one) person was (the other) wing, and one person was the base (i.e. the feet).

And what excellence, what life-sap (rasa) there was in those seven persons, that they concentrated above, that became his head. And because (in it) they concentrated the excellence (shri), therefore it is (called) the head (shiras). It was thereto that the breaths resorted (shri): therefore also it is the head (shiras). And because the breaths did so resort (shri) thereto, therefore also the breaths (vital airs, and their organs) are elements of excellence (shri). And because they resorted to the whole (system) therefore (this is called) body (sharira).

Now this Person Prajapati desired, “May I be more (than one), may I be reproduced!” He toiled, he practised austerity. Being worn out with toil and austerity, he created first of all the Brahman (neut.), the triple science. It became to him a foundation: hence they say, “the Brahman (Veda) is the foundation of everything here.” Wherefore, having studied (the Veda) one rests on a foundation; for this, to wit, the Veda, is his foundation. Resting on that foundation, he (again) practised austerity.

He created the waters out of Vac (speech, that is) the world; for speech belonged to it: that was created (set free). It pervaded everything here; and because it pervaded (ap) whatsoever there was here, therefore (it is called) water (apah); and because it covered (var), therefore also it (is called) water (var).

He desired, “May I be reproduced from these waters!” He entered the waters with that triple science. Thence an egg arose. He touched it. “Let it exist! let it exist and multiply!” so he said. From it the Brahman (neut.) was first created, the triple science. Hence they say, “The Brahman (n.) is the first-born of this All.” For even before that Person the Brahman was created: it was created as his mouth. Hence they say of him who has studied the Veda, that 'he is like Agni;' for it, the Brahman (Veda), is Agni’s mouth.

Now the embryo which was inside was created as the foremost (agri): inasmuch as it was created foremost (agram) of this All, therefore (it is called) Agri: Agri, indeed, is he whom they mystically call Agni; for the gods love the mystic. And the tear (ashru, n.) which had formed itself became the 'ashru' (m.): “ashru” indeed is what they mystically call 'ashva' (horse), for the gods love the mystic. And that which, as it were, cried (ras), became the ass (rasabha). And the juice which was adhering to the shell (of the egg) became the he-goat (aja). And that which was the shell became the earth.

He desired, “May I generate, this (earth) from these waters!” He compressed it and threw it into the water. The juice which flowed from it became a tortoise; and that which was spirted upwards (became) what is produced above here over the wafers. This whole (earth) dissolved itself all over the water: all this (universe) appeared as one form only, namely, water.

And, again, why the Vishnu-strides and the Vatsapra rite are (performed);—by the Vishnu-strides Prajapati created this world, and by the Vatsapra the fire (Agni); by the Vishnu-strides Prajapati created the air, and by the Vatsapra the wind (Vayu); by the Vishnu-strides Prajapati created the sky, and by the Vatsapra the sun (Aditya); by the Vishnu-strides Prajapati created the regions, and by the Vatsapra the moon; by the Vishnu-strides Prajapati created that which has been, and by the Vatsapra that which shall be; by the Vishnu-strides Prajapati created possession (wealth), and by the Vatsapra hope; by the Vishnu-strides Prajapati created the day, and by the Vatsapra the night; by the Vishnu-strides Prajapati created the former (bright) fortnights, and by the Vatsapra the latter (dark) fortnights; by the Vishnu-strides Prajapati created the half-months, and by the Vatsapra the months; by the Vishnu-strides Prajapati created the seasons, and by the Vatsapra the year: thus the reason why the Vishnu-strides and Vatsapra are (performed) is that he thereby even now creates everything.

And, again, why the Vishnu-strides and the Vatsapra rite are (performed). By the Vishnu-strides Prajapati drove up to heaven. He saw that unyoking-place, the Vatsapra, and unyoked thereat to prevent chafing; for when the yoked (beast) is not unloosed, it is chafed. In like manner the Sacrificer drives up to heaven by the Vishnu-strides; and unyokes by means of the Vatsapra.

He then puts down a (living) tortoise;—the tortoise means life-sap: it is life-sap (blood) he thus bestows on (Agni). This tortoise is that life-sap of these worlds which flowed away from them when plunged into the waters: that (life-sap) he now bestows on (Agni). As far as the life-sap extends, so far the body extends: that (tortoise) thus is these worlds.

He anoints it with sour curds, honey, and ghee,—sour curds doubtless are a form of this (earth-)world, ghee of the air, and honey of yonder sky: he thus supplies it (the tortoise) with its own form.

(He anoints it, with Vajasaneyi Samhita XIII, 27-29; Rik S. I, 90, 6-8) “Honey the winds pour forth for the righteous, honey the rivers; full of honey may the plants be for us!—Honey by night and morn, rich in honey may the region of the earth be for us, honey the father Heaven!—rich in honey may the tree be for us, rich in honey the sun, full of honey the kine!” To whatever deity a Rik-verse, and to whatever (deity) a Yajus formula applies, that very deity the verse is, and that very deity the sacrificial formula is. This triplet then is honey (madhu); and honey being life-sap, it is life-sap he thus puts into him (Agni). With three Gayatri verses (he performs): the significance of this has been explained.

And as to its being called 'kurma' (tortoise);Prajapati, having assumed that form, created living beings. Now what he created, he made; and inasmuch as he made (kar), he is (called) “kurma;” and 'kurma' being (the same as) “kashyapa” (a tortoise), therefore all creatures are said to be descended from Kashyapa.

Now this tortoise is the same as yonder sun: it is yonder sun he thus lays down (on the altar). He lays it down in front with the head towards the back (west): he thus places yonder sun in the east looking thitherwards (or moving westward); and hence yonder sun is placed in the east looking thitherwards. On the right (south) of the Ashadha (he places it), for the tortoise (kurma, masc.) is a male, and the Ashadha a female, and the male lies on the right side of the female;—at a cubit’s distance, for at a cubit’s distance the male lies by the female. That Ashadha is the consecrated queen (mahishi) of all the bricks, hence being on the right (south) side of her, it (the tortoise) is on the right side of all the bricks.

And as to why he lays down those Asapatnas. Now at that time, when that (part) of his body had been restored, evil beset Prajapati on every side. He saw those foeless bricks, and laid them down, and by means of them he drove off evil, for foe means evil; and because, by means of them he drove off the foe, evil, therefore they are (called) “foeless” (bricks).

He saw the fifteen parts of the day, the muhurtas, as forms for his body, as space-fillers (Lokamprinas), as well as fifteen of the night; and inasmuch as they straightway (muhu) save (trai), they are (called) “muhurtah”; and inasmuch as, whilst being small, they fill (pur) these worlds (or spaces, “loka”) they are (called) “lokamprinah.”

In this manner he put this threefold lore into his own self, and made it his own; and in this very (performance) he became the body of all existing things, (a body) composed of the metres, stomas, vital airs, and deities; and having become composed of all that, he ascended upwards; and he who thus ascended is that moon yonder.

But, indeed, that Fire-altar also is the Nakshatras:—for there are twenty-seven of these Nakshatras, and twenty-seven secondary stars accompany each Nakshatra,—this makes seven hundred and twenty, and thirty-six in addition thereto. Now what seven hundred and twenty bricks there are of these, they are the three hundred and sixty enclosing-stones and the three hundred and sixty Yajushmati bricks; and what thirty-six there are in addition, they are the thirteenth (intercalary) month, the body (of the altar); the trunk (consisting of) thirty, the feet of two, the (channels of the) vital airs of two, and the head itself being the (thirty-fifth and) thirty-sixth,—and as to there being two of these, it is because 'shiras' (head) consists of two syllables;—and what (space) there is between (each) two Nakshatras that is the Sudadohas; and what food there is in the Nakshatras that is the earth-fillings (between the layers of bricks), the oblations and the fire-logs; and what is called 'nakshatras' that is the space-filling (brick):—thus this comes to make up the whole Agni, and the whole Agni comes to be the space-filler; and, verily, whosoever knows this, thus comes to be that whole (Agni) who is the space-filler.

Let him meditate on the Self, which is made up of intelligence, and endowed with a body of spirit, with a form of light, and with an etherial nature, which changes its shape at will, is swift as thought, of true resolve, and true purpose, which consists of all sweet odours and tastes, which holds sway over all the regions and pervades this whole universe, which is speechless and indifferent;even as a grain of rice, or a grain of barley, or a grain of millet, or the smallest granule of millet, so is this golden Purusha in the heart; even as a smokeless light, it is greater than the sky, greater than the ether, greater than the earth, greater than all existing things;—that self of the spirit (breath) is my self: on passing away from hence I shall obtain that self. Verily, whosoever has this trust, for him there is no uncertainty. Thus spake Sandilya, and so it is.

Verily, in the beginning this (universe) was water, nothing but a sea of water. The waters desired, “How can we be reproduced?” They toiled and performed fervid devotions, when they were becoming heated, a golden egg was produced. The year, indeed, was not then in existence: this golden egg floated about for as long as the space of a year.

In a year’s time a man, this Prajapati, was produced therefrom; and hence a woman, a cow, or a mare brings forth within the space of a year; for Prajapati was born in a year. He broke open this golden egg. There was then, indeed, no resting-place: only this golden egg, bearing him, floated about for as long as the space of a year.

At the end of a year he tried to speak. He said 'bhuh': this (word) became this earth;—“bhuvah”: this became this air;—“svah”: this became yonder sky. Therefore a child tries to speak at the end of a year, for at the end of a year Prajapati tried to speak.

When he was first speaking Prajapati spoke (words) of one syllable and of two syllables; whence a child, when first speaking, speaks (words) of one syllable and of two syllables.

These (three words consist of), five syllables: he made them to be the five seasons, and thus there are these five seasons. At the end of the (first) year, Prajapati rose to stand on these worlds thus produced; whence a child tries to stand up at the end of a year, for at the end of a year Prajapati stood up.
##### 6
स  सहस्रायुर्जज्ञे  स  यथा  नद्यै  पारम्  परापश्येदेवं  स्वस्यायुषः  पारम्  पराचख्यौ

He was born with a life of a thousand years: even as one might see in the distance the opposite shore, so did he behold the opposite shore (the end) of his own life.

Desirous of offspring, he went on singing praises and toiling. He laid the power of reproduction into his own self. By (the breath of) his mouth he created the gods: the gods were created on entering the sky; and this is the godhead of the gods (deva) that they were created on entering the sky (div). Having created them, there was, as it were, daylight for him; and this also is the godhead of the gods that, after creating them, there was, as it were, daylight (diva) for him.
##### 8

And by the downward breathing he created the Asuras: they were created on entering this earth. Having created them there was, as it were, darkness for him.

He knew, “Verily, I have created evil for myself since, after creating, there has come to be, as it were, darkness for me.” Even then he smote them with evil, and owing to this it was that they were overcome; whence people say, “Not true is that regarding (the fight between) the gods and Asuras which is related partly in the tale and partly in the legend; for it was even then that Prajapati smote them with evil, and it was owing to this that they were overcome.”

Therefore it is with reference to this that the Rishi has said, “Not for a single day hast thou fought, nor hast thou any enemy, O Maghavan illusion is what they say concerning thy battles; no foe hast thou fought either to-day or aforetime.”

Now what daylight, as it were, there was for him, on creating the gods, of that he made the day; and what darkness, as it were, there was for him, on creating the Asuras, of that he made the night: they are these two, day and night.

Prajapati bethought himself, “Everything (sarva), indeed, I have obtained by stealth (tsar) who have created these deities:” this became the 'sarvatsara,' for 'sarvatsara,' doubtless, is the same as 'samvatsara (year).' And, verily, whosoever thus knows 'samvatsara' to be the same as 'sarvatsara,' is not overcome by any evil which, by magic art, steals upon him (tsar); and whosoever thus knows 'samvatsara' to be the same as 'sarvatsara,' overcomes against whomsoever he practises magic art.

Prajapati bethought himself, “Verily, I have created here a counterpart of myself, to wit, the year;” whence they say, “Prajapati is the year;” for he created it to be a counterpart of himself: inasmuch as 'samvatsara (year),' as well as 'Prajapati,' consists of four syllables, thereby it (the year) is a counterpart of him.
##### 14
ता वा एताः प्रजापतेरधि देवता असृज्यन्ताग्निरिन्द्रः सोमः परमेष्ठी प्राजापत्यः

Now, these are the deities who were created out of Prajapati,—Agni, Indra, Soma, and Parameshthin Prajapatya.

They went on singing praises and toiling. Then Parameshthin, son of Prajapati, saw that sacrifice, the New and Full-moon offerings, and performed these offerings. Having performed them, he desired, “Would I were everything here!” He became the waters, for the waters are everything here, inasmuch as they abide in the furthest place; for he who digs here on earth finds indeed water; and, in truth, it is from that furthest place, to wit, from yonder sky that he rains, whence the name Parameshthin (abiding in the furthest, highest place).

Parameshthin spake unto his father Prajapati, “I have discovered a sacrifice which fulfils wishes: let me perform this for thee!”—“So be it!” he said. He accordingly performed it for him. Having sacrificed, he (Prajapati) desired, “Would I were everything here!” He became the breath (vital air), for breath is everything here: Prajapati is that breath which blows here (the wind); and whatsoever knows that it is thus he blows is his (Prajapati's) eyesight; and whatsoever is endowed with breath is Prajapati. And, verily, whosoever thus knows that eyesight of Prajapati becomes, as it were, manifest,

Prajapati spake unto his son Indra, “Let me perform for thee this wish-fulfilling sacrifice which Parameshthin has just performed for me.”—“So be it!” he said. He accordingly performed it for him. Having sacrificed, he (Indra) desired, “Would that I were everything here!” He became speech (vac), for speech is everything here; whence they say, “Indra is Vac.”

Indra spake unto his brothers Agni and Soma, “Let me perform for you this wish-fulfilling sacrifice which our father Prajapati has just performed for me.”—“So be it!” they said. He accordingly performed it for them. Having sacrificed, those two desired, “Would that we were everything here!” One of them became the eater of food, and the other became food: Agni became the eater of food, and Soma food; and the eater of food, and food, indeed, are everything here.
##### 29
अथाध्यात्मम् पञ्चेमे पुरुषे प्राणा ऋते चक्षुर्भ्यां त एव पञ्च प्रयाजा चक्षुषी आज्यभागौ

Now as to the body:—there are in man these five breathings, not including the eyes; they are the five fore-offerings, and the two butter-portions are the eyes.

He then recognised her and implored her ([[RV#10.95#1]]X, 95, I), “Oh, my wife, stay thou, cruel in mind: let us now exchange words! Untold, these secrets of ours will not bring us joy in days to come;”—“Stop, pray, let us speak together!” this is what he meant to say to her.

They said, “Cook for a whole year a mess of rice sufficient for four persons; and taking each time three logs from this Ashvattha tree, anoint them with ghee, and put them on the fire with verses containing the words "log" and "ghee": the fire which shall result therefrom will be that very fire (which is required).”

अथ ब्रह्मयज्ञः 

Then as to the sacrifice to the Brahman. 

स्वाध्यायो वै ब्रह्मयज्ञस्तस्य वा 

The sacrifice to the Brahman is one’s own (daily) study (of the Veda). 

एतस्य ब्रह्मयज्ञस्य वागेव जुहूर्मन उपभृच्चक्षुर्ध्रुवा मेधा स्रुवः सत्यमवभृथः स्वर्गो लोक उदयनं 

The juhu-spoon of this same sacrifice to the Brahman is speech, its upabhrit the mind, its dhruva the eye, its sruva mental power, its purificatory bath truth, its conclusion heaven. 

यावन्तं ह वा इमाम् पृथिवीं वित्तेन पूर्णां ददंलोकं जयति 

And, verily, however great the world he gains by giving away (to the priests) this earth replete with wealth, 

त्रिस्तावन्तं जयति भूयांसं चाक्षय्यं 

thrice that and more—an imperishable world does he gain, 

य एवं विद्वानहरहः स्वाध्यायमधीते

He performs the animal sacrifice. Now the animal sacrifice means cattle: thus, when he performs the animal sacrifice (pashubandha, the binding of the animal), it is in order that he may be possessed of cattle. Let him perform it at his home, thinking, “I will bind (attach) cattle to my home.” 

तेन  सुयवसे  यजेत  सुयवसे  पशूंबद्ंना इति  जीर्यंति  ह  वै  

Let him perform it in the season of abundant fodder, thinking, “I will bind to myself cattle in a season of abundant fodder.” 

जुह्वतो  यजमानस्याग्नयोऽग्नींजीर्यतोऽनु  यजमानो  यजमानमनु  गृहाश्च  पशवश्च

For, whilst he is offering, the Sacrificer’s fires become worn out, and so does the Sacrificer, along with the worn-out fires, and along with the Sacrificer his house and cattle.

And when he performs the animal sacrifice, he renews his fires, and so, along with the renewal of his fires, does the Sacrificer (renew himself), and along with the Sacrificer his house and cattle. And beneficial to life, indeed, is that redemption of his own self 1; for whilst he is offering the Sacrificer's fires long for flesh; they set their minds on the Sacrificer and harbour designs on him. In other fires 2 people do indeed cook any kind of meat, but these (sacrificial fires) have no desire for any other flesh but this (sacrificial animal), and for him to whom they belong.

Now, when he performs the animal offering. he thereby redeems himself--male by male, for the victim is a male, and the Sacrificer is a male. And this, indeed, to wit, flesh, is the best kind of food: he thus becomes an eater of the best kind of food. Let not a year pass by for him without his offering; for the year means life: it is thus immortal life he thereby confers upon himself.

Now there is one animal sacrifice of the Haviryajna order, and another of the order of the Soma-sacrifice. Of the Haviryajna order is that at which he (the Adhvaryu) brings him fast-food, leads water forward, and pours out a jarful of water, and at which (the Sacrificer) strides the Vishnu-strides; and of the order of the Soma-sacrifice is that (animal sacrifice) at which these (rites) are not performed.

And on the eighth day, after those (three) offerings have been performed in the same way, there is the same course of procedure. “Adhvaryu!” he (the Hotri) says.—“Havai hotar!” replies the Adhvaryu.—“King Matsya Sammada,” he says; 'his people are the water-dwellers, and they are staying here;'—both fish and fishermen have come thither: it is these he instructs;—“the Itihasa 3 is the Veda: this it is;” thus saying, let him tell some Itihasa. The Adhvaryu calls in the same way (on the masters of lute-players), but does not perform the Prakrama oblations.

एतेउक्त्वा यदध्रिगोः परिशिष्टम् भवति तदाह वासोऽधिवासं हिरण्यमित्यश्वायोपस्तृणन्ति तस्मिन्नेनमधि सञ्ज्ञपयन्ति सञ्ज्ञप्तेषु पशुषु पत्न्यः पान्नेजनैरुदायन्ति चतस्रश्च जायाः कुमारी पञ्चमी चत्वारि च शतान्यनुचरीणाम्

Having uttered these two (verses), he pronounces what remains of the Adhrigu. “A cloth, an upper cloth, and gold,” this is what they spread out for the horse: thereon they 'quiet' (slaughter) it. When the victims have been 'quieted,' the (king's) wives come up with water for washing the feet,—four wives; and a young maiden as the fifth, and four hundred female attendants.

When the foot-water is ready, they cause the Mahishi to lie down near the horse, and cover her up with the upper cloth, with 'In heaven ye envelop yourselves,'—for that indeed is heaven where they immolate the victim, . . ., “May the vigorous male, the layer of seed, lay seed!” she says for the completeness of union.

तयोः शयानयोः अश्वं यजमानोऽभिमेथत्युत्सक्थ्या अव गुदं धेहीति तं न कश्चन प्रत्यभिमेथति नेद्यजमानम् प्रतिप्रतिः कश्चिदसदिति

Whilst they are lying there, the Sacrificer addresses the horse (Vajasaneyi Samhita XXIII, 21), “Utsakhya ava gudam dhehi!” No one replies to him, lest there should be some one to rival the Sacrificer.

The Adhvaryu then addresses the maiden, “Hey hey maiden, that little bird . . .”—The maiden replies to him, “Adhvaryu! that little bird . . .”

And the Brahman addresses the Mahishi, “Mahishi, hey hey Mahishi, thy mother and father mount to the top of the tree . . .”—She has a hundred daughters of kings attending upon her: these reply to the Brahman, “Brahman, hey hey Brahman, thy mother and father play on the top of the tree. . .”

Now, Indrota Daivapa Shaunaka once performed this sacrifice for Janamejaya Parikshita, and by performing it he extinguished all evil-doing, all Brahman-slaughter; and, verily, he who performs the Ashvamedha extinguishes (the guilt incurred by) all evil-doing, all Brahman-slaughter.

The Agnishtoma in the Trivrit (stoma); the Ukthya in the Pancadasha; and the third day, with the Uktha (stotras), in the Saptadasha; the Shodashin (stotra) in the Ekavimsha, the night (stotras) in the Pancadasha, and the Sandhi (stotra) in the Trivrit,—this is the (sacrifice) resulting in the Anushtubh: it is therewith that sacrifice was performed by Dhvasan Dvaitavana, the king of the Matsyas, where there is the lake Dvaitavana; and it is of this that the Gatha sings,—“Fourteen steeds did king Dvaitavana, victorious in battle, bind for Indra Vritrahan, whence the lake Dvaitavana (took its name).

Suchlike is Vishnu’s striding,—it was therewith that Bharata Dauhshanti once performed sacrifice, and attained that wide sway which now belongs to the Bharatas: it is of this that the Gatha sings,—“Seventy-eight steeds did Bharata Dauhshanti bind for the Vritra-slayer on the Yamuna, and fifty-five near the Gaṅga.”

Purusha Narayana desired, “Would that I overpassed all beings! would that I alone were everything here (this universe)!” He beheld this five-days’ sacrificial performance, the Purushamedha, and took it, and performed offering therewith; and having performed offering therewith, he overpassed all beings, and became everything here. And, verily, he who, knowing this, performs the Purushamedha, or who even knows this, overpasses all beings, and becomes everything here.

And, again, as to why there are (the victims) of the set of eleven (stakes): it is for the sake of his obtaining and securing everything, for the set of eleven (stakes) is everything, since the set of eleven (stakes) is Prajapati, and Prajapati is everything, and the Purushamedha is everything.

ओम्  देवा  ह  वै  सत्त्रं  निषेदुः  अग्निरिन्द्रः  सोमो  मखो  विष्णुर्विश्वे  देवा  अन्यत्रैवाश्विभ्याम्

The gods Agni, Indra, Soma, Makha, Vishnu, and the Vishve Devah,  (niṣad) performed a sacrificial (sattra) session, (anyatra) except for the two Ashvins.

Their place of divine worship was Kurukshetra.. Therefore people say that Kurukshetra is the gods’ place of divine worship: hence wherever in Kurukshetra one settles there one thinks, “This is a place for divine worship;” for it was the gods’ place of divine worship.
##### 5
तद्विष्णुः  प्रथमः  प्राप  स  देवानां  श्रेष्ठोऽभवत्तस्मादाहुर्विष्णुर्देवानां  श्रेष्ठ इति

Vishnu first attained it, and he became the most excellent of the gods; whence people say, “Vishnu is the most excellent of the gods.”

Now he who is this Vishnu is the sacrifice; and he who is this sacrifice is yonder Aditya (the sun). But, indeed, Vishnu was unable to control that (love of) glory of his; and so even now not every one can control that (love of) glory of his.
##### 7
स  तिसृधन्वमादायापचक्राम  स  धनुरार्त्न्या  शिर उपस्तभ्य  तस्थौ  तम्  देवा  अनभिधृष्णुवन्तः  समन्तम्  परिण्यविशन्त

Taking his bow, together with three arrows, he stepped forth. He stood, resting his head on the end of the bow. Not daring to attack him, the gods sat themselves down all around him.

Then the ants said—these ants (vamri), doubtless, were that (kind called) “upadika”—“What would ye give to him who should gnaw the bowstring?”—“We would give him the (constant) enjoyment of food, and he would find water even in the desert: so we would give him every enjoyment of food.”—“So be it,” they said.
##### 9
तस्योपपरासृत्य  ज्यामपिजक्षुस्तस्यां  चिन्नायां  धनुरार्त्न्यौ  विष्फुरन्त्यौ  विष्णो  शिरः  प्रचिचिदतुः

Having gone nigh unto him, they gnawed his bowstring. When it was cut, the ends of the bow, springing asunder, cut off Vishnu’s head.

It fell with (the sound) “ghriṅ”; and on falling it became yonder sun. And the rest (of the body) lay stretched out (with the top part) towards the east. And inasmuch as it fell with (the sound) “ghriṅ,” therefrom the Gharma (was called); and inasmuch as he was stretched out (pra-vrij,), therefrom the Pravargya (took its name).
##### 11

The gods spake, “Verily, our great hero (mahan virah) has fallen:” therefrom the Mahavira pot (was named). And the vital sap which flowed from him they wiped up (sam-mrij) with their hands, whence the Samraj.
##### 12
तम्  देवा  अभ्यमृज्यन्त  यथा  वित्तिम्  वेत्स्यमाना एवम्  तमिन्द्रः  प्रथमः  प्राप  तमन्वङ्गमनुन्यपद्यत  तम्  पर्यगृह्णात्तम्  परिगृह्येदं  यशोऽभवद्यदिदमिन्द्रो  यशो  यशो  ह  भवति  य एवम्  वेद

The gods rushed forward to him, even as those eager to secure some gain (will do). Indra reached him first. He applied himself to him limb after limb, and encompassed him, and, in encompassing him, he became (possessed of) that glory of his. And, verily, he who knows this becomes (possessed of) that glory which Indra is (possessed of).
##### 13
स उ एव  मखः  स  विष्णुः  तत इन्द्रो  मखवानभवन्मखवान्ह  वै  तम्  मघवानित्याचक्षते  परोऽक्षम्  परोऽक्षकामा  हि  देवाः

And Makha (sacrifice), indeed, is the same as Vishnu: hence Indra became Makhavat (possessed of makha), ([[RV#1.3]]) since Makhavat is he who is mystically called Maghavat, for the gods love the mystic.
##### 15
अथेमम्  विष्णुं  यज्ञम्  त्रेधा  व्यभजन्त  वसवः  प्रातःसवनं  रुद्रा  माध्यन्दिनं  सवनमादित्यास्तृतीयसवनम्

This Vishnu, the (Soma-) sacrifice, they then divided amongst themselves into three parts: the Vasus (received) the morning-pressing, the Rudras the midday-pressing, and the Adityas the third pressing.
##### 16
अग्निः  प्रातःसवनम् इन्द्रो  माध्यन्दिनं  सवनम्  विश्वे  देवास्तृतीयसवनम्

Agni (received) the morning-pressing, Indra the middle portion, and the remaining Visvedevas the third portion.
##### 18

Now Dadhyanc Atharvana knew this pure essence, this Sacrifice,—how this head of the Sacrifice is put on again, how this Sacrifice becomes complete.
##### 19
स  हेन्द्रेणोक्त आस एतम्  चेदन्यस्मा  अनुब्रूयास्तत एव  ते  शिरश्चिन्द्यामित्i

He then was spoken to by Indra saying, “If thou teachest this (sacrificial mystery) to any one else, I shall cut off thy head.”
##### 20
तदु  हाश्विनोरनुश्रुतमास  दध्यङ्ङु  ह  वा आथर्वण एतं  शुक्रमेतं  यज्ञम्  वेद  यथायथैतद्यज्ञस्य  शिरः  प्रतिधीयते  यथैष  कृत्स्नो  यज्ञो  भवति

Now this was heard by the Ashvins,—“Verily, Dadhyanc Atharvana knows this pure essence, this Sacrifice,—how this head of the Sacrifice is put on again, how this Sacrifice becomes complete.”

He then received them (as his pupils); and when he had received them, they cut off his head, and put it aside elsewhere; and having fetched the head of a horse, they put it on him: therewith he taught them; and when he had taught them, Indra cut off that head of his; and having fetched his own head, they put it on him again,

Therefore it is concerning this that the Rishi has said ([[RV#1.116#12]]), “That Dadhyanc Atharvana, with a horse’s head, anywise spoke forth unto you two the sweet doctrine:”—“Unrestrainedly he spoke this,” is what is thereby meant.

He then takes the lump of clay with the (right) hand and spade on the right (south) side, and with the (left) hand alone on the left (north) side, with (Vajasaneyi Samhita XXXVII, 3), “O divine Heaven and Earth,”—for when the sacrifice had its head cut off, its sap flowed away, and entered the sky and the earth: what clay (firm matter) there was that is this (earth), and what water there was that is yonder (sky); hence it is of clay and water that the Mahavira (vessels) are made: he thus supplies and completes it (the Pravargya) with that sap; wherefore he says, “O divine Heaven and Earth,”—“May I this day compass for you Makha’s head,”—Makha being the sacrifice, he thus says, “May I this day accomplish for you the head of the sacrifice;”—“on the Earth’s place of divine worship,”—for on a place of divine worship of the earth he prepares it;—“for Makha thee! for Makha’s head thee!”—Makha being the sacrifice, he thus says, “For the sacrifice (I consecrate) thee, for the head of the sacrifice (I consecrate) thee.”

Then (earth) torn up by a boar (he takes), with (Vajasaneyi Samhita XXXVII, 5), “Only thus large was she in the beginning,”—for, indeed, only so large was this earth in the beginning, of the size of a span. A boar, called Emusha, raised her up, and he was her lord Prajapati: with that mate, his heart’s delight, he thus supplies and completes him;—“may I this day compass for you Makha’s head on the Earth’s place of divine worship: for Makha thee! for Makha’s head thee!” the import of this is the same as before.

And as to why he places it north (of Soma’s seat),—Soma is the sacrifice, and the Pravargya is its head; but the head is higher (uttara): therefore he places it north (uttara) of it. Moreover, Soma is king, and the Pravargya is emperor, and the imperial dignity is higher than the royal: therefore he places it north of it.
