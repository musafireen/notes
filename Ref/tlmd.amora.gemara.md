In another baraita it was taught that Abba Binyamin says: If the eye was given permission to see, no creature would be able to withstand the abundance and ubiquity of the demons and continue to live unaffected by them.

תָּנוּ רַבָּנַן: שְׁתֵּי שָׁנִים וּמֶחֱצָה נֶחְלְקוּ בֵּית שַׁמַּאי וּבֵית הִלֵּל. 

The Sages taught the following baraita: For two and a half years, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disagreed. 

הַלָּלוּ אוֹמְרִים: נוֹחַ לוֹ לְאָדָם שֶׁלֹּא נִבְרָא יוֹתֵר מִשֶּׁנִּבְרָא, 

These say: It would have been preferable had man not been created than to have been created. 

וְהַלָּלוּ אוֹמְרִים: נוֹחַ לוֹ לְאָדָם שֶׁנִּבְרָא יוֹתֵר מִשֶּׁלֹּא נִבְרָא. 

And those said: It is preferable for man to have been created than had he not been created. 

נִמְנוּ וְגָמְרוּ: נוֹחַ לוֹ לְאָדָם שֶׁלֹּא נִבְרָא יוֹתֵר מִשֶּׁנִּבְרָא, 

Ultimately, they were counted and concluded: It would have been preferable had man not been created than to have been created. 

עַכְשָׁיו שֶׁנִּבְרָא — יְפַשְׁפֵּשׁ בְּמַעֲשָׂיו. 

However, now that he has been created, he should examine his actions that he has performed and seek to correct them. 

וְאָמְרִי לַהּ: יְמַשְׁמֵשׁ בְּמַעֲשָׂיו.

And some say: He should scrutinize his planned actions and evaluate whether or not and in what manner those actions should be performed, so that he will not sin.

וְיֵשׁ אוֹמְרִים: ״וֶאֱמֶת ה׳ לְעוֹלָם״ גַּבְרִיאֵל אֲמָרוֹ. 

And some say that the angel Gabriel recited: 

“And the truth of the Lord endures forever.” 

This Gemara elaborates: 

בְּשָׁעָה שֶׁהִפִּיל נִמְרוֹד הָרָשָׁע אֶת אַבְרָהָם אָבִינוּ לְתוֹךְ כִּבְשַׁן הָאֵשׁ אָמַר גַּבְרִיאֵל לִפְנֵי הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא: 

When the evil Nimrod threw our father, Abraham, into the fiery furnace, Gabriel said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: 

רִבּוֹנוֹ שֶׁל עוֹלָם, אֵרֵד וַאֲצַנֵּן וְאַצִּיל אֶת הַצַּדִּיק מִכִּבְשַׁן הָאֵשׁ. 

Master of the Universe, I will descend and cool the furnace, and I will thereby save the righteous Abraham from the fiery furnace. 

אָמַר לוֹ הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא: אֲנִי יָחִיד בְּעוֹלָמִי וְהוּא יָחִיד בְּעוֹלָמוֹ, נָאֶה לַיָּחִיד לְהַצִּיל אֶת הַיָּחִיד. 

The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to him: I am unique in my world and Abraham is still unique in his world. It is fitting for the unique to save the unique. 

וּלְפִי שֶׁהַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא אֵינוֹ מְקַפֵּחַ שְׂכַר כׇּל בְּרִיָּה, 

Therefore, God Himself went down and saved him. And as the Holy One, Blessed be He, does not withhold reward from any creature who sought to perform a good deed, 

אָמַר: תִּזְכֶּה וְתַצִּיל שְׁלֹשָׁה מִבְּנֵי בָנָיו.

He said to Gabriel: You will merit the rescue of three of his descendants under similar circumstances.

דָּרַשׁ רַבִּי שִׁמְעוֹן הַשִּׁלוֹנִי: 

Rabbi Shimon HaShiloni taught: 

בְּשָׁעָה שֶׁהִפִּיל נְבוּכַדְנֶצַּר הָרָשָׁע חֲנַנְיָה מִישָׁאֵל וַעֲזַרְיָה לְתוֹךְ כִּבְשַׁן הָאֵשׁ, עָמַד יוֹרֶקְמוֹ שַׂר הַבָּרָד לִפְנֵי הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא, אָמַר לְפָנָיו: 

When the evil Nebuchadnezzar threw Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah into the fiery furnace, Yurkamo, the ministering angel of hail, stood before the Holy One, Blessed be He, and said before Him: 

רִבּוֹנוֹ שֶׁל עוֹלָם, אֵרֵד וַאֲצַנֵּן אֶת הַכִּבְשָׁן וְאַצִּיל לַצַּדִּיקִים הַלָּלוּ מִכִּבְשַׁן הָאֵשׁ. 

Master of the Universe, I will go down and cool the fiery furnace, and I will save these righteous ones from the fiery furnace. 

אָמַר לוֹ גַּבְרִיאֵל: אֵין גְּבוּרָתוֹ שֶׁל הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא בְּכָךְ שֶׁאַתָּה שַׂר בָּרָד, וְהַכֹּל יוֹדְעִין שֶׁהַמַּיִם מְכַבִּין אֶת הָאֵשׁ. 

Gabriel said to him: The strength of the Holy One, Blessed be He, will not be evident in this manner, as you are the minister of hail, and everyone knows that water extinguishes fire. 

אֶלָּא, אֲנִי שַׂר שֶׁל אֵשׁ אֵרֵד וַאֲקָרֵר מִבִּפְנִים,

Your action would not be regarded as a great miracle. Rather, I, the ministering angel of fire, will descend, and I will cool the furnace from within,

מַעֲשֶׂה שֶׁשָּׁלְחוּ לְחוֹנִי הַמְעַגֵּל וְכוּ׳. 

The mishna taught: **An incident** occurred in **which** the people **sent** a message **to Ḥoni HaMe’aggel.** 

This event is related in greater detail in the following _baraita_. 

תָּנוּ רַבָּנַן: פַּעַם אַחַת יָצָא רוֹב אֲדָר וְלֹא יָרְדוּ גְּשָׁמִים, 

**The Sages taught: Once, most of** the month of **Adar had passed but rain had** still **not fallen. 

שָׁלְחוּ לְחוֹנִי הַמְעַגֵּל: הִתְפַּלֵּל וְיֵרְדוּ גְּשָׁמִים! הִתְפַּלֵּל, וְלֹא יָרְדוּ גְּשָׁמִים. עָג עוּגָה וְעָמַד בְּתוֹכָהּ, 

They sent** this message **to Ḥoni HaMe’aggel: Pray, and rain will fall. He prayed, but no rain fell. 

כְּדֶרֶךְ שֶׁעָשָׂה חֲבַקּוּק הַנָּבִיא, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: 

He drew a circle** in the dust **and stood inside it, in the manner that the prophet Habakkuk did, as it is stated: 

״עַל מִשְׁמַרְתִּי אֶעֱמֹדָה וְאֶתְיַצְּבָה עַל מָצוֹר וְגוֹ׳״.

“And I will stand upon my watch and set myself upon the tower,** and I will look out to see what He will say to me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved” (Habakkuk 2:1). 

This verse is taken to mean that Habakkuk fashioned a kind of prison for himself where he sat.

The Gemara returns to the topic of the Design of the Divine Chariot. 

תָּנוּ רַבָּנַן: מַעֲשֶׂה בְּרַבָּן יוֹחָנָן בֶּן זַכַּאי שֶׁהָיָה רוֹכֵב עַל הַחֲמוֹר, וְהָיָה מְהַלֵּךְ בַּדֶּרֶךְ, וְרַבִּי אֶלְעָזָר בֶּן עֲרָךְ מְחַמֵּר אַחֲרָיו. 

The Sages taught: An incident occurred involving Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai, who was riding on a donkey and was traveling along the way, and his student, Rabbi Elazar ben Arakh, was riding a donkey behind him. 

אָמַר לוֹ: רַבִּי, שְׁנֵה לִי פֶּרֶק אֶחָד בְּמַעֲשֵׂה מֶרְכָּבָה. 

Rabbi Elazar said to him: My teacher, teach me one chapter in the Design of the Divine Chariot. 

אָמַר לוֹ, לֹא כָּךְ שָׁנִיתִי לָכֶם: וְלֹא בַּמֶּרְכָּבָה בְּיָחִיד אֶלָּא אִם כֵּן הָיָה חָכָם מֵבִין מִדַּעְתּוֹ? 

He said to him: Have I not taught you: And one may not expound the Design of the Divine Chariot to an individual, unless he is a Sage who understands on his own accord? 

אָמַר לוֹ: רַבִּי, תַּרְשֵׁינִי לוֹמַר לְפָנֶיךָ דָּבָר אֶחָד שֶׁלִּמַּדְתַּנִי. אָמַר לוֹ: אֱמוֹר.

Rabbi Elazar said to him: My teacher, allow me to say before you one thing that you taught me. 

In other words, he humbly requested to recite before him his own understanding of this issue. He said to him: Speak.
##### 3
מִיָּד יָרַד רַבָּן יוֹחָנָן בֶּן זַכַּאי מֵעַל הַחֲמוֹר, וְנִתְעַטֵּף, וְיָשַׁב עַל הָאֶבֶן תַּחַת הַזַּיִת. 

Immediately, Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai alighted from the donkey, and wrapped his head in his cloak in a manner of reverence, and sat on a stone under an olive tree. 

אָמַר לוֹ: רַבִּי, מִפְּנֵי מָה יָרַדְתָּ מֵעַל הַחֲמוֹר? 

Rabbi Elazar said to him: My teacher, for what reason did you alight from the donkey? 

אָמַר: אֶפְשָׁר אַתָּה דּוֹרֵשׁ בְּמַעֲשֵׂה מֶרְכָּבָה, וּשְׁכִינָה עִמָּנוּ, וּמַלְאֲכֵי הַשָּׁרֵת מְלַוִּין אוֹתָנוּ, וַאֲנִי אֶרְכַּב עַל הַחֲמוֹר?! 

He said: Is it possible that while you are expounding the Design of the Divine Chariot, and the Divine Presence is with us, and the ministering angels are accompanying us, that I should ride on a donkey? 

מִיָּד פָּתַח רַבִּי אֶלְעָזָר בֶּן עֲרָךְ בְּמַעֲשֵׂה הַמֶּרְכָּבָה וְדָרַשׁ. וְיָרְדָה אֵשׁ מִן הַשָּׁמַיִם, וְסִיבְּבָה כׇּל הָאִילָנוֹת שֶׁבַּשָּׂדֶה, פָּתְחוּ כּוּלָּן וְאָמְרוּ שִׁירָה.

Immediately, Rabbi Elazar ben Arakh began to discuss the Design of the Divine Chariot and expounded, and fire descended from heaven and encircled all the trees in the field, and all the trees began reciting song.
##### 4
מָה שִׁירָה אָמְרוּ — 

What song did they recite? 

״הַלְלוּ אֶת ה׳ מִן הָאָרֶץ תַּנִּינִים וְכׇל תְּהוֹמוֹת ... עֵץ פְּרִי וְכׇל אֲרָזִים ... הַלְלוּיָהּ״. 

“Praise the Lord from the earth, sea monsters and all depths…fruit trees and all cedars…praise the Lord” (Psalms 148:7–14). 

נַעֲנָה מַלְאָךְ מִן הָאֵשׁ, וְאָמַר: הֵן הֵן מַעֲשֵׂה הַמֶּרְכָּבָה. 

An angel responded from the fire, saying: This is the very Design of the Divine Chariot, just as you expounded. 

עָמַד רַבָּן יוֹחָנָן בֶּן זַכַּאי וּנְשָׁקוֹ עַל רֹאשׁוֹ, וְאָמַר: בָּרוּךְ ה׳ אֱלֹהֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל שֶׁנָּתַן בֵּן לְאַבְרָהָם אָבִינוּ שֶׁיּוֹדֵעַ לְהָבִין וְלַחְקוֹר וְלִדְרוֹשׁ בְּמַעֲשֵׂה מֶרְכָּבָה. 

Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai stood and kissed Rabbi Elazar ben Arakh on his head, and said: Blessed be God, Lord of Israel, who gave our father Abraham a son like you, who knows how to understand, investigate, and expound the Design of the Divine Chariot. 

יֵשׁ נָאֶה דּוֹרֵשׁ וְאֵין נָאֶה מְקַיֵּים, נָאֶה מְקַיֵּים וְאֵין נָאֶה דּוֹרֵשׁ. אַתָּה נָאֶה דּוֹרֵשׁ וְנָאֶה מְקַיֵּים. 

There are some who expound the Torah’s verses well but do not fulfill its imperatives well, and there are some who fulfill its imperatives well but do not expound its verses well, whereas you expound its verses well and fulfill its imperatives well. 

אַשְׁרֶיךָ אַבְרָהָם אָבִינוּ, שֶׁאֶלְעָזָר בֶּן עֲרָךְ יָצָא מֵחֲלָצֶיךָ.

Happy are you, our father Abraham, that Elazar ben Arakh came from your loins.

The Gemara relates: 

וּכְשֶׁנֶּאֶמְרוּ הַדְּבָרִים לִפְנֵי רַבִּי יְהוֹשֻׁעַ, הָיָה הוּא וְרַבִּי יוֹסֵי הַכֹּהֵן מְהַלְּכִים בַּדֶּרֶךְ. 

And when these matters, this story involving his colleague Rabbi Elazar ben Arakh, were recounted before Rabbi Yehoshua, he was walking along the way with Rabbi Yosei the Priest. 

אָמְרוּ: אַף אָנוּ נִדְרוֹשׁ בְּמַעֲשֵׂה מֶרְכָּבָה. 

They said: We too shall expound the Design of the Divine Chariot. Rabbi Yehoshua began expounding. 

פָּתַח רַבִּי יְהוֹשֻׁעַ וְדָרַשׁ. 

Rabbi Yehoshua began expounding. 

וְאוֹתוֹ הַיּוֹם תְּקוּפַת תַּמּוּז הָיָה. 

And that was the day of the summer solstice, when there are no clouds in the sky. 

נִתְקַשְּׁרוּ שָׁמַיִם בְּעָבִים וְנִרְאֶה כְּמִין קֶשֶׁת בֶּעָנָן, וְהָיוּ מַלְאֲכֵי הַשָּׁרֵת מִתְקַבְּצִין וּבָאִין לִשְׁמוֹעַ, כִּבְנֵי אָדָם שֶׁמִּתְקַבְּצִין וּבָאִין לִרְאוֹת בְּמַזְמוּטֵי חָתָן וְכַלָּה.

Yet the heavens became filled with clouds, and there was the appearance of a kind of rainbow in a cloud. And ministering angels gathered and came to listen, like people gathering and coming to see the rejoicing of a bridegroom and bride.
##### 6
הָלָךְ רַבִּי יוֹסֵי הַכֹּהֵן וְסִיפֵּר דְּבָרִים לִפְנֵי רַבָּן יוֹחָנָן בֶּן זַכַּאי, 

Rabbi Yosei the Priest went and recited these matters before Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai, 

וְאָמַר: אַשְׁרֵיכֶם וְאַשְׁרֵי יוֹלַדְתְּכֶם, אַשְׁרֵי עֵינַי שֶׁכָּךְ רָאוּ. 

who said to him: Happy are all of you, and happy are the mothers who gave birth to you; happy are my eyes that saw this, students such as these. 

וְאַף אֲנִי וְאַתֶּם, בַּחֲלוֹמִי מְסוּבִּין הַיְינוּ עַל הַר סִינַי, וְנִתְּנָה עָלֵינוּ בַּת קוֹל מִן הַשָּׁמַיִם: 

As for you and I, I saw in my dream that we were seated at Mount Sinai, and a Divine Voice came to us from heaven: 

עֲלוּ לְכָאן, עֲלוּ לְכָאן! 

Ascend here, ascend here, 

טְרַקְלִין גְּדוֹלִים וּמַצָּעוֹת נָאוֹת מוּצָּעוֹת לָכֶם, 

for large halls [teraklin] and pleasant couches are made up for you. 

אַתֶּם, וְתַלְמִידֵיכֶם, וְתַלְמִידֵי תַלְמִידֵיכֶם מְזוּמָּנִין לְכַת שְׁלִישִׁית.

You, your students, and the students of your students are invited to the third group, those who will merit to welcome the Divine Presence.
##### 7
The Gemara poses a question: 

אִינִי?! 

Is that so? 

וְהָתַנְיָא, 

But isn’t it taught in a baraita: 

רַבִּי יוֹסֵי בְּרַבִּי יְהוּדָה אוֹמֵר: שְׁלֹשָׁה הַרְצָאוֹת הֵן, 

Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says: There are three lectures. 

In other words, there are three Sages with regard to whom it states that they delivered lectures on the mystical tradition: 

רַבִּי יְהוֹשֻׁעַ הִרְצָה דְּבָרִים לִפְנֵי רַבָּן יוֹחָנָן בֶּן זַכַּאי, רַבִּי עֲקִיבָא הִרְצָה לִפְנֵי רַבִּי יְהוֹשֻׁעַ, חֲנַנְיָא בֶּן חֲכִינַאי הִרְצָה לִפְנֵי רַבִּי עֲקִיבָא. 

Rabbi Yehoshua lectured on these matters before Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai; Rabbi Akiva lectured before Rabbi Yehoshua; and Ḥananya ben Ḥakhinai lectured before Rabbi Akiva. 

וְאִילּוּ רַבִּי אֶלְעָזָר בֶּן עֲרָךְ לָא קָא חָשֵׁיב! 

However, Rabbi Elazar ben Arakh was not included in the list, 

despite the testimony that he lectured before Rabban Yoḥanan. 

דְּאַרְצִי וְאַרְצוֹ קַמֵּיהּ — קָחָשֵׁיב, דְּאַרְצִי וְלָא אַרְצוֹ קַמֵּיהּ — לָא קָא חָשֵׁיב. 

The Gemara explains: Those who lectured and were also lectured to were included; but those who lectured and were not lectured to were not included. 

The Gemara asks: But wasn’t there Ḥananya ben Ḥakhinai, who was not lectured to, and yet he is included? 

וְהָא חֲנַנְיָא בֶּן חֲכִינַאי דְּלָא אַרְצוֹ קַמֵּיהּ, וְקָא חָשֵׁיב! דְּאַרְצִי מִיהָא קַמֵּיהּ מַאן דְּאַרְצִי.

The Gemara answers: Ḥananya ben Ḥakhinai actually lectured before one who lectured in front of his own rabbi, so he was also included in this list.
##### 8
תָּנוּ רַבָּנַן: אַרְבָּעָה נִכְנְסוּ בַּפַּרְדֵּס, 

§ The Sages taught: Four entered the orchard [pardes], 

i.e., dealt with the loftiest secrets of Torah, 

וְאֵלּוּ הֵן: 

and they are as follows: 

בֶּן עַזַּאי, וּבֶן זוֹמָא, אַחֵר, וְרַבִּי עֲקִיבָא. 

Ben Azzai; and ben Zoma; Aḥer, the other, a name for Elisha ben Avuya; and Rabbi Akiva. 

אֲמַר לָהֶם רַבִּי עֲקִיבָא: 

Rabbi Akiva, the senior among them, said to them: 

כְּשֶׁאַתֶּם מַגִּיעִין אֵצֶל אַבְנֵי שַׁיִשׁ טָהוֹר, אַל תֹּאמְרוּ 

When, upon your arrival in the upper worlds, you reach pure marble stones, do not say: 

״מַיִם מַיִם״, 
Water, water, 

although they appear to be water, 

מִשּׁוּם שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: 

because it is stated: 

״דּוֹבֵר שְׁקָרִים לֹא יִכּוֹן לְנֶגֶד עֵינָי״.

“He who speaks falsehood shall not be established before My eyes” (Psalms 101:7).
##### 9
The Gemara proceeds to relate what happened to each of them: 

בֶּן עַזַּאי הֵצִיץ וָמֵת, עָלָיו הַכָּתוּב אוֹמֵר: 

Ben Azzai glimpsed at the Divine Presence and died. And with regard to him the verse states: 

״יָקָר בְּעֵינֵי ה׳ הַמָּוְתָה לַחֲסִידָיו״. 

“Precious in the eyes of the Lord is the death of His pious ones” (Psalms 116:15). 

בֶּן זוֹמָא הֵצִיץ וְנִפְגַּע, וְעָלָיו הַכָּתוּב אוֹמֵר: 

Ben Zoma glimpsed at the Divine Presence and was harmed, i.e., he lost his mind. And with regard to him the verse states: 

״דְּבַשׁ מָצָאתָ אֱכוֹל דַּיֶּיךָּ פֶּן תִּשְׂבָּעֶנּוּ וַהֲקֵאתוֹ״. 

“Have you found honey? Eat as much as is sufficient for you, lest you become full from it and vomit it” (Proverbs 25:16). 

אַחֵר קִיצֵּץ בִּנְטִיעוֹת. 

Aḥer chopped down the shoots of saplings. In other words, he became a heretic. 

רַבִּי עֲקִיבָא יָצָא בְּשָׁלוֹם.

Rabbi Akiva came out safely.
##### 10
The Gemara recounts the greatness of ben Zoma, who was an expert interpreter of the Torah and could find obscure proofs:

שָׁאֲלוּ אֶת בֶּן זוֹמָא: 

They asked ben Zoma: 

מַהוּ לְסָרוֹסֵי כַּלְבָּא? 

What is the halakha with regard to castrating a dog? 

The prohibition against castration appears alongside the sacrificial blemishes, which may imply that it is permitted to castrate an animal that cannot be sacrificed as an offering. 

אָמַר לָהֶם: 

He said to them: 

The verse states 

“That which has its testicles bruised, or crushed, or torn, or cut, you shall not offer to God, 

״וּבְאַרְצְכֶם לֹא תַעֲשׂוּ״, 

nor shall you do so in your land” (Leviticus 22:24), 

כֹּל שֶׁבְּאַרְצְכֶם לֹא תַעֲשׂוּ. 

from which we learn: With regard to any animal that is in your land, you shall not do such a thing. 

שָׁאֲלוּ אֶת בֶּן זוֹמָא: 

They also asked ben Zoma: 

בְּתוּלָה שֶׁעִיבְּרָה, מַהוּ לְכֹהֵן גָּדוֹל? 

A woman considered to be a virgin who became pregnant, what is the halakha? A High Priest may marry only a virgin; is he permitted to marry her? 

The answer depends on the following: 

מִי חָיְישִׁינַן לְדִשְׁמוּאֵל, דְּאָמַר שְׁמוּאֵל:

Are we concerned for the opinion of Shmuel? Shmuel says:
#### 15.a
##### 1
יָכוֹל אֲנִי לִבְעוֹל כַּמָּה בְּעִילוֹת בְּלֹא דָּם. 

I can engage in intercourse several times without blood. 

In other words, I can have relations with a woman while leaving her hymen intact. If this is so, it is possible that the assumed virgin had intercourse in this manner and is forbidden to the High Priest. 

אוֹ דִלְמָא דִּשְׁמוּאֵל לָא שְׁכִיחָא? 

Or, perhaps a person who can act like Shmuel is not common and the halakha is not concerned with this case. 

אֲמַר לְהוּ: דִּשְׁמוּאֵל לָא שְׁכִיחַ, וְחָיְישִׁינַן שֶׁמָּא בְּאַמְבָּטִי עִיבְּרָה.

He said to them: One like Shmuel is not common, and we are concerned that she may have conceived in a bath. 

Perhaps she washed in a bath that contained a man’s semen, from which she became impregnated while remaining a virgin.
##### 2
The Gemara asks: How could she possibly become pregnant in such a manner? 

וְהָאָמַר שְׁמוּאֵל: כׇּל שִׁכְבַת זֶרַע שֶׁאֵינוֹ יוֹרֶה כְּחֵץ — 

Didn’t Shmuel say: Any semen that is not shot like an arrow cannot fertilize? 

The Gemara answers: 

אֵינָהּ מַזְרַעַת! 

This does not mean that it must be shot like an arrow at the moment of fertilization. 

מֵעִיקָּרָא נָמֵי יוֹרֶה כְּחֵץ הֲוָה.

Even if initially, when released from the male, it was shot as an arrow, it can also fertilize a woman at a later moment.
##### 3
תָּנוּ רַבָּנַן: 

With regard to the fate of ben Zoma, the Sages taught: 

מַעֲשֶׂה בְּרַבִּי יְהוֹשֻׁעַ בֶּן חֲנַנְיָה שֶׁהָיָה עוֹמֵד עַל גַּב מַעֲלָה בְּהַר הַבַּיִת, וְרָאָהוּ בֶּן זוֹמָא וְלֹא עָמַד מִלְּפָנָיו. 

There was once an incident with regard to Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya, who was standing on a step on the Temple Mount, and ben Zoma saw him and did not stand before him to honor him, as he was deep in thought. 

אָמַר לוֹ: מֵאַיִן וּלְאַיִן בֶּן זוֹמָא? 

Rabbi Yehoshua said to him: From where do you come and where are you going, ben Zoma, i.e., what is on your mind? 

אָמַר לוֹ: צוֹפֶה הָיִיתִי בֵּין מַיִם הָעֶלְיוֹנִים לְמַיִם הַתַּחְתּוֹנִים, וְאֵין בֵּין זֶה לָזֶה אֶלָּא שָׁלֹשׁ אֶצְבָּעוֹת בִּלְבַד, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: 

He said to him: In my thoughts I was looking upon the act of Creation, at the gap between the upper waters and the lower waters, as there is only the breadth of a mere three fingers between them, as it is stated: 

״וְרוּחַ אֱלֹהִים מְרַחֶפֶת עַל פְּנֵי הַמָּיִם״ — 

“And the spirit of God hovered over the face of the waters” (Genesis 1:2), 

כְּיוֹנָה שֶׁמְּרַחֶפֶת עַל בָּנֶיהָ וְאֵינָהּ נוֹגַעַת. 

like a dove hovering over its young without touching them. 

אָמַר לָהֶן רַבִּי יְהוֹשֻׁעַ לְתַלְמִידָיו: עֲדַיִין בֶּן זוֹמָא מִבַּחוּץ.

Rabbi Yehoshua said to his students who had overheard this exchange: Ben Zoma is still outside; 

he has not yet achieved full understanding of these matters.
##### 4
The Gemara explains: 

מִכְּדֵי 

Now, this verse: 

״וְרוּחַ אֱלֹהִים מְרַחֶפֶת עַל פְּנֵי הַמָּיִם״ 

“And the spirit of God hovered over the face of the waters,” 

אֵימַת הָוֵי — בַּיּוֹם הָרִאשׁוֹן, הַבְדָּלָה — בְּיוֹם שֵׁנִי הוּא דַּהֲוַאי, דִּכְתִיב: 

when was it stated? On the first day, whereas the division of the waters occurred on the second day, as it is written: 

״וִיהִי מַבְדִּיל בֵּין מַיִם לָמָיִם״. 

“And let it divide the waters from the waters” (Genesis 1:6). 

וְכַמָּה? 

How, then, could ben Zoma derive a proof from the former verse? 

The Gemara asks: And how much, in fact, is the gap between them? 

אָמַר רַב אַחָא בַּר יַעֲקֹב: כִּמְלֹא נִימָא. 

Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: Like the thickness of a thread; 

וְרַבָּנַן אָמְרִי: כִּי גוּדָּא דְגַמְלָא. 

and the Rabbis said: Like the gap between the boards of a bridge. 

מָר זוּטְרָא, וְאִיתֵּימָא רַב אַסִּי אָמַר: כִּתְרֵי גְלִימֵי דִּפְרִיסִי אַהֲדָדֵי. 

Mar Zutra, and some say it was Rav Asi, said: Like two robes spread one over the other, with a slight gap in between. 

וְאָמְרִי לַהּ: כִּתְרֵי כָסֵי דִּסְחִיפִי אַהֲדָדֵי.

And some said: Like two cups placed one upon the other.

The Gemara stated earlier that 

אַחֵר קִיצֵּץ בִּנְטִיעוֹת, עָלָיו הַכָּתוּב אוֹמֵר: 

Aḥer chopped down the saplings, becoming a heretic. 

With regard to him, the verse states: 

״אַל תִּתֵּן אֶת פִּיךָ לַחֲטִיא אֶת בְּשָׂרֶךָ״. 

“Do not let your mouth bring your flesh into guilt” (Ecclesiastes 5:5).

The Gemara poses a question: 

מַאי הִיא? 

What was it that led him to heresy? 

חֲזָא מֶיטַטְרוֹן דְּאִתְיְהִבָא לֵיהּ רְשׁוּתָא לְמֵיתַב לְמִיכְתַּב זַכְווֹתָא דְיִשְׂרָאֵל,  

He saw the angel Mitatron, who was granted permission to sit and write the merits of Israel. 

אֲמַר: 

He said: 

גְּמִירִי דִּלְמַעְלָה לָא הָוֵי לֹא יְשִׁיבָה וְלֹא תַּחֲרוּת, וְלֹא עוֹרֶף 

There is a tradition that in the world above there is no sitting; no competition; no turning one’s back before Him, 

i.e., all face the Divine Presence; 

וְלֹא עִיפּוּי. 

and no lethargy. 

Seeing that someone other than God was seated above, he said: 

Perhaps, the Gemara here interjects, 

שֶׁמָּא, חַס וְשָׁלוֹם,
Heaven forbid, 

שְׁתֵּי רְשׁוּיוֹת הֵן.

there are two authorities, 

and there is another source of power in control of the world in addition to God. 

Such thoughts led Aḥer to heresy.
##### 6
The Gemara relates: 

אַפְּקוּהּ לְמֶיטַטְרוֹן ומַחְיוּהּ שִׁיתִּין פּוּלְסֵי דְנוּרָא. 

They removed Mitatron from his place in heaven and smote him with sixty rods [pulsei] of fire, so that others would not make the mistake that Aḥer made. 

אֲמַרוּ לֵיהּ: 

They said to the angel: 

מַאי טַעְמָא כִּי חֲזִיתֵיהּ לָא קַמְתְּ מִקַּמֵּיהּ? 

What is the reason that when you saw Elisha ben Avuya you did not stand before him? 

אִיתְיְהִיבָא לֵיהּ רְשׁוּתָא לְמִימְחַק זַכְווֹתָא דְאַחֵר. 

Despite this conduct, since Mitatron was personally involved, he was granted permission to erase the merits of Aḥer and cause him to stumble in any manner. 

יָצְתָה בַּת קוֹל וְאָמְרָה: 

A Divine Voice went forth saying: 

״שׁוּבוּ בָּנִים שׁוֹבָבִים״ — 

“Return, rebellious children” (Jeremiah 3:22), 

חוּץ מֵאַחֵר.

apart from Aḥer.
##### 7
אֲמַר: 

Upon hearing this, Elisha ben Avuya said: 

הוֹאִיל וְאִיטְּרִיד הָהוּא גַּבְרָא מֵהָהוּא עָלְמָא, לִיפּוֹק לִיתְהֲנֵי בְּהַאי עָלְמָא. 

Since that man, meaning himself, has been banished from that world, let him go out and enjoy this world. 

נְפַק אַחֵר לְתַרְבּוּת רָעָה. נְפַק, אַשְׁכַּח זוֹנָה תַּבְעַהּ, 

Aḥer went astray. He went and found a prostitute and solicited her for intercourse. 

אֲמַרָה לֵיהּ: וְלָאו אֱלִישָׁע בֶּן אֲבוּיָה אַתְּ? 

She said to him: And are you not Elisha ben Avuya? Shall a person of your stature perform such an act? 

עֲקַר פּוּגְלָא מִמֵּישְׁרָא בְּשַׁבָּת וִיהַב לַהּ, 

He uprooted a radish from a patch of radishes on Shabbat and gave it to her, 

to demonstrate that he no longer observed the Torah. 

אָמְרָה: אַחֵר הוּא.

The prostitute said: He is other than he was. 

He is not the same Elisha ben Avuya, he is Aḥer, other.
##### 8
The Gemara relates: 

שָׁאַל אַחֵר אֶת רַבִּי מֵאִיר לְאַחַר שֶׁיָּצָא לְתַרְבּוּת רָעָה, 

Aḥer asked Rabbi Meir a question, after he had gone astray. 

אֲמַר לֵיהּ: 

He said to him: 

מַאי דִּכְתִיב: 

What is the meaning of that which is written: 

״גַּם אֶת זֶה לְעוּמַּת זֶה עָשָׂה הָאֱלֹהִים״? 

“God has made even the one as well as the other” (Ecclesiastes 7:14)? 

אָמַר לוֹ: 
Rabbi Meir said to him: 

כׇּל מַה שֶּׁבָּרָא הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא, בָּרָא כְּנֶגְדּוֹ. 

Everything that the Holy One, Blessed be He, created, He created a similar creation corresponding to it. 

בָּרָא הָרִים — בָּרָא גְּבָעוֹת, בָּרָא יַמִּים — בָּרָא נְהָרוֹת.

He created mountains, He created hills; He created seas, He created rivers.
##### 9
אָמַר לוֹ: רַבִּי עֲקִיבָא רַבְּךָ לֹא אָמַר כָּךְ, 

 Aḥer said to him: Rabbi Akiva, your teacher, did not say so, but explained the verse as follows: 
 
 אֶלָּא: 
Everything has its opposite: 
 
 בָּרָא צַדִּיקִים בָּרָא רְשָׁעִים, בָּרָא גַּן עֵדֶן בָּרָא גֵּיהִנָּם. 
 
 He created the righteous, He created the wicked; He created the Garden of Eden, He created Gehenna. 
 
 כׇּל אֶחָד וְאֶחָד יֵשׁ לוֹ שְׁנֵי חֲלָקִים, אֶחָד בְּגַן עֵדֶן וְאֶחָד בְּגֵיהִנָּם. 
 
 Each and every person has two portions, one in the Garden of Eden and one in Gehenna. 
 
 זָכָה צַדִּיק — נָטַל חֶלְקוֹ וְחֵלֶק חֲבֵרוֹ בְּגַן עֵדֶן, 
 
 If he merits it, by becoming righteous, he takes his portion and the portion of his wicked colleague in the Garden of Eden; 
 
 נִתְחַיֵּיב רָשָׁע — נָטַל חֶלְקוֹ וְחֵלֶק חֲבֵרוֹ בְּגֵיהִנָּם.
 
 if he is found culpable by becoming wicked, he takes his portion and the portion of his colleague in Gehenna.
##### 10
אָמַר רַב מְשַׁרְשְׁיָא: 

Rav Mesharshiyya said: 

מַאי קְרָאָה — 

What is the verse from which it is derived? 

גַּבֵּי צַדִּיקִים כְּתִיב: 

With regard to the righteous, it is stated: 

״לָכֵן בְּאַרְצָם מִשְׁנֶה יִירָשׁוּ״, 

“Therefore in their land they shall possess double” (Isaiah 61:7); 

גַּבֵּי רְשָׁעִים כְּתִיב: 

whereas with regard to the wicked, it is stated: 

״וּמִשְׁנֶה שִׁבָּרוֹן שׇׁבְרֵם״.

“And destroy them with double destruction” (Jeremiah 17:18); 

therefore, each receives a double portion.
##### 11
שָׁאַל אַחֵר אֶת רַבִּי מֵאִיר לְאַחַר שֶׁיָּצָא לְתַרְבּוּת רָעָה, 

Aḥer asked Rabbi Meir another question, again after he had gone astray. 

מַאי דִּכְתִיב: 

What is the meaning of that which is written: 

״לֹא יַעַרְכֶנָּה זָהָב וּזְכוֹכִית וּתְמוּרָתָהּ כְּלִי פָז״? 

“Gold and glass cannot equal it; neither shall its exchange be vessels of fine gold” (Job 28:17)? 

If it is referring to the praise and honor of the Torah, it should have compared it only to gold, not to glass. 

אָמַר לוֹ: אֵלּוּ דִּבְרֵי תוֹרָה, שֶׁקָּשִׁין לִקְנוֹתָן כִּכְלֵי זָהָב וּכְלֵי פָז, וְנוֹחִין לְאַבְּדָן כִּכְלֵי זְכוּכִית. 

He said to him: This is referring to words of Torah, which are as difficult to acquire as gilded vessels and vessels of fine gold but are as easy to lose as glass vessels. 

אָמַר לוֹ: רַבִּי עֲקִיבָא רַבָּךְ לֹא אָמַר כָּךְ, אֶלָּא: 

Aḥer said to him: Rabbi Akiva, your teacher, did not say so, but taught as follows: 

מָה כְּלֵי זָהָב וּכְלֵי זְכוּכִית, אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁנִּשְׁבְּרוּ — יֵשׁ לָהֶם תַּקָּנָה, אַף תַּלְמִיד חָכָם, אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁסָּרַח — יֵשׁ לוֹ תַּקָּנָה. 

Just as golden vessels and glass vessels have a remedy even when they have broken, as they can be melted down and made into new vessels, so too a Torah scholar, although he has transgressed, has a remedy. 

אָמַר לוֹ: אַף אַתָּה חֲזוֹר בָּךְ! 

Rabbi Meir said to him: If so, you too, return from your ways. 

אָמַר לוֹ: כְּבָר שָׁמַעְתִּי מֵאֲחוֹרֵי הַפַּרְגּוֹד: 

He said to him: I have already heard the following declaration behind the dividing curtain, which conceals God from the world: 

״שׁוּבוּ בָּנִים שׁוֹבָבִים״ — 

“Return, rebellious children,” (Jeremiah 3:22) 

חוּץ מֵאַחֵר.

apart from Aḥer.
##### 12
The Gemara cites a related story: 

תָּנוּ רַבָּנַן: 

The Sages taught: 

מַעֲשֶׂה בְּאַחֵר שֶׁהָיָה רוֹכֵב עַל הַסּוּס בְּשַׁבָּת, וְהָיָה רַבִּי מֵאִיר מְהַלֵּךְ אַחֲרָיו לִלְמוֹד תּוֹרָה מִפִּיו, 

There was once an incident involving Aḥer, who was riding on a horse on Shabbat, and Rabbi Meir was walking behind him to learn Torah from him. 

אָמַר לוֹ: מֵאִיר, חֲזוֹר לְאַחֲרֶיךָ, שֶׁכְּבָר שִׁיעַרְתִּי בְּעִקְבֵי סוּסִי עַד כָּאן תְּחוּם שַׁבָּת. 

After a while, Aḥer said to him: Meir, turn back, for I have already estimated and measured according to the steps of my horse that the Shabbat boundary ends here, and you may therefore venture no further. 

אָמַר לוֹ: אַף אַתָּה חֲזוֹר בָּךְ. 

Rabbi Meir said to him: You, too, return to the correct path. 

אָמַר לוֹ: וְלֹא כְּבָר אָמַרְתִּי לְךָ כְּבָר שָׁמַעְתִּי מֵאֲחוֹרֵי הַפַּרְגּוֹד: 

He said to him: But have I not already told you that I have already heard behind the dividing curtain: 

״שׁוּבוּ בָּנִים שׁוֹבָבִים״ — 

“Return, rebellious children,” 

חוּץ מֵאַחֵר.

apart from Aḥer?
##### 13
תַּקְפֵיהּ עַיְּילֵיהּ לְבֵי מִדְרְשָׁא, 

Nevertheless, Rabbi Meir took hold of him and brought him to the study hall. 

אֲמַר לֵיהּ לְיָנוֹקָא: 

Aḥer said to a child, by way of divination: 

פְּסוֹק לִי פְּסוּקָךְ. 

Recite your verse that you studied today to me. 

אָמַר לוֹ: 

He recited the following verse to him: 

״אֵין שָׁלוֹם אָמַר ה׳ לָרְשָׁעִים״. 

“There is no peace, said the Lord, concerning the wicked” (Isaiah 48:22). 

עַיְּילֵיהּ לְבֵי כְנִישְׁתָּא אַחֲרִיתִי, 

He brought him to another study hall. 

אֲמַר לֵיהּ לְיָנוֹקָא: פְּסוֹק לִי פְּסוּקָךְ. 

Aḥer said to a child: Recite your verse to me. 

אָמַר לוֹ: ״כִּי אִם תְּכַבְּסִי בַּנֶּתֶר וְתַרְבִּי לָךְ בּוֹרִית נִכְתָּם עֲוֹנֵךְ לְפָנַי״. 

He recited to him: “For though you wash with niter, and take for you much soap, yet your iniquity is marked before Me” (Jeremiah 2:22). 

עַיְּילֵיהּ לְבֵי כְּנִישְׁתָּא אַחֲרִיתִי, אֲמַר לֵיהּ

He brought him to another study hall. Aḥer said to
#### 15.b
##### 1
לְיָנוֹקָא:

a child: 

פְּסוֹק לִי פְּסוּקָךְ. 

Recite your verse to me. 

אֲמַר לֵיהּ: 

He recited to him: 

״וְאַתְּ שָׁדוּד מַה תַּעֲשִׂי כִּי תִלְבְּשִׁי שָׁנִי כִּי תַעְדִּי עֲדִי זָהָב כִּי תִקְרְעִי בַפּוּךְ עֵינַיִךְ לַשָּׁוְא תִּתְיַפִּי וְגוֹ׳״.

“And you, spoiled one, what are you doing, that you clothe yourself with scarlet, that you deck yourself with ornaments of gold, that you enlarge your eyes with paint? In vain you make yourself fair” (Jeremiah 4:30).
##### 2
עַיְּילֵיהּ לְבֵי כְנִישְׁתָּא אַחֲרִיתִי, עַד דְּעַיְּילֵיהּ לִתְלֵיסַר בֵּי כְנִישָׁתָא, כּוּלְּהוּ פְּסַקוּ לֵיהּ כִּי הַאי גַוְונָא. 

He brought him to another synagogue, until he had brought him into thirteen synagogues, where all the children recited to him similar verses that speak of the hopeless situation of the wicked. 

לְבָתְרָא אֲמַר לֵיהּ: פְּסוֹק לִי פְּסוּקָךְ. אֲמַר לֵיהּ: 

At the last one, he said to him: Recite your verse to me. He recited to him: 

״וְלָרָשָׁע אָמַר אֱלֹהִים מַה לְּךָ לְסַפֵּר חֻקָּי וְגוֹ׳״. 

“And to the wicked [velerasha] God says, what is it for you to declare My statutes” (Psalms 50:16). 

הָהוּא יָנוֹקָא הֲוָה מְגַמְגֵּם בְּלִישָּׁנֵיהּ, אִשְׁתְּמַע כְּמָה דַּאֲמַר לֵיהּ: 

The Gemara relates: That child had a stutter, so it sounded as though he were saying to him: 

״וְלֶאֱלִישָׁע אָמַר אֱלֹהִים״, 

Vele’elisha, i.e., and to Elisha, God says. 

אִיכָּא דְּאָמְרִי: סַכִּינָא הֲוָה בַּהֲדֵיהּ, וְקַרְעֵיהּ וְשַׁדַּרֵיהּ לִתְלֵיסַר בֵּי כְנִישָׁתֵי. 

This made Elisha think the child was deliberately insulting him. Some say Aḥer had a knife, and he tore the child apart and sent him to the thirteen synagogues. 

וְאִיכָּא דְּאָמְרִי, אֲמַר: אִי הֲוַאי בִּידִי סַכִּינָא, הֲוָה קָרַעְנָא לֵיהּ.

And others say that Aḥer merely said: Had I a knife, I would have torn him apart.
##### 3
The Gemara relates: 

כִּי נָח נַפְשֵׁיהּ דְּאַחֵר, אָמְרִי: לָא מֵידָן לִידַיְּינֵיהּ, וְלָא לְעָלְמָא דְּאָתֵי לֵיתֵי. 

When Aḥer passed away, the Heavenly Court declared that he should not be judged, nor brought into the World-to-Come. 

לָא מֵידָן לִידַיְּינֵיהּ — מִשּׁוּם דַּעֲסַק בְּאוֹרָיְיתָא, 

He should not be judged in a manner befitting his deeds, because he occupied himself with Torah, whose merit protects him. 

וְלָא לְעָלְמָא דְּאָתֵי לֵיתֵי — מִשּׁוּם דַּחֲטָא. 

And he should not be brought into the World-to-Come because he sinned. 

אֲמַר רַבִּי מֵאִיר: מוּטָב דְּלִידַיְּינֵיהּ וְלֵיתֵי לְעָלְמָא דְּאָתֵי.

Rabbi Meir said: It is better that he be judged properly and be brought into the World-to-Come. 

מָתַי אָמוּת, וְאַעֲלֶה עָשָׁן מִקִּבְרוֹ. 

When I die I will request this of Heaven, and I will cause smoke to rise up from his grave, as a sign that he is being sentenced in Gehenna. 

כִּי נָח נַפְשֵׁיהּ דְּרַבִּי מֵאִיר סְלֵיק קוּטְרָא מִקִּבְרֵיהּ דְּאַחֵר.

The Gemara relates: When Rabbi Meir passed away, smoke rose up from the grave of Aḥer, 

implying that Rabbi Meir’s wish was granted.
##### 4
אָמַר רַבִּי יוֹחָנָן: גְּבוּרְתָּא לְמִיקְלֵי רַבֵּיהּ? 

Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Was this a mighty deed on Rabbi Meir’s part, to burn his teacher? Was this the only remedy available? 

חַד הֲוָה בֵּינַנָא וְלָא מָצֵינַן לְאַצּוֹלֵיהּ? 

Can it be that there was one Sage among us who left the path and we cannot save him? 

אִינְקְטֵיהּ בְּיָד, מַאן מַרְמֵי לֵיהּ מִן. 

If we hold him by the hand, who will remove him from our protection; who? 

אָמַר: מָתַי אָמוּת, וַאֲכַבֶּה עָשָׁן מִקִּבְרוֹ. 

Rabbi Yoḥanan continued and said: When I die I will have the smoke extinguished from his grave, 

as a sign that he has been released from the sentence of Gehenna and brought to the World-to-Come. 

כִּי נָח נַפְשֵׁיהּ דְּרַבִּי יוֹחָנָן פְּסַק קוּטְרָא מִקִּבְרֵיהּ דְּאַחֵר. 

Indeed, when Rabbi Yoḥanan passed away, the smoke ceased to rise up from the grave of Aḥer. 

פְּתַח עֲלֵיהּ הַהוּא סַפְדָנָא: אֲפִילּוּ שׁוֹמֵר הַפֶּתַח לֹא עָמַד לְפָנֶיךָ, רַבֵּינוּ!

A certain eulogizer began his eulogy of Rabbi Yoḥanan with the following: Even the guard at the entrance could not stand before you, our rabbi. 

The guard at the entrance to Gehenna could not prevent Rabbi Yoḥanan from arranging the release of Aḥer.

##### 5
בִּתּוֹ שֶׁל אַחֵר אָתְיָא לְקַמֵּיהּ דְּרַבִּי, אֲמַרָה לֵיהּ: רַבִּי, פַּרְנְסֵנִי. 

The Gemara relates: The daughter of Aḥer came before Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and said to him: Rabbi, provide me with sustenance, as she was in need of food. 

אָמַר לָהּ: בַּת מִי אַתְּ? אָמְרָה לוֹ: בִּתּוֹ שֶׁל אַחֵר אֲנִי. אָמַר לָהּ: עֲדַיִין יֵשׁ מִזַּרְעוֹ בָּעוֹלָם?! וְהָא כְּתִיב: 

He said to her: Whose daughter are you? She said to him: I am the daughter of Aḥer. He said to her, angrily: Is there still of his seed remaining in the world? But isn’t it stated: 

״לֹא נִין לוֹ וְלֹא נֶכֶד בְּעַמּוֹ וְאֵין שָׂרִיד בִּמְגוּרָיו״! 

“He shall have neither son nor grandson among his people or any remaining in his dwellings” (Job 18:19)? 

אָמְרָה לוֹ: זְכוֹר לְתוֹרָתוֹ, וְאַל תִּזְכּוֹר מַעֲשָׂיו. 

She said to him: Remember his Torah, and do not remember his deeds. 

מִיָּד יָרְדָה אֵשׁ וְסִכְסְכָה סַפְסָלוֹ שֶׁל רַבִּי. 

Immediately, fire descended and licked Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s bench. 

בָּכָה וְאָמַר רַבִּי: וּמָה לַמִּתְגַּנִּין בָּהּ — כָּךְ, לַמִּשְׁתַּבְּחִין בָּהּ — עַל אַחַת כַּמָּה וְכַמָּה!

Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi wept and said: If God protects the honor of those who treat the Torah with contempt in such a manner, as Aḥer despised the Torah and relinquished its teachings, how much more so would He do for those who treat it with honor.
##### 6
The Gemara poses a question: 

וְרַבִּי מֵאִיר, הֵיכִי גְּמַר תּוֹרָה מִפּוּמֵּיהּ דְּאַחֵר? 

And Rabbi Meir, how could he learn Torah from the mouth of Aḥer? 

וְהָאָמַר רַבָּה בַּר בַּר חָנָה אָמַר רַבִּי יוֹחָנָן: מַאי דִּכְתִיב: 

But didn’t Rabba bar bar Ḥana say that Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What is the meaning of that which is written: 

״כִּי שִׂפְתֵי כֹהֵן יִשְׁמְרוּ דַעַת וְתוֹרָה יְבַקְשׁוּ מִפִּיהוּ כִּי מַלְאַךְ ה׳ צְבָאוֹת הוּא״. 

“For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek Torah from his mouth; for he is an angel of the Lord of hosts” (Malachi 2:7)? 

אִם דּוֹמֶה הָרַב לְמַלְאַךְ ה׳ צְבָאוֹת — יְבַקְּשׁוּ תּוֹרָה מִפִּיהוּ, וְאִם לָאו — אַל יְבַקְּשׁוּ תּוֹרָה מִפִּיהוּ!

The verse teaches: If the rabbi is similar to an angel of the Lord of hosts, perfect in his ways, they should seek Torah from his mouth; but if not, they should not seek Torah from his mouth.
##### 7
אָמַר רֵישׁ לָקִישׁ: רַבִּי מֵאִיר — קְרָא אַשְׁכַּח וּדְרַשׁ: 

Reish Lakish said: Rabbi Meir found a verse and interpreted it homiletically: 

״הַט אׇזְנְךָ וּשְׁמַע דִּבְרֵי חֲכָמִים וְלִבְּךָ תָּשִׁית לְדַעְתִּי״, 

“Incline your ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply your heart to My knowledge” (Proverbs 22:17). 

״לְדַעְתָּם״ לֹא נֶאֱמַר, אֶלָּא ״לְדַעְתִּי״.

It does not state “to their knowledge,” but “to My knowledge.” 

In other words, one must listen to the words of the Sages, despite their flaws, provided that their opinion concurs with that of God.
##### 8
רַב חֲנִינָא אָמַר מֵהָכָא: 

Rav Ḥanina said that one can find support for this idea from here: 

״שִׁמְעִי בַת וּרְאִי וְהַטִּי אׇזְנֵךְ וְשִׁכְחִי עַמֵּךְ וּבֵית אָבִיךְ וְגוֹ׳״.

“Listen, daughter and consider, and incline your ear; forget also your own people and your father’s house” (Psalms 45:11), 

which likewise indicates that one must listen to the words of a Sage while forgetting, i.e., ignoring, the faulty aspects of his teachings.
##### 9
קָשׁוּ קְרָאֵי אַהֲדָדֵי? 

The Gemara asks: If so, the verses contradict each other, for one source states that one may learn only from a scholar who is perfect in his ways, while the other indicates that it is permitted even to learn from one whose character is flawed. 

לָא קַשְׁיָא: 

The Gemara answers: This is not difficult. 

הָא בְּגָדוֹל, 

This case, in which it is permitted to learn from a flawed scholar, is referring to an adult; 

הָא בְּקָטָן.

whereas that case, which prohibits doing so, is referring to a minor, who should learn only from a righteous person, so that his ways are not corrupted by a teacher with flawed character.

כִּי אֲתָא רַב דִּימִי, אֲמַר, אָמְרִי בְּמַעְרְבָא: רַבִּי מֵאִיר אֲכַל תַּחְלָא, וּשְׁדָא שִׁיחְלָא לְבָרָא. 

When Rav Dimi came from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said: In the West, Eretz Yisrael, they say: Rabbi Meir ate a half-ripe date and threw the peel away. 

In other words, he was able to extract the important content from the inedible shell. 

דָּרֵשׁ רָבָא: מַאי דִּכְתִיב: 

Rava taught: What is the meaning of that which is written: 

״אֶל גִּנַּת אֱגוֹז יָרַדְתִּי לִרְאוֹת בְּאִבֵּי הַנָּחַל וְגוֹ׳״, 

“I went down into the garden of nuts, to look at the green plants of the valley” (Song of Songs 6:11)? 

לָמָּה נִמְשְׁלוּ תַּלְמִידֵי חֲכָמִים לֶאֱגוֹז — לוֹמַר לָךְ: מָה אֱגוֹז זֶה, אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁמְּלוּכְלָךְ בְּטִיט וּבְצוֹאָה — אֵין מַה שֶּׁבְּתוֹכוֹ נִמְאָס; אַף תַּלְמִיד חָכָם, אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁסָּרַח — אֵין תּוֹרָתוֹ נִמְאֶסֶת.

Why are Torah scholars compared to nuts? To tell you: Just as this nut, despite being soiled with mud and excrement, its content is not made repulsive, as only its shell is soiled; so too a Torah scholar, although he has sinned, his Torah is not made repulsive.

אַשְׁכְּחֵיהּ רַבָּה בַּר שֵׁילָא לְאֵלִיָּהוּ. 

The Gemara relates: Rabba bar Sheila found Elijah the prophet, who had appeared to him. 

אֲמַר לֵיהּ: מַאי קָא עָבֵיד הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא? 

He said to Elijah: What is the Holy One, Blessed be He, doing? 

אֲמַר לֵיהּ: קָאָמַר שְׁמַעְתָּא מִפּוּמַּיְיהוּ דְּכוּלְּהוּ רַבָּנַן, וּמִפּוּמֵּיהּ דְּרַבִּי מֵאִיר לָא קָאָמַר. 

Elijah said to him: He is stating halakhot transmitted by all of the Sages, but in the name of Rabbi Meir He will not speak. 

אֲמַר לֵיהּ: אַמַּאי? 

He said to him: Why? 

מִשּׁוּם דְּקָא גָמַר שְׁמַעְתָּא מִפּוּמֵּיהּ דְּאַחֵר. 
He replied: Because he learned halakhot from the mouth of Aḥer. 

אָמַר לֵיהּ: אַמַּאי? 

He said to him: Why should he be judged unfavorably for that? 

רַבִּי מֵאִיר רִמּוֹן מָצָא, תּוֹכוֹ אָכַל, קְלִיפָּתוֹ זָרַק. 

Rabbi Meir found a pomegranate and ate its contents while throwing away its peel. 

אֲמַר לֵיהּ: הַשְׁתָּא קָאָמַר, מֵאִיר בְּנִי אוֹמֵר: בִּזְמַן שֶׁאָדָם מִצְטַעֵר, שְׁכִינָה מָה לָשׁוֹן אוֹמֶרֶת: 

He said to him: Indeed, your defense has been heard above. Now God is saying: My son, Meir, says: When a person suffers, e.g., by receiving lashes or the death penalty at the hands of the court, how does the Divine Presence express itself? 

קַלַּנִי מֵרֹאשִׁי, קַלַּנִי מִזְּרוֹעִי. 

Woe is Me from My head, woe is Me from My arm, 

as God empathizes with the sufferer. 

אִם כָּךְ הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא מִצְטַעֵר עַל דָּמָן שֶׁל רְשָׁעִים — קַל וָחוֹמֶר עַל דָּמָן שֶׁל צַדִּיקִים שֶׁנִּשְׁפַּךְ.

If the Holy One, Blessed be He, suffers to such an extent over the blood of the wicked, how much more so does He suffer over the blood of the righteous that is spilled.
##### 12
The Gemara relates: 

אַשְׁכְּחֵיהּ שְׁמוּאֵל לְרַב יְהוּדָה דִּתְלֵי בְּעִיבְרָא דְּדַשָּׁא וְקָא בָכֵי. אָמַר לֵיהּ: שִׁינָּנָא! מַאי קָא בָכֵית? 

Shmuel found Rav Yehuda leaning on the bar of the door, crying. He said to him: Long-toothed one [shinnana], what are you crying for? 

אֲמַר לֵיהּ: מִי זוּטְרָא מַאי דִּכְתִיב בְּהוּ בְּרַבָּנַן: 

He said to him: Is it a small matter, that which is written with regard to Sages who have sinned: 

״אַיֵּה סוֹפֵר אַיֵּה שׁוֹקֵל אַיֵּה סוֹפֵר אֶת הַמִּגְדָּלִים״. 

“Where is he who counted, where is he who weighed? Where is he who counted the towers?” (Isaiah 33:18). 

He proceeded to explain: 

״אַיֵּה סוֹפֵר״ — 

“Where is he who counted”; 

שֶׁהָיוּ סוֹפְרִים כׇּל אוֹתִיּוֹת שֶׁבַּתּוֹרָה. 

for they would count all the letters of the Torah. 

״אַיֵּה שׁוֹקֵל״ — 

“Where is he who weighed”; 

שֶׁהָיוּ שׁוֹקְלִים קַלִּין וַחֲמוּרִין שֶׁבַּתּוֹרָה. 

for they would weigh and compare the minor and major transgressions of the Torah. 

״אַיֵּה סוֹפֵר אֶת הַמִּגְדָּלִים״ — 

“Where is he who counted the towers”; 

שֶׁהָיוּ שׁוֹנִין שְׁלֹשׁ מֵאוֹת הֲלָכוֹת בְּמִגְדָּל הַפּוֹרֵחַ בָּאֲוִיר.

for they would teach three hundred halakhot concerning the details of tent impurity involving a wooden closet floating in the air. 

If they studied a subject so removed from reality in such depths, how much more so did they analyze other issues.
##### 13
וְאָמַר רַבִּי אַמֵּי: תְּלָת מְאָה בַּעְיֵי בְּעוֹ דּוֹאֵג וַאֲחִיתוֹפֶל בְּמִגְדָּל הַפּוֹרֵחַ בָּאֲוִיר. 

And Rabbi Ami said: Doeg asked Ahithophel three hundred questions with regard to a closet floating in the air, as they were both great Torah scholars. 

וּתְנַן: שְׁלֹשָׁה מְלָכִים וְאַרְבָּעָה הֶדְיוֹטוֹת אֵין לָהֶם חֵלֶק לָעוֹלָם הַבָּא. 

And we learned in a mishna (Sanhedrin 90a): Three kings and four commoners have no portion in the World-to-Come, a list that includes Doeg and Ahithophel. 

אֲנַן מָה תִּהְוֵי עֲלַן? 

If such great Sages could sin and forfeit their share in the World-to-Come, we, who are less knowledgeable than they, what will be of us? 

אֲמַר לֵיהּ: שִׁינָּנָא! טִינָא הָיְתָה בְּלִבָּם.

He said to him: Long-toothed one, there was mud [tina] in their hearts, i.e., they had certain flaws that prevented their Torah learning from protecting them.
##### 14
אַחֵר מַאי — 

The Gemara explains: Aḥer, what was his failing? 

זֶמֶר יְווֹנִי לָא פְּסַק מִפּוּמֵּיהּ. 

Greek tunes never ceased from his mouth. 

אָמְרוּ עָלָיו עַל אַחֵר: 

He would constantly hum Greek songs, even when he was among the Sages. 

This shows that from the outset he was drawn to gentile culture and beliefs. 

Similarly, they said about Aḥer: 

בְּשָׁעָה שֶׁהָיָה עוֹמֵד מִבֵּית הַמִּדְרָשׁ, הַרְבֵּה סִפְרֵי מִינִין נוֹשְׁרִין מֵחֵיקוֹ.

When he would stand after learning in the study hall, many heretical books, which he had been reading, would fall from his lap. Therefore, he was somewhat unsound even when among the Sages.

שָׁאַל נִימוֹס הַגַּרְדִּי אֶת רַבִּי מֵאִיר: כֹּל עֲמַר דְּנָחֵית לְיוֹרָה סָלֵיק? 

The gentile philosopher, Nimos HaGardi, asked Rabbi Meir: Does all wool that enters the cauldron to be dyed emerge colored? 

In other words, do all those who learn Torah emerge as decent and worthy? 

אֲמַר לֵיהּ: כֹּל מַאן דַּהֲוָה נְקֵי אַגַּב אִימֵּיהּ — סָלֵיק, כֹּל דְּלָא הֲוָה נְקֵי אַגַּב אִימֵּיהּ — לָא סָלֵיק.

He said to him: Whoever was clean when he was with his mother, from the outset, will emerge decent and worthy, but all those who were not clean when they were with their mother will not emerge worthy. One who approaches Torah study having been flawed from the outset will not be properly influenced by it.

§ The Gemara returns to the four who entered the orchard. 

רַבִּי עֲקִיבָא עָלָה בְּשָׁלוֹם וְיָרַד בְּשָׁלוֹם, וְעָלָיו הַכָּתוּב אוֹמֵר: 

It is stated above that Rabbi Akiva ascended in safety and descended safely. With regard to him, the verse states: 

״מׇשְׁכֵנִי אַחֲרֶיךָ נָרוּצָה״. 

“Draw me, we will run after you; the king has brought me into his chambers” (Song of Songs 1:4). 

The Gemara relates: 

וְאַף רַבִּי עֲקִיבָא בִּקְּשׁוּ מַלְאֲכֵי הַשָּׁרֵת לְדוֹחְפוֹ, 

And even Rabbi Akiva, the ministering angels sought to push him out of the orchard. 

אָמַר לָהֶם הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא: הַנִּיחוּ לְזָקֵן זֶה, שֶׁרָאוּי לְהִשְׁתַּמֵּשׁ בִּכְבוֹדִי.

אָמַר רַבָּה בַּר בַּר חָנָה אָמַר רַבִּי יוֹחָנָן: 

Rabba bar bar Ḥana said that Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It was the following: 

״וְאָתָא מֵרִבְבוֹת קֹדֶשׁ״ — 

“And He came [ve’ata] from the holy myriads” (Deuteronomy 33:2), 

אוֹת הוּא בָּרְבָבָה שֶׁלּוֹ.

which he explained in this manner: He, God, is unique [ot] among His myriads of angels. Therefore, he knew that he had merely seen an angel.

וְרַבִּי אֲבָהוּ אָמַר: 

And Rabbi Abbahu said: Rabbi Akiva expounded the verse:

דּוּגְמָא הוּא בָּרְבָבָה שֶׁלּוֹ.

to indicate that He is exemplary among His myriad.

He is the Master in His host.

וְרַבִּי חִיָּיא בַּר אַבָּא אָמַר רַבִּי יוֹחָנָן:

״לֹא בָרוּחַ ה׳ וְאַחַר הָרוּחַ רַעַשׁ לֹא בָרַעַשׁ ה׳. וְאַחַר הָרַעַשׁ אֵשׁ לֹא בָאֵשׁ ה׳ וְאַחַר הָאֵשׁ קוֹל דְּמָמָה דַקָּה״, 

“But the Lord was not in the wind. And after the wind, an earthquake; the Lord was not in the earthquake. And after the earthquake, fire; but the Lord was not in the fire. And after the fire, a still, small voice,” 

and it states in that verse: 

״וְהִנֵּה ה׳ עוֹבֵר״.

“And behold, the Lord passed by” (I Kings 19:11–12). 

Rabbi Akiva used this verse in order to recognize the place of His presence and refrain from trespassing there

The Gemara returns to discussing the heavenly beings. 

תָּנוּ רַבָּנַן, שִׁשָּׁה דְּבָרִים נֶאֶמְרוּ בַּשֵּׁדִים: 

The Sages taught: Six statements were said with regard to demons: 

שְׁלֹשָׁה כְּמַלְאֲכֵי הַשָּׁרֵת, וּשְׁלֹשָׁה כִּבְנֵי אָדָם. 

In three ways they are like ministering angels, and in three ways they are like humans. 

שְׁלֹשָׁה כְּמַלְאֲכֵי הַשָּׁרֵת — 

The baraita specifies: In three ways they are like ministering angels: 

יֵשׁ לָהֶם כְּנָפַיִם כְּמַלְאֲכֵי הַשָּׁרֵת, וְטָסִין מִסּוֹף הָעוֹלָם וְעַד סוֹפוֹ כְּמַלְאֲכֵי הַשָּׁרֵת, וְיוֹדְעִין מַה שֶּׁעָתִיד לִהְיוֹת כְּמַלְאֲכֵי הַשָּׁרֵת.

They have wings like ministering angels; and they fly from one end of the world to the other like ministering angels; and they know what will be in the future like ministering angels.
##### 6
The Gemara is puzzled by this last statement: 

יוֹדְעִין סָלְקָא דַּעְתָּךְ?! 

Should it enter your mind that they know this? 

Not even the angels are privy to the future. 

אֶלָּא, שׁוֹמְעִין מֵאֲחוֹרֵי הַפַּרְגּוֹד, כְּמַלְאֲכֵי הַשָּׁרֵת.

Rather, they hear from behind the curtain when God reveals something of the future, like ministering angels.
##### 7
וּשְׁלֹשָׁה כִּבְנֵי אָדָם — 

And in three ways they are similar to humans: 

אוֹכְלִין וְשׁוֹתִין כִּבְנֵי אָדָם, פָּרִין וְרָבִין כִּבְנֵי אָדָם, וּמֵתִים כִּבְנֵי אָדָם.

They eat and drink like humans; they multiply like humans; and they die like humans.

The Gemara now discusses the next verse in Exodus: “Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter: Shall I go and call you a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for you?” (Exodus 2:7). The Gemara asks: And what is different that Pharaoh’s daughter would specifically want a nurse of the Hebrew women?

The Gemara answers: This teaches that prior to this, they took Moses around to all the Egyptian wet nurses and he did not agree to nurse from any of them, as he said: Shall a mouth that in the future will speak with the Divine Presence actually nurse something impure? And this is as it is written: “Whom shall one teach knowledge? And whom shall one make understand the message?” (Isaiah 28:9). The prophet is asking: To whom shall God teach the knowledge of the Torah, and to whom shall God make to understand the message of the Torah? The answer is as the verse continues: “Them that are weaned from the milk, them that are drawn from the breasts” (Isaiah 28:9). The conclusion of the verse

After mentioning the spirit named kordeyakos on the previous daf the Gemara relates other matters connected to spirits and demons. It is written: “I got myself sharim and sharot, and human pleasures, shidda and shiddot” [(Ecclesiastes 2:8)](bbl.poetry#eccl#c2#8).

The Gemara explains: “Sharim and sharot”: These are types of musical instruments. “And human pleasures”: These are pools and bathhouses. “Shidda and shiddot”: Here, in Babylonia, they interpreted these words in the following manner: Male demons [shidda] and female demons [shiddetin]. In the West, Eretz Yisrael, they said that these words are referring to carriages [shiddeta].

אָמַר מָר, הָכָא תַּרְגִּימוּ: שֵׁידָא וְשֵׁידְתִין. שֵׁידָה וְשֵׁידְתִין – לְמַאי אִיבְּעִי לֵיהּ? דִּכְתִיב: ״וְהַבַּיִת בְּהִבָּנוֹתוֹ אֶבֶן שְׁלֵמָה מַסָּע נִבְנָה וְגוֹ׳״ – אָמַר לְהוּ לְרַבָּנַן: הֵיכִי אֶעֱבֵיד? אֲמַרוּ לֵיהּ: אִיכָּא שָׁמִירָא דְּאַיְיתִי מֹשֶׁה לְאַבְנֵי אֵפוֹד.

The Master said: Here they interpreted it: Male demons and female demons. The Gemara asks: Why was it necessary for Solomon, the author of Ecclesiastes, to have male demons and female demons? The Gemara answers: As it is written with regard to the building of the Temple: “For the house, when it was being built, was built of stone made ready at the quarry; and there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was being built” (I Kings 6:7). Solomon said to the sages: How shall I make it so that the stone will be precisely cut without using iron? They said to him: There is a creature called a shamir that can cut the stones, which Moses brought and used to cut the stones of the ephod.

Solomon said to them: Where is it found? They said to him: Bring a male demon and a female demon and torment them together. It is possible that they know where, and due to the suffering they will reveal the place to you. Solomon brought a male demon and a female demon and tormented them together, and they said: We do not know where to find the shamir. Perhaps Ashmedai, king of the demons, knows.

Solomon said to them: Where is Ashmedai? They said to him: He is on such-and-such a mountain. He has dug a pit for himself there, and filled it with water, and covered it with a rock, and sealed it with his seal. And every day he ascends to Heaven and studies in the heavenly study hall and he descends to the earth and studies in the earthly study hall. And he comes and checks his seal to ensure that nobody has entered his pit, and then he uncovers it and drinks from the water in the pit. And then he covers it and seals it again and goes.

Solomon sent for Benayahu, son of Jehoiada, a member of the royal entourage, and gave him a chain onto which a sacred name of God was carved, and a ring onto which a sacred name of God was carved, and fleeces of wool and wineskins of wine. What did Benayahu do? He went and dug a pit lower down the mountain, below the pit dug by Ashmedai, drained the water, and plugged it with the fleeces of wool so that Ashmedai’s pit was emptied. And he dug a pit higher up the mountain, above Ashmedai’s pit.
And he poured the wine into it so that the wine filled Ashmedai’s pit, and he plugged the lower and upper pits that he dug. He climbed up and sat in a tree.

When Ashmedai came he checked his seal, opened the pit, and found it to be filled with wine. He said that it is written: “Wine is a mocker, strong drink is riotous; and whosoever wallows in it is not wise” (Proverbs 20:1), and it is written: “Harlotry, wine, and new wine take away the heart” (Hosea 4:11). He concluded: I will not drink this wine. Eventually, when he became thirsty, he was unable to resist the wine and he drank, became intoxicated, and fell asleep.

Benayahu descended from the tree, came, and threw the chain around Ashmedai, and enclosed him within it. When Ashmedai awoke he struggled to remove the chain. Benayahu said to him: The name of your Master is upon you, the name of your Master is upon you, do not tear the chain. God’s name is written on this chain, and it is forbidden to destroy it.

Ashmedai saw a blind man who was lost on the road and he brought him to the correct road. He saw a drunk who was lost on the road and he brought him to the correct road. He saw the joy of a wedding celebration in which they were celebrating, and he cried. He heard a certain man say to a shoemaker [ushkafa]: Make me shoes that will last for seven years, and he laughed. He saw a certain sorcerer performing magic, and he laughed.

כִּי מְטָא לְהָתָם, לָא עַיְּילוּהּ לְגַבֵּיהּ דִּשְׁלֹמֹה עַד תְּלָתָא יוֹמֵי. יוֹמָא קַמָּא אֲמַר לְהוּ: אַמַּאי לָא קָא בָעֵי לִי מַלְכָּא לְגַבֵּיהּ? אֲמַרוּ לֵיהּ: אַנְסֵיהּ מִישְׁתְּיָא. שְׁקַל לְבֵינְתָּא אוֹתֵיב אַחֲבִרְתַּהּ. אֲתוֹ אֲמַרוּ לֵיהּ לִשְׁלֹמֹה. אָמַר לְהוּ, הָכִי אָמַר לְכוּ: הֲדוּר אַשְׁקְיוּהּ.

When Ashmedai arrived there, in Jerusalem, they did not bring him before Solomon until three days had passed. On the first day he said to them: Why doesn’t the king want me to come to him? They said to him: He drank too much and was overcome by drink. Ashmedai took a brick and placed it on top of another brick. The servants came and told Solomon what he had done. Solomon interpreted the action and said to them: This is what he said to you through this allusion: Return and give the king more to drink.

לִמְחַר אֲמַר לְהוּ: וְאַמַּאי לָא קָא בָּעֵי לִי מַלְכָּא לְגַבֵּיהּ? אֲמַרוּ לֵיהּ: אַנְסֵיהּ מֵיכְלָא. שְׁקַל לְבֵינְתָּא מֵחֲבִרְתַּהּ, אוֹתְבַהּ אַאַרְעָא. אֲתוֹ אֲמַרוּ לֵיהּ לִשְׁלֹמֹה. אֲמַר לְהוּ, הָכִי אָמַר לְכוּ: נְגִידוּ מִינֵּיהּ מֵיכְלֵיהּ.

The following day Ashmedai said to them: And why doesn’t the king want me to come to him? They said to him: He ate too much and was overcome by food. Ashmedai took the brick off the other brick and placed it on the ground. The servants came and told Solomon what Ashmedai had done. He interpreted Ashmedai’s actions and said to them: This is what he said to you through this allusion: Take his food away from him.

לְסוֹף תְּלָתָא יוֹמֵי עֲיַיל לְקַמֵּיהּ. שְׁקַל קַנְיָא, וּמְשַׁח אַרְבְּעָה גַּרְמִידֵי, וּשְׁדָא קַמֵּיהּ. אֲמַר לֵיהּ: מִכְּדִי כִּי מָיֵית הָהוּא גַּבְרָא, לֵית לֵיהּ בְּהָדֵין עָלְמָא אֶלָּא אַרְבָּעָה גַּרְמִידֵי; הַשְׁתָּא כְּבַשְׁתֵּיהּ לְכוּלֵּי עָלְמָא, וְלָא שְׂבַעְתְּ עַד דִּכְבַשְׁתְּ נָמֵי לְדִידִי?!

At the end of three days Ashmedai came before Solomon. Ashmedai took a reed and measured four cubits [garmidei], and threw it before him. He said to Solomon: See, when that man, Solomon, dies, he will have nothing in this world except the four cubits of his grave. Now you have conquered the entire world and yet you are not satisfied until you also conquer me?

אֲמַר לֵיהּ: לָא קָא בָעֵינָא מִינָּךְ מִידֵּי; בָּעֵינָא דְּאֶיבְנְיֵיהּ לְבֵית הַמִּקְדָּשׁ, וְקָא מִיבְּעֵי לִי שָׁמִירָא. אֲמַר לֵיהּ: לְדִידִי לָא מְסִיר לִי, לְשָׂרָא דְיַמָּא מָסֵיר לֵיהּ; וְלָא יָהֵיב לֵיהּ אֶלָּא לְתַרְנְגוֹלָא בָּרָא, דִּמְהֵימַן לֵיהּ אַשְּׁבוּעֲתֵיהּ.

Solomon said to him: I need nothing from you. I want to build the Temple and I need the shamir for this. Ashmedai said to him: The shamir was not given to me, but it was given to the angelic minister of the sea. And he gives it only to the wild rooster, also known as the dukhifat or the hoopoe, whom he trusts by the force of his oath to return it.
##### 7
וּמַאי עָבֵד בֵּיהּ? מַמְטֵי לֵיהּ לְטוּרֵי דְּלֵית בְּהוּ יִשּׁוּב, וּמַנַּח לֵהּ אַשִּׁינָּא דְטוּרָא, וּפָקַע טוּרָא; וּמְנַקֵּיט מַיְיתִי בִּיזְרָנֵי מֵאִילָנֵי, וְשָׁדֵי הָתָם, וְהָוֵי יִשּׁוּב. וְהַיְינוּ דִּמְתַרְגְּמִינַן: ״נַגָּר טוּרָא״.

And what does the wild rooster do with it? He brings it to mountains that are not fit for habitation, and he places the shamir on the craggy rock and the mountain splits. And he takes and brings seeds of trees, throws them there, and it becomes fit for habitation. And this is why we interpret the word dukhifat as a cutter of mountains [naggar tura], i.e., the Aramaic translation of the word dukhifat in the Bible is naggar tura, cutter of mountains.

בְּדַקוּ קִינָּא דְּתַרְנְגוֹלָא בָּרָא דְּאִית לֵיהּ בְּנֵי, וְחַפְּיוּהּ לְקִינֵּיהּ זוּגִּיתָא חִיוָּרְתִּי. כִּי אֲתָא, בָּעֵי לְמֵיעַל וְלָא מָצֵי. אֲזַל אַיְיתִי שָׁמִירָא, וְאוֹתְבֵיהּ עִלָּוֵיהּ. רְמָא בֵּיהּ קָלָא, שַׁדְיֵיהּ, שַׁקְלֵיהּ. אֲזַל חֲנַק נַפְשֵׁיהּ אַשְּׁבוּעֲתֵיהּ.

They investigated and found the nest of a wild rooster in which there were chicks, and he covered its nest with translucent glass. When the rooster came it wanted to enter the nest but was unable to do so. It went and brought the shamir and placed it on top to crack the glass. Solomon’s servant threw a clump of dirt at the rooster and the rooster knocked over the shamir. The man took it and the wild rooster went and strangled itself over the fact that it had not kept its oath, by not returning the shamir.

אֲמַר לֵיהּ בְּנָיָהוּ: מַאי טַעְמָא כִּי חֲזִיתֵיהּ לְהָהוּא סַמְיָא דַּהֲוָה קָא טָעֵי בְּאוֹרְחָא, אַסֵּיקְתֵּיהּ לְאוֹרְחֵיהּ? אֲמַר לֵיהּ: מַכְרְזִי עֲלֵיהּ בִּרְקִיעָא דְּצַדִּיק גָּמוּר הוּא, וּמַאן דַּעֲבַד לֵיהּ נִיחָא נַפְשֵׁיהּ, זָכֵי לְעָלְמָא דְּאָתֵי.

Later, Benayahu said to Ashmedai: What is the reason that when you saw that blind man who was lost on the road you brought him to the correct road? Ashmedai said to him: They proclaim about him in heaven that he is a completely righteous man, and anyone who does good for his soul shall merit to enter the World-to-Come.
##### 10
וּמַאי טַעְמָא כִּי חֲזֵיתֵיהּ לְהָהוּא רַוְיָא דְּקָטָעֵי בְּאוֹרְחָא, אַסֵּיקְתֵּיהּ לְאוֹרְחֵיהּ? אֲמַר לֵיהּ: מַכְרְזִי עֲלֵיהּ בִּרְקִיעָא דְּרָשָׁע גָּמוּר הוּא, וְעָבְדִי לֵיהּ נִיחָא נַפְשֵׁיהּ כִּי הֵיכִי דְּלֵיכְלֵיהּ לְעָלְמָא.

Then Benayahu asked: And what is the reason that when you saw the drunk man who was lost on the road you brought him to the correct road? Ashmedai said to him: They proclaim about him in heaven that he is a completely wicked man. And I did good for his soul so that he will consume his reward in this world and not have any reward in the World-to-Come.
##### 11
מַאי טַעְמָא כִּי חֲזֵיתֵיהּ לְהָהוּא חֶדְוְותָא, בְּכֵית? אֲמַר לֵיהּ: בָּעֵי מֵימָת גַּבְרָא בְּגוֹ תְּלָתִין יוֹמִין, וּבָעֲיָא מִינְטָר לְיָבָם קָטָן תְּלֵיסְרֵי שְׁנִין.

Benayahu continued and asked him: What is the reason that when you saw that joy of the wedding you cried? Ashmedai said to him: I knew that this man will die within thirty days. And his wife is required to wait for the yavam, the husband’s brother, who is a minor, to reach the age of thirteen years, the age of majority, so that he can release her through ḥalitza, the ritual through which the yavam frees the yevama of her levirate bonds.
##### 12
מַאי טַעְמָא כִּי שְׁמַעְתֵּיהּ לְהָהוּא גַּבְרָא דַּאֲמַר לֵיהּ לְאוּשְׁכָּפָא: ״עֲבֵיד לִי מְסָאנֵי לְשַׁב שְׁנִין״, אַחֵיכְתְּ? אֲמַר לֵיהּ: הָהוּא, שִׁבְעָה יוֹמֵי לֵית לֵיהּ, מְסָאנֵי לְשַׁב שְׁנִין בָּעֵי?!

In addition, he asked: What is the reason that when you heard that man say to a shoemaker: Make me shoes that will last for seven years, you laughed? Ashmedai said to him: That man does not have seven days to live; does he need shoes that will last for seven years?
##### 13
מַאי טַעְמָא כִּי חֲזֵיתֵיהּ לְהָהוּא קַסָּמָא דַּהֲוָה קָסֵים, אַחֵיכְתְּ? אֲמַר לֵיהּ: דַּהֲוָה יְתֵיב אַבֵּי גַזָּא דְּמַלְכָּא, לִקְסוֹם מַאי דְּאִיכָּא תּוּתֵיהּ!

Benayahu then asked: What is the reason that when you saw that sorcerer performing magic you laughed? Ashmedai said to him: Because he was sitting on the king’s treasury [bei gaza]. Let him use his magic to know what there is buried underneath him.
##### 14
תַּרְחֵיהּ גַּבֵּיהּ עַד דְּבַנְיֵיהּ לְבֵית הַמִּקְדָּשׁ. יוֹמָא חַד הֲוָה קָאֵי לְחוֹדֵיהּ, אֲמַר לֵיהּ: כְּתִיב: ״כְּתוֹעֲפוֹת רְאֵם לוֹ״; וְאָמְרִינַן: ״כְּתוֹעֲפוֹת״ – אֵלּוּ מַלְאֲכֵי הַשָּׁרֵת, ״רְאֵם״ – אֵלּוּ הַשֵּׁדִים. מַאי רְבוּתַיְיכוּ מִינַּן?

Solomon kept Ashmedai with him until he completed building the Temple. One day he stood with Ashmedai alone. He said to Ashmedai: It is written: “For him like the lofty horns of the wild ox” [(Numbers 24:8)](bbl.tor.md#num#c24#8), and the Sages say in explanation of the verse: “Like the lofty horns”; these are the ministering angels. “The wild ox”; these are the demons. In what way are you greater than us? Why does the verse praise your abilities and powers over those of human beings?
##### 15
אֲמַר לֵיהּ: שְׁקוֹל שׁוּשִׁילְתָּא מִינַּאי, וְהַב לִי עִיזְקְתָךְ, וְאַחְוִי לָךְ רְבוּתַאי. שַׁקְלֵיהּ לְשׁוּשִׁילְתָּא מִינֵּיהּ, וְיָהֵיב לֵיהּ עִיזְקְתֵיהּ. בַּלְעֵיהּ, אוֹתְבֵיהּ לְחַד גַּפֵּיהּ בִּרְקִיעָא, וּלְחַד גַּפֵּיהּ בְּאַרְעָא, פַּתְקֵיהּ אַרְבַּע מְאָה פַּרְסֵי. עַל הַהִיא שַׁעְתָּא אֲמַר שְׁלֹמֹה: ״מַה יִּתְרוֹן לָאָדָם בְּכׇל עֲמָלוֹ שֶׁיַּעֲמֹל תַּחַת הַשָּׁמֶשׁ״.

Ashmedai said to him: Take the chain engraved with God’s name off me and give me your ring with God’s name engraved on it, and I will show you my strength. Solomon took the chain off him and he gave him his ring. Ashmedai swallowed the ring and grew until he placed one wing in the heaven and one wing on the earth. He threw Solomon a distance of four hundred parasangs. With regard to that moment Solomon said: “What profit is there for a person through all of his toil under the sun?” [(Ecclesiastes 1:3)](bbl.poetry#eccl#c1#3). With Solomon deposed from the throne, Ashmedai took his place.
##### 16
״וְזֶה הָיָה חֶלְקִי מִכׇּל עֲמָלִי״ – מַאי ״וְזֶה״? רַב וּשְׁמוּאֵל; חַד אָמַר: מַקְלוֹ; וְחַד אָמַר: גּוּנְדּוֹ. הָיָה מְחַזֵּר עַל הַפְּתָחִים, כֹּל הֵיכָא דִּמְטָא, אָמַר: ״אֲנִי קֹהֶלֶת הָיִיתִי מֶלֶךְ עַל יִשְׂרָאֵל בִּירוּשָׁלִָים״. כִּי מְטָא גַּבֵּי סַנְהֶדְרִין, אֲמַרוּ רַבָּנַן: מִכְּדִי שׁוֹטֶה – בַּחֲדָא מִילְּתָא לָא סְרִיךְ, מַאי הַאי?

With regard to the verse: “And this was my portion from all of my toil” [(Ecclesiastes 2:10)](bbl.poetry##c2#10), the Gemara asks: What is the meaning of the expression: “And this”? This expression is always an allusion to an item that is actually in his hand or can be shown. Rav and Shmuel disagree with regard to the meaning of this phrase. One said: This is referring to Solomon’s staff that remained in his hand. And one said: This is referring to his cloak. Solomon circulated from door to door collecting charity, and wherever he arrived he would say: “I, Ecclesiastes, was king over Israel in Jerusalem” [(Ecclesiastes 1:12)](bbl.poetry#eccl#c1#12). When he finally arrived at the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem the sages said: Now, an imbecile does not fixate on one matter all of the time, so what is this matter? Is this man perhaps telling the truth that he is Solomon?
##### 17
אֲמַרוּ לֵיהּ לִבְנָיָהוּ: קָא בָעֵי לָךְ מַלְכָּא לְגַבֵּיהּ? אֲמַר לְהוּ: לָא. שְׁלַחוּ לְהוּ לְמַלְכְּווֹתָא: קָאָתֵי מַלְכָּא לְגַבַּיְיכוּ? שְׁלַחוּ לְהוּ: אִין, קָאָתֵי. שְׁלַחוּ לְהוּ: בִּידְקוּ בְּכַרְעֵיהּ. שְׁלַחוּ לְהוּ: בְּמוּקֵי קָאָתֵי;

The sages said to Benayahu: Does the king require you to be with him? Benayahu said to them: No. They sent to the queens and asked: Does the king come to be with you? The queens sent a response to them: Yes, he comes. They sent a request to the queens: Check his feet to see if they are human feet. The queens sent a response to the sages: He always comes in socks [bemokei], and it is not possible to see his feet.
##### 18
וְקָא תָבַע לְהוּ בְּנִידּוּתַיְיהוּ; וְקָא תָבַע לַהּ נָמֵי לְבַת שֶׁבַע אִימֵּיהּ. אַתְיוּהּ לִשְׁלֹמֹה, וְהַבוּ לֵיהּ עִזְקְתָא, וְשׁוּשִׁילְתָּא דַּחֲקִוק עָלֶיהָ שֵׁם. כִּי עָיֵיל, חַזְיֵיהּ, פְּרַח.

The queens continued discussing the king’s behavior: And he demands of them, i.e., the queens, to engage in sexual intercourse when they are menstruating. And he also demands that Bathsheba his mother engage in sexual intercourse with him. Once the Sanhedrin heard this they understood that this was an imposter and not actually Solomon. They brought Solomon, gave him a ring and the chain on which the name of God was carved. When Solomon entered, Ashmedai saw him and fled.
##### 19
וַאֲפִילּוּ הָכִי, הֲוָה לֵיהּ בִּיעֲתוּתָא מִינֵּיהּ. וְהַיְינוּ דִּכְתִיב: ״הִנֵּה מִטָּתוֹ שֶׁלִּשְׁלֹמֹה שִׁשִּׁים גִּבּוֹרִים סָבִיב לָהּ מִגִּבּוֹרֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל, כּוּלָּם אֲחוּזֵי חֶרֶב מְלוּמְּדֵי מִלְחָמָה, אִישׁ חַרְבּוֹ עַל יְרֵיכוֹ מִפַּחַד בַּלֵּילוֹת״.

The Gemara adds: And even so, although Ashmedai fled, Solomon was fearful of him, and this is as it is written: “Behold the bed of Solomon surrounded by sixty strong men from the warriors of Israel. All of them holding swords and trained in war, each man with his sword on his thigh from fear in the nights” (Song of Songs 3:7–8).
##### 20
רַב וּשְׁמוּאֵל, חַד אָמַר: מֶלֶךְ וְהֶדְיוֹט, וְחַד אָמַר: מֶלֶךְ וְהֶדְיוֹט וּמֶלֶךְ.

Rav and Shmuel disagreed with regard to this story of Solomon. One said: He was a king and afterward he became a commoner, and never returned to his position as king. And one said: He was a king, and became a commoner, and a king, as ultimately he returned to his throne and defeated Ashmedai.

Rabbi Yoḥanan bar Ḥanina says: Daytime is twelve hours long, and the day Adam the first man was created was divided as follows: In the first hour of the day, his dust was gathered. In the second, an undefined figure was fashioned. In the third, his limbs were extended. In the fourth, a soul was cast into him. In the fifth, he stood on his legs. In the sixth, he called the creatures by the names he gave them. In the seventh, Eve was paired with him. In the eighth, they arose to the bed two, and descended four, i.e., Cain and Abel were immediately born. In the ninth, he was commanded not to eat of the Tree of Knowledge. In the tenth, he sinned. In the eleventh, he was judged. In the twelfth, he was expelled and left the Garden of Eden, as it is stated: “But man abides not in honor; he is like the beasts that perish” (Psalms 49:13). Adam did not abide, i.e., sleep, in a place of honor for even one night.

(שָׁעָה, בַּסּוֹף, אֲרַמִּי – סִימָן.) 

The Gemara presents a mnemonic for the statements that follow: At the time, to the end, Aramaic. 

אָמַר רַב יְהוּדָה אָמַר רַב: בְּשָׁעָה שֶׁבִּקֵּשׁ הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא לִבְראוֹת אֶת הָאָדָם, בָּרָא כַּת אַחַת שֶׁל מַלְאֲכֵי הַשָּׁרֵת. 

Rav Yehuda says that Rav says: At the time that the Holy One, Blessed be He, sought to create a person, He created one group of ministering angels. 

אָמַר לָהֶם: רְצוֹנְכֶם נַעֲשֶׂה אָדָם בְּצַלְמֵנוּ? 

He said to them: If you agree, let us fashion a person in our image. 

אָמְרוּ לְפָנָיו: רִבּוֹנוֹ שֶׁל עוֹלָם, מָה מַעֲשָׂיו? 

The angels said before him: Master of the Universe, what are the actions of this person You suggest to create? 

אָמַר לָהֶן: כָּךְ וְכָךְ מַעֲשָׂיו.

God said to them: His actions are such and such, according to human nature.
##### 5
אָמְרוּ לְפָנָיו: רִבּוֹנוֹ שֶׁל עוֹלָם, ״מָה אֱנוֹשׁ כִּי תִזְכְּרֶנּוּ וּבֶן אָדָם כִּי תִפְקְדֶנּוּ״? 

The angels said before him: Master of the Universe: “What is man that You are mindful of him? And the son of man that You think of him?” (Psalms 8:5), i.e., a creature such as this is not worth creating. 

הוֹשִׁיט אֶצְבָּעוֹ קְטַנָּה בֵּינֵיהֶן וּשְׂרָפָם. 

God outstretched His small finger among them and burned them with fire. 

וְכֵן כַּת שְׁנִיָּה. 

And the same occurred with a second group of angels. 

כַּת שְׁלִישִׁית אָמְרוּ לְפָנָיו: רִבּוֹנוֹ שֶׁל עוֹלָם, רִאשׁוֹנִים שֶׁאָמְרוּ לְפָנֶיךָ מָה הוֹעִילוּ? 

The third group of angels that He asked said before Him: Master of the Universe, the first two groups who spoke their mind before You, what did they accomplish? 

כָּל הָעוֹלָם כּוּלּוֹ שֶׁלְּךָ הוּא. כׇּל מָה שֶׁאַתָּה רוֹצֶה לַעֲשׂוֹת בְּעוֹלָמְךָ – עֲשֵׂה.

The entire world is Yours; whatever You wish to do in Your world, do. God then created the first person.

When history arrived at the time of the people of the generation of the flood and the people of the generation of the dispersion, i.e., the Tower of Babel, whose actions were ruinous, the angels said before God: 

רִבּוֹנוֹ שֶׁל עוֹלָם, לֹא יָפֶה אָמְרוּ רִאשׁוֹנִים לְפָנֶיךָ? 

Master of the Universe, didn’t the first set of angels speak appropriately before You, that human beings are not worthy of having been created? 

אָמַר לָהֶן: ״וְעַד זִקְנָה אֲנִי הוּא וְעַד שֵׂיבָה אֲנִי אֶסְבֹּל וְגוֹ׳״.

God said to them concerning humanity: “Even to your old age I am the same; and even to hoar hairs will I suffer you; I have made and I will bear; and I will carry, and I will deliver you” (Isaiah 46:4), i.e., having created people, I will even suffer their flaws.

(קהלת ה, יב) עושר שמור לבעליו לרעתו אמר ר"ל זה עושרו של קרח (דברים יא, ו) ואת כל היקום אשר ברגליהם א"ר אלעזר זה ממונו של אדם שמעמידו על רגליו 

With regard to the verse: “Wealth is kept for the owner to his detriment” (Ecclesiastes 5:12), Reish Lakish says: This is referring to the wealth of Korah, which was of no use to him. The fact that Korah was wealthy is derived from the verse: “And all the substance that was at their feet” (Deuteronomy 11:6), as Rabbi Elazar says: This is referring to a person’s property, which stands him on his feet. 

ואמר רבי לוי משוי ג' מאות פרדות לבנות היו מפתחות של בית גנזיו של קרח וכולהו אקלידי וקילפי דגילדא

And Rabbi Levi says: The keys alone to Korah’s treasury were a burden requiring three hundred white mules to transport them, and moreover, all the keys [aklidei] and locks were of leather. This conveys the vastness of his wealth.

Rav Ḥaviva said: Rav Ḥaviva bar Surmakei told me: I once saw one of the Sages whom Elijah the prophet would visit, and his eyes looked beautiful and healthy in the morning, but appeared to be charred by fire in the evening. 

אֲמַרִי לֵיהּ: מַאי הַאי? 

I said to him: What is this phenomenon? 

וַאֲמַר לִי: דַּאֲמַרִי לֵיהּ לְאֵלִיָּהוּ: אַחְוִי לִי רַבָּנַן כִּי סָלְקִי לִמְתִיבְתָּא דְּרָקִיעַ. 

And he said to me: I said to Elijah: Show me the Sages upon their ascension to the heavenly academy. 

אָמַר לִי: בְּכוּלְּהוּ מָצֵית אִסְתַּכּוֹלֵי בְּהוּ, לְבַר מִגּוּהַרְקָא דְּרַבִּי חִיָּיא דְּלָא תִּסְתַּכֵּל בֵּיהּ. 

Elijah said to me: You may gaze at all of them except for those in the chariot [miguharka] of Rabbi Ḥiyya, upon whom you may not gaze. 

מַאי סִימָנַיְיהוּ? 

I asked Elijah: What are the signs of Rabbi Ḥiyya’s chariot, so I will know when not to look? 

בְּכוּלְּהוּ אָזְלִי מַלְאֲכֵי כִּי סָלְקִי וְנָחֲתִי, לְבַר מִגּוּהַרְקָא דְּרַבִּי חִיָּיא דְּמִנַּפְשֵׁיהּ סָלֵיק וּנְחֵית.

He said: Angels accompany all of the other Sages’ chariots as they ascend and descend, except for the chariot of Rabbi Ḥiyya, which ascends and descends of its own accord, due to his greatness.

אָמְרִי בִּרְקִיעָא: מַאן גַּלִּי רָזַיָּא בְּעָלְמָא? 

They said in heaven: Who is the revealer of secrets in the world? 

אָמְרִי: אֵלִיָּהוּ. 

They said in response: It is Elijah. 

אַתְיוּהּ לְאֵלִיָּהוּ מַחְיוּהּ שִׁתִּין פּוּלְסֵי דְנוּרָא. 

Elijah was brought to heaven, whereupon he was beaten with sixty fiery lashes. 

אֲתָא אִידְּמִי לְהוּ כְּדוּבָּא דְנוּרָא, 

Elijah came back down to earth disguised as a bear of fire. 

עָל בֵּינַיְיהוּ וְטַרְדִינְהוּ.

He came among the congregation and distracted them from their prayers, preventing Rabbi Ḥiyya from reciting the phrase: Who revives the dead.

וּלְמָה לִי תְּלָתָא? תִּסְגֵּי בְּחַד. 

The Gemara asks: And why do I need three calves? One calf should be sufficient for three guests. 

אָמַר רַב חָנָן בַּר רָבָא: כְּדֵי לְהַאֲכִילָן שָׁלֹשׁ לְשׁוֹנוֹת בְּחַרְדָּל. 

Rav Ḥanan bar Rava said: Abraham prepared three calves in order to feed the guests three tongues with mustard, a particular delicacy. 

אָמַר רַבִּי תַּנְחוּם בַּר חֲנִילַאי: לְעוֹלָם אַל יְשַׁנֶּה אָדָם מִן הַמִּנְהָג, שֶׁהֲרֵי מֹשֶׁה עָלָה לַמָּרוֹם וְלֹא אָכַל לֶחֶם, מַלְאֲכֵי הַשָּׁרֵת יָרְדוּ לְמַטָּה וְאָכְלוּ לֶחֶם. 

With regard to this incident, Rabbi Tanḥum bar Ḥanilai says: A person should never deviate from the local custom, as Moses ascended to heaven on high and did not eat bread while he was there, whereas the ministering angels descended down to this world, as guests visiting Abraham, and they ate bread. 

וְאָכְלוּ סָלְקָא דַּעְתָּךְ?! 
You say: And they ate bread? Can it enter your mind that they actually ate food? 

אֶלָּא אֵימָא: נִרְאוּ כְּמִי שֶׁאָכְלוּ וְשָׁתוּ.

Rather, say that they merely appeared as though they ate and drank.

״יֻקַּח נָא מְעַט מַיִם וְרַחֲצוּ רַגְלֵיכֶם״, 

The Gemara continues its analysis of the verse: “Let now a little water be fetched and wash your feet” (Genesis 18:4). 

אָמַר רַבִּי יַנַּאי בְּרַבִּי יִשְׁמָעֵאל, אָמְרוּ לוֹ: וְכִי בְּעַרְבִיִּים חֲשַׁדְתָּנוּ, שֶׁהֵם מִשְׁתַּחֲוִים לַאֲבַק רַגְלֵיהֶם, כְּבָר יָצָא מִמֶּנּוּ יִשְׁמָעֵאל.

Rabbi Yannai, son of Rabbi Yishmael, said that the guests said to Abraham: Are you suspicious that we are Arabs who bow to the dust of their feet? Yishmael has already issued from him, i.e., your own son acts in this manner.

אמר רב חנן בר רב חסדא אמר רב ואמרי לה א"ר חנן בר רבא אמר רב חמשה בתי עבודת כוכבים קבועין הן אלו הן בית בל בבבל בית נבו בכורסי תרעתא שבמפג צריפא שבאשקלון נשרא שבערביא 

§ Rav Ḥanan bar Rav Ḥisda says that Rav says, and some say that it was Rav Ḥanan bar Rava who says that Rav says: There are five established temples of idol worship, and they are: The temple of Bel in Babylonia; the temple of Nebo in the city of Khursei; the temple of Tirata, which is located in the city of Mapag; Tzerifa, which is located in Ashkelon; and Nashra, which is located in Arabia. 

כי אתא רב דימי הוסיפו עליהן יריד שבעין בכי נדבכה שבעכו איכא דאמרי נתברא שבעכו רב דימי מנהרדעא מתני איפכא יריד שבעכו נדבכה שבעין בכי

When Rav Dimi came from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said: The Sages added to these places the marketplace that is located in Ein Bekhi and Nadbekha, which is located in Akko. There are those who say that Rav Dimi was referring to Natbera that is located in Akko. Rav Dimi from Neharde’a teaches the opposite, that it is the marketplace that is located in Akko, and Nadbekha that is located in Ein Bekhi.
