תַּנְיָא, אַבָּא בִּנְיָמִין אוֹמֵר: אִלְמָלֵי נִתְּנָה רְשׁוּת לָעַיִן לִרְאוֹת — אֵין כׇּל בְּרִיָּה יְכוֹלָה לַעֲמוֹד מִפְּנֵי הַמַּזִּיקִין. 
In another baraita it was taught that Abba Binyamin says: If the eye was given permission to see, no creature would be able to withstand the abundance and ubiquity of the demons and continue to live unaffected by them.

תָּנוּ רַבָּנַן, שִׁשָּׁה דְּבָרִים נֶאֶמְרוּ בַּשֵּׁדִים: שְׁלֹשָׁה כְּמַלְאֲכֵי הַשָּׁרֵת, וּשְׁלֹשָׁה כִּבְנֵי אָדָם. שְׁלֹשָׁה כְּמַלְאֲכֵי הַשָּׁרֵת — יֵשׁ לָהֶם כְּנָפַיִם כְּמַלְאֲכֵי הַשָּׁרֵת, וְטָסִין מִסּוֹף הָעוֹלָם וְעַד סוֹפוֹ כְּמַלְאֲכֵי הַשָּׁרֵת, וְיוֹדְעִין מַה שֶּׁעָתִיד לִהְיוֹת כְּמַלְאֲכֵי הַשָּׁרֵת.

The Gemara returns to discussing the heavenly beings. The Sages taught: Six statements were said with regard to demons: In three ways they are like ministering angels, and in three ways they are like humans. The baraita specifies: In three ways they are like ministering angels: They have wings like ministering angels; and they fly from one end of the world to the other like ministering angels; and they know what will be in the future like ministering angels.
#### 6
יוֹדְעִין סָלְקָא דַּעְתָּךְ?! אֶלָּא, שׁוֹמְעִין מֵאֲחוֹרֵי הַפַּרְגּוֹד, כְּמַלְאֲכֵי הַשָּׁרֵת.
The Gemara is puzzled by this last statement: Should it enter your mind that they know this? Not even the angels are privy to the future. Rather, they hear from behind the curtain when God reveals something of the future, like ministering angels.

וּשְׁלֹשָׁה כִּבְנֵי אָדָם — אוֹכְלִין וְשׁוֹתִין כִּבְנֵי אָדָם, פָּרִין וְרָבִין כִּבְנֵי אָדָם, וּמֵתִים כִּבְנֵי אָדָם.
And in three ways they are similar to humans: They eat and drink like humans; they multiply like humans; and they die like humans.

״וַתֹּאמֶר אֲחוֹתוֹ אֶל בַּת פַּרְעֹה הַאֵלֵךְ וְקָרָאתִי לָךְ אִשָּׁה מֵינֶקֶת מִן הָעִבְרִיּוֹת״. וּמַאי שְׁנָא מֵעִבְרִיּוֹת?

The Gemara now discusses the next verse in Exodus: “Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter: Shall I go and call you a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for you?” (Exodus 2:7). The Gemara asks: And what is different that Pharaoh’s daughter would specifically want a nurse of the Hebrew women?
### 12b.20
מְלַמֵּד שֶׁהֶחְזִירוּהוּ לְמֹשֶׁה עַל כׇּל הַמִּצְרִיּוֹת כּוּלָּן, וְלֹא יָנַק, אָמַר: פֶּה שֶׁעָתִיד לְדַבֵּר עִם הַשְּׁכִינָה יִינַק דָּבָר טָמֵא? וְהַיְינוּ דִּכְתִיב: ״אֶת מִי יוֹרֶה דֵעָה וְגוֹ׳״. לְמִי יוֹרֶה דֵּעָה וּלְמִי יָבִין שְׁמוּעָה — ״לִגְמוּלֵי מֵחָלָב וּלְעַתִּיקֵי מִשָּׁדַיִם״.

The Gemara answers: This teaches that prior to this, they took Moses around to all the Egyptian wet nurses and he did not agree to nurse from any of them, as he said: Shall a mouth that in the future will speak with the Divine Presence actually nurse something impure? And this is as it is written: “Whom shall one teach knowledge? And whom shall one make understand the message?” (Isaiah 28:9). The prophet is asking: To whom shall God teach the knowledge of the Torah, and to whom shall God make to understand the message of the Torah? The answer is as the verse continues: “Them that are weaned from the milk, them that are drawn from the breasts” (Isaiah 28:9). The conclusion of the verse

״עָשִׂיתִי לִי שָׁרִים וְשָׁרוֹת וְתַעֲנוּגוֹת בְּנֵי הָאָדָם, שִׁדָּה וְשִׁדּוֹת״; ״שָׁרִים וְשָׁרוֹת״ – אֵלּוּ מִינֵי זֶמֶר, ״וְתַעֲנוּגוֹת בְּנֵי הָאָדָם״ – אֵלּוּ בְּרֵיכוֹת וּמֶרְחֲצָאוֹת, ״שִׁדָּה וְשִׁדּוֹת״ – הָכָא תַּרְגִּימוּ: שֵׁידָה וְשֵׁידְתִין. בְּמַעְרְבָא אָמְרִי: שִׁידְּתָא.

After mentioning the spirit named kordeyakos on the previous daf the Gemara relates other matters connected to spirits and demons. It is written: “I got myself sharim and sharot, and human pleasures, shidda and shiddot” [(Ecclesiastes 2:8)](bbl.poetry#eccl#c2#8).

The Gemara explains: “Sharim and sharot”: These are types of musical instruments. “And human pleasures”: These are pools and bathhouses. “Shidda and shiddot”: Here, in Babylonia, they interpreted these words in the following manner: Male demons [shidda] and female demons [shiddetin]. In the West, Eretz Yisrael, they said that these words are referring to carriages [shiddeta].

אָמַר מָר, הָכָא תַּרְגִּימוּ: שֵׁידָא וְשֵׁידְתִין. שֵׁידָה וְשֵׁידְתִין – לְמַאי אִיבְּעִי לֵיהּ? דִּכְתִיב: ״וְהַבַּיִת בְּהִבָּנוֹתוֹ אֶבֶן שְׁלֵמָה מַסָּע נִבְנָה וְגוֹ׳״ – אָמַר לְהוּ לְרַבָּנַן: הֵיכִי אֶעֱבֵיד? אֲמַרוּ לֵיהּ: אִיכָּא שָׁמִירָא דְּאַיְיתִי מֹשֶׁה לְאַבְנֵי אֵפוֹד.

The Master said: Here they interpreted it: Male demons and female demons. The Gemara asks: Why was it necessary for Solomon, the author of Ecclesiastes, to have male demons and female demons? The Gemara answers: As it is written with regard to the building of the Temple: “For the house, when it was being built, was built of stone made ready at the quarry; and there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was being built” (I Kings 6:7). Solomon said to the sages: How shall I make it so that the stone will be precisely cut without using iron? They said to him: There is a creature called a shamir that can cut the stones, which Moses brought and used to cut the stones of the ephod.

אֲמַר לְהוּ: הֵיכָא אִישְׁתְּכַח? אֲמַרוּ לֵיהּ: אַיְיתִי שֵׁידָה וְשֵׁידְתִין כַּבְשִׁינְהוּ אַהֲדָדֵי, אֶפְשָׁר דְּיָדְעִי וּמְגַלּוּ לָךְ. אַיְיתִי שֵׁידָה וְשֵׁידְתִין כַּבְשִׁינְהוּ אַהֲדָדֵי, אָמְרִי: אֲנַן לָא יָדְעִינַן, דִּילְמָא אַשְׁמְדַאי – מַלְכָּא דְשֵׁידֵי, יָדַע.

Solomon said to them: Where is it found? They said to him: Bring a male demon and a female demon and torment them together. It is possible that they know where, and due to the suffering they will reveal the place to you. Solomon brought a male demon and a female demon and tormented them together, and they said: We do not know where to find the shamir. Perhaps Ashmedai, king of the demons, knows.

אֲמַר לְהוּ: הֵיכָא אִיתֵיהּ? אָמְרִי לֵיהּ: אִיתֵיהּ בְּטוּרָא פְּלָן. כַּרְיָא לֵיהּ בֵּירָא, וּמַלְיָא לֵיהּ מַיָּא, וּמִיכַּסְּיָא בְּטִינָּרָא, וַחֲתִימָה בְּגוּשְׁפַּנְקֵיהּ; וְכֹל יוֹמָא סָלֵיק לִרְקִיעָא וְגָמַר מְתִיבְתָּא דִרְקִיעָא, וְנָחֵית לְאַרְעָא וְגָמַר מְתִיבְתָּא דְאַרְעָא; וְאָתֵי סָיֵיר לֵיהּ לְגוּשְׁפַּנְקֵיהּ וּמְגַלֵּי לֵיהּ וְשָׁתֵי, וּמְכַסֵּי לֵיהּ וְחָתֵים לֵיהּ וְאָזֵיל.

Solomon said to them: Where is Ashmedai? They said to him: He is on such-and-such a mountain. He has dug a pit for himself there, and filled it with water, and covered it with a rock, and sealed it with his seal. And every day he ascends to Heaven and studies in the heavenly study hall and he descends to the earth and studies in the earthly study hall. And he comes and checks his seal to ensure that nobody has entered his pit, and then he uncovers it and drinks from the water in the pit. And then he covers it and seals it again and goes.

Solomon sent for Benayahu, son of Jehoiada, a member of the royal entourage, and gave him a chain onto which a sacred name of God was carved, and a ring onto which a sacred name of God was carved, and fleeces of wool and wineskins of wine. What did Benayahu do? He went and dug a pit lower down the mountain, below the pit dug by Ashmedai, drained the water, and plugged it with the fleeces of wool so that Ashmedai’s pit was emptied. And he dug a pit higher up the mountain, above Ashmedai’s pit.
And he poured the wine into it so that the wine filled Ashmedai’s pit, and he plugged the lower and upper pits that he dug. He climbed up and sat in a tree.

כִּי אֲתָא סַיְירֵיהּ לְגוּשְׁפַּנְקָא, גַּלְּיֵיהּ, אַשְׁכְּחֵיהּ חַמְרָא. אֲמַר: כְּתִיב: ״לֵץ הַיַּיִן הוֹמֶה שֵׁכָר, וְכׇל שׁוֹגֶה בּוֹ לֹא יֶחְכָּם״, וּכְתִיב: ״זְנוּת וְיַיִן וְתִירוֹשׁ יִקַּח לֵב״. לָא אִישְׁתִּי. כִּי צָחֵי, לָא סַגִּיא לֵיהּ; אִישְׁתִּי, רְוָא וּגְנָא.

When Ashmedai came he checked his seal, opened the pit, and found it to be filled with wine. He said that it is written: “Wine is a mocker, strong drink is riotous; and whosoever wallows in it is not wise” (Proverbs 20:1), and it is written: “Harlotry, wine, and new wine take away the heart” (Hosea 4:11). He concluded: I will not drink this wine. Eventually, when he became thirsty, he was unable to resist the wine and he drank, became intoxicated, and fell asleep.

נְחֵית, אֲתָא, שְׁדָא בֵּיהּ שׁוּשִׁילְתָּא, סְתָמֵיהּ. כִּי אִתְּעַר, הֲוָה קָא מִיפַּרְזַל; אֲמַר לֵיהּ: שְׁמָא דְמָרָךְ עֲלָךְ! שְׁמָא דְּמָרָךְ עֲלָךְ!

Benayahu descended from the tree, came, and threw the chain around Ashmedai, and enclosed him within it. When Ashmedai awoke he struggled to remove the chain. Benayahu said to him: The name of your Master is upon you, the name of your Master is upon you, do not tear the chain. God’s name is written on this chain, and it is forbidden to destroy it.

כִּי נָקֵיט לֵיהּ וְאָתֵי, מְטָא דִּיקְלָא – חַף בֵּיהּ, שַׁדְיֵיהּ; מְטָא לְבֵיתָא – שַׁדְיֵיהּ; מְטָא גַּבֵּי כּוּבָּא דְּהָהִיא אַרְמַלְתָּא, נְפַקָא

When Benayahu took Ashmedai and came to Jerusalem he reached a palm tree and Ashmedai rubbed against it and knocked it down. He reached a house and knocked it down. He reached a small shack [kuva] belonging to a certain widow. This widow emerged,

and she begged him not to knock down the house. He bent his body away from her, to the other side, and broke one of his bones. He said: This is as it is written: “Soft speech can break a bone” [(Proverbs 25:15)](bbl.poetry#prov#c25#15).

חֲזָא סַמְיָא דַּהֲוָה קָא טָעֵי בְּאוֹרְחָא, אַסְּקֵיהּ לְאוֹרְחֵיהּ. חֲזָא רַוְיָא דַּהֲוָה קָא טָעֵי בְּאוֹרְחָא, אַסְּקֵיהּ לְאוֹרְחֵיהּ. חֲזָא חֶדְוְותָא דַּהֲווֹ קָמְחַדִּי לַהּ, בְּכָה. שַׁמְעֵיהּ לְהָהוּא גַּבְרָא דַּהֲוָה קָאָמַר לְאוּשְׁכָּפָא: עָבֵיד לִי מְסָאנֵי לְשַׁב שְׁנֵי, אַחֵיךְ. חֲזָא הָהוּא קַסָּמָא דַּהֲוָה קָסֵים, אַחֵיךְ.

Ashmedai saw a blind man who was lost on the road and he brought him to the correct road. He saw a drunk who was lost on the road and he brought him to the correct road. He saw the joy of a wedding celebration in which they were celebrating, and he cried. He heard a certain man say to a shoemaker [ushkafa]: Make me shoes that will last for seven years, and he laughed. He saw a certain sorcerer performing magic, and he laughed.

כִּי מְטָא לְהָתָם, לָא עַיְּילוּהּ לְגַבֵּיהּ דִּשְׁלֹמֹה עַד תְּלָתָא יוֹמֵי. יוֹמָא קַמָּא אֲמַר לְהוּ: אַמַּאי לָא קָא בָעֵי לִי מַלְכָּא לְגַבֵּיהּ? אֲמַרוּ לֵיהּ: אַנְסֵיהּ מִישְׁתְּיָא. שְׁקַל לְבֵינְתָּא אוֹתֵיב אַחֲבִרְתַּהּ. אֲתוֹ אֲמַרוּ לֵיהּ לִשְׁלֹמֹה. אָמַר לְהוּ, הָכִי אָמַר לְכוּ: הֲדוּר אַשְׁקְיוּהּ.

When Ashmedai arrived there, in Jerusalem, they did not bring him before Solomon until three days had passed. On the first day he said to them: Why doesn’t the king want me to come to him? They said to him: He drank too much and was overcome by drink. Ashmedai took a brick and placed it on top of another brick. The servants came and told Solomon what he had done. Solomon interpreted the action and said to them: This is what he said to you through this allusion: Return and give the king more to drink.

לִמְחַר אֲמַר לְהוּ: וְאַמַּאי לָא קָא בָּעֵי לִי מַלְכָּא לְגַבֵּיהּ? אֲמַרוּ לֵיהּ: אַנְסֵיהּ מֵיכְלָא. שְׁקַל לְבֵינְתָּא מֵחֲבִרְתַּהּ, אוֹתְבַהּ אַאַרְעָא. אֲתוֹ אֲמַרוּ לֵיהּ לִשְׁלֹמֹה. אֲמַר לְהוּ, הָכִי אָמַר לְכוּ: נְגִידוּ מִינֵּיהּ מֵיכְלֵיהּ.

The following day Ashmedai said to them: And why doesn’t the king want me to come to him? They said to him: He ate too much and was overcome by food. Ashmedai took the brick off the other brick and placed it on the ground. The servants came and told Solomon what Ashmedai had done. He interpreted Ashmedai’s actions and said to them: This is what he said to you through this allusion: Take his food away from him.

לְסוֹף תְּלָתָא יוֹמֵי עֲיַיל לְקַמֵּיהּ. שְׁקַל קַנְיָא, וּמְשַׁח אַרְבְּעָה גַּרְמִידֵי, וּשְׁדָא קַמֵּיהּ. אֲמַר לֵיהּ: מִכְּדִי כִּי מָיֵית הָהוּא גַּבְרָא, לֵית לֵיהּ בְּהָדֵין עָלְמָא אֶלָּא אַרְבָּעָה גַּרְמִידֵי; הַשְׁתָּא כְּבַשְׁתֵּיהּ לְכוּלֵּי עָלְמָא, וְלָא שְׂבַעְתְּ עַד דִּכְבַשְׁתְּ נָמֵי לְדִידִי?!

At the end of three days Ashmedai came before Solomon. Ashmedai took a reed and measured four cubits [garmidei], and threw it before him. He said to Solomon: See, when that man, Solomon, dies, he will have nothing in this world except the four cubits of his grave. Now you have conquered the entire world and yet you are not satisfied until you also conquer me?
#### 6
אֲמַר לֵיהּ: לָא קָא בָעֵינָא מִינָּךְ מִידֵּי; בָּעֵינָא דְּאֶיבְנְיֵיהּ לְבֵית הַמִּקְדָּשׁ, וְקָא מִיבְּעֵי לִי שָׁמִירָא. אֲמַר לֵיהּ: לְדִידִי לָא מְסִיר לִי, לְשָׂרָא דְיַמָּא מָסֵיר לֵיהּ; וְלָא יָהֵיב לֵיהּ אֶלָּא לְתַרְנְגוֹלָא בָּרָא, דִּמְהֵימַן לֵיהּ אַשְּׁבוּעֲתֵיהּ.

Solomon said to him: I need nothing from you. I want to build the Temple and I need the shamir for this. Ashmedai said to him: The shamir was not given to me, but it was given to the angelic minister of the sea. And he gives it only to the wild rooster, also known as the dukhifat or the hoopoe, whom he trusts by the force of his oath to return it.
#### 7
וּמַאי עָבֵד בֵּיהּ? מַמְטֵי לֵיהּ לְטוּרֵי דְּלֵית בְּהוּ יִשּׁוּב, וּמַנַּח לֵהּ אַשִּׁינָּא דְטוּרָא, וּפָקַע טוּרָא; וּמְנַקֵּיט מַיְיתִי בִּיזְרָנֵי מֵאִילָנֵי, וְשָׁדֵי הָתָם, וְהָוֵי יִשּׁוּב. וְהַיְינוּ דִּמְתַרְגְּמִינַן: ״נַגָּר טוּרָא״.

And what does the wild rooster do with it? He brings it to mountains that are not fit for habitation, and he places the shamir on the craggy rock and the mountain splits. And he takes and brings seeds of trees, throws them there, and it becomes fit for habitation. And this is why we interpret the word dukhifat as a cutter of mountains [naggar tura], i.e., the Aramaic translation of the word dukhifat in the Bible is naggar tura, cutter of mountains.

בְּדַקוּ קִינָּא דְּתַרְנְגוֹלָא בָּרָא דְּאִית לֵיהּ בְּנֵי, וְחַפְּיוּהּ לְקִינֵּיהּ זוּגִּיתָא חִיוָּרְתִּי. כִּי אֲתָא, בָּעֵי לְמֵיעַל וְלָא מָצֵי. אֲזַל אַיְיתִי שָׁמִירָא, וְאוֹתְבֵיהּ עִלָּוֵיהּ. רְמָא בֵּיהּ קָלָא, שַׁדְיֵיהּ, שַׁקְלֵיהּ. אֲזַל חֲנַק נַפְשֵׁיהּ אַשְּׁבוּעֲתֵיהּ.

They investigated and found the nest of a wild rooster in which there were chicks, and he covered its nest with translucent glass. When the rooster came it wanted to enter the nest but was unable to do so. It went and brought the shamir and placed it on top to crack the glass. Solomon’s servant threw a clump of dirt at the rooster and the rooster knocked over the shamir. The man took it and the wild rooster went and strangled itself over the fact that it had not kept its oath, by not returning the shamir.
#### 9
אֲמַר לֵיהּ בְּנָיָהוּ: מַאי טַעְמָא כִּי חֲזִיתֵיהּ לְהָהוּא סַמְיָא דַּהֲוָה קָא טָעֵי בְּאוֹרְחָא, אַסֵּיקְתֵּיהּ לְאוֹרְחֵיהּ? אֲמַר לֵיהּ: מַכְרְזִי עֲלֵיהּ בִּרְקִיעָא דְּצַדִּיק גָּמוּר הוּא, וּמַאן דַּעֲבַד לֵיהּ נִיחָא נַפְשֵׁיהּ, זָכֵי לְעָלְמָא דְּאָתֵי.

Later, Benayahu said to Ashmedai: What is the reason that when you saw that blind man who was lost on the road you brought him to the correct road? Ashmedai said to him: They proclaim about him in heaven that he is a completely righteous man, and anyone who does good for his soul shall merit to enter the World-to-Come.
#### 10
וּמַאי טַעְמָא כִּי חֲזֵיתֵיהּ לְהָהוּא רַוְיָא דְּקָטָעֵי בְּאוֹרְחָא, אַסֵּיקְתֵּיהּ לְאוֹרְחֵיהּ? אֲמַר לֵיהּ: מַכְרְזִי עֲלֵיהּ בִּרְקִיעָא דְּרָשָׁע גָּמוּר הוּא, וְעָבְדִי לֵיהּ נִיחָא נַפְשֵׁיהּ כִּי הֵיכִי דְּלֵיכְלֵיהּ לְעָלְמָא.

Then Benayahu asked: And what is the reason that when you saw the drunk man who was lost on the road you brought him to the correct road? Ashmedai said to him: They proclaim about him in heaven that he is a completely wicked man. And I did good for his soul so that he will consume his reward in this world and not have any reward in the World-to-Come.
#### 11
מַאי טַעְמָא כִּי חֲזֵיתֵיהּ לְהָהוּא חֶדְוְותָא, בְּכֵית? אֲמַר לֵיהּ: בָּעֵי מֵימָת גַּבְרָא בְּגוֹ תְּלָתִין יוֹמִין, וּבָעֲיָא מִינְטָר לְיָבָם קָטָן תְּלֵיסְרֵי שְׁנִין.

Benayahu continued and asked him: What is the reason that when you saw that joy of the wedding you cried? Ashmedai said to him: I knew that this man will die within thirty days. And his wife is required to wait for the yavam, the husband’s brother, who is a minor, to reach the age of thirteen years, the age of majority, so that he can release her through ḥalitza, the ritual through which the yavam frees the yevama of her levirate bonds.
#### 12
מַאי טַעְמָא כִּי שְׁמַעְתֵּיהּ לְהָהוּא גַּבְרָא דַּאֲמַר לֵיהּ לְאוּשְׁכָּפָא: ״עֲבֵיד לִי מְסָאנֵי לְשַׁב שְׁנִין״, אַחֵיכְתְּ? אֲמַר לֵיהּ: הָהוּא, שִׁבְעָה יוֹמֵי לֵית לֵיהּ, מְסָאנֵי לְשַׁב שְׁנִין בָּעֵי?!

In addition, he asked: What is the reason that when you heard that man say to a shoemaker: Make me shoes that will last for seven years, you laughed? Ashmedai said to him: That man does not have seven days to live; does he need shoes that will last for seven years?
#### 13
מַאי טַעְמָא כִּי חֲזֵיתֵיהּ לְהָהוּא קַסָּמָא דַּהֲוָה קָסֵים, אַחֵיכְתְּ? אֲמַר לֵיהּ: דַּהֲוָה יְתֵיב אַבֵּי גַזָּא דְּמַלְכָּא, לִקְסוֹם מַאי דְּאִיכָּא תּוּתֵיהּ!

Benayahu then asked: What is the reason that when you saw that sorcerer performing magic you laughed? Ashmedai said to him: Because he was sitting on the king’s treasury [bei gaza]. Let him use his magic to know what there is buried underneath him.
#### 14
תַּרְחֵיהּ גַּבֵּיהּ עַד דְּבַנְיֵיהּ לְבֵית הַמִּקְדָּשׁ. יוֹמָא חַד הֲוָה קָאֵי לְחוֹדֵיהּ, אֲמַר לֵיהּ: כְּתִיב: ״כְּתוֹעֲפוֹת רְאֵם לוֹ״; וְאָמְרִינַן: ״כְּתוֹעֲפוֹת״ – אֵלּוּ מַלְאֲכֵי הַשָּׁרֵת, ״רְאֵם״ – אֵלּוּ הַשֵּׁדִים. מַאי רְבוּתַיְיכוּ מִינַּן?

Solomon kept Ashmedai with him until he completed building the Temple. One day he stood with Ashmedai alone. He said to Ashmedai: It is written: “For him like the lofty horns of the wild ox” [(Numbers 24:8)](bbl.torah#num#c24#8), and the Sages say in explanation of the verse: “Like the lofty horns”; these are the ministering angels. “The wild ox”; these are the demons. In what way are you greater than us? Why does the verse praise your abilities and powers over those of human beings?
#### 15
אֲמַר לֵיהּ: שְׁקוֹל שׁוּשִׁילְתָּא מִינַּאי, וְהַב לִי עִיזְקְתָךְ, וְאַחְוִי לָךְ רְבוּתַאי. שַׁקְלֵיהּ לְשׁוּשִׁילְתָּא מִינֵּיהּ, וְיָהֵיב לֵיהּ עִיזְקְתֵיהּ. בַּלְעֵיהּ, אוֹתְבֵיהּ לְחַד גַּפֵּיהּ בִּרְקִיעָא, וּלְחַד גַּפֵּיהּ בְּאַרְעָא, פַּתְקֵיהּ אַרְבַּע מְאָה פַּרְסֵי. עַל הַהִיא שַׁעְתָּא אֲמַר שְׁלֹמֹה: ״מַה יִּתְרוֹן לָאָדָם בְּכׇל עֲמָלוֹ שֶׁיַּעֲמֹל תַּחַת הַשָּׁמֶשׁ״.

Ashmedai said to him: Take the chain engraved with God’s name off me and give me your ring with God’s name engraved on it, and I will show you my strength. Solomon took the chain off him and he gave him his ring. Ashmedai swallowed the ring and grew until he placed one wing in the heaven and one wing on the earth. He threw Solomon a distance of four hundred parasangs. With regard to that moment Solomon said: “What profit is there for a person through all of his toil under the sun?” [(Ecclesiastes 1:3)](bbl.poetry#eccl#c1#3). With Solomon deposed from the throne, Ashmedai took his place.

״וְזֶה הָיָה חֶלְקִי מִכׇּל עֲמָלִי״ – מַאי ״וְזֶה״? רַב וּשְׁמוּאֵל; חַד אָמַר: מַקְלוֹ; וְחַד אָמַר: גּוּנְדּוֹ. הָיָה מְחַזֵּר עַל הַפְּתָחִים, כֹּל הֵיכָא דִּמְטָא, אָמַר: ״אֲנִי קֹהֶלֶת הָיִיתִי מֶלֶךְ עַל יִשְׂרָאֵל בִּירוּשָׁלִָים״. כִּי מְטָא גַּבֵּי סַנְהֶדְרִין, אֲמַרוּ רַבָּנַן: מִכְּדִי שׁוֹטֶה – בַּחֲדָא מִילְּתָא לָא סְרִיךְ, מַאי הַאי?

With regard to the verse: “And this was my portion from all of my toil” [(Ecclesiastes 2:10)](bbl.poetry##c2#10), the Gemara asks: What is the meaning of the expression: “And this”? This expression is always an allusion to an item that is actually in his hand or can be shown. Rav and Shmuel disagree with regard to the meaning of this phrase. One said: This is referring to Solomon’s staff that remained in his hand. And one said: This is referring to his cloak. Solomon circulated from door to door collecting charity, and wherever he arrived he would say: “I, Ecclesiastes, was king over Israel in Jerusalem” [(Ecclesiastes 1:12)](bbl.poetry#eccl#c1#12). When he finally arrived at the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem the sages said: Now, an imbecile does not fixate on one matter all of the time, so what is this matter? Is this man perhaps telling the truth that he is Solomon?

אֲמַרוּ לֵיהּ לִבְנָיָהוּ: קָא בָעֵי לָךְ מַלְכָּא לְגַבֵּיהּ? אֲמַר לְהוּ: לָא. שְׁלַחוּ לְהוּ לְמַלְכְּווֹתָא: קָאָתֵי מַלְכָּא לְגַבַּיְיכוּ? שְׁלַחוּ לְהוּ: אִין, קָאָתֵי. שְׁלַחוּ לְהוּ: בִּידְקוּ בְּכַרְעֵיהּ. שְׁלַחוּ לְהוּ: בְּמוּקֵי קָאָתֵי;

The sages said to Benayahu: Does the king require you to be with him? Benayahu said to them: No. They sent to the queens and asked: Does the king come to be with you? The queens sent a response to them: Yes, he comes. They sent a request to the queens: Check his feet to see if they are human feet. The queens sent a response to the sages: He always comes in socks [bemokei], and it is not possible to see his feet.

וְקָא תָבַע לְהוּ בְּנִידּוּתַיְיהוּ; וְקָא תָבַע לַהּ נָמֵי לְבַת שֶׁבַע אִימֵּיהּ. אַתְיוּהּ לִשְׁלֹמֹה, וְהַבוּ לֵיהּ עִזְקְתָא, וְשׁוּשִׁילְתָּא דַּחֲקִוק עָלֶיהָ שֵׁם. כִּי עָיֵיל, חַזְיֵיהּ, פְּרַח.

The queens continued discussing the king’s behavior: And he demands of them, i.e., the queens, to engage in sexual intercourse when they are menstruating. And he also demands that Bathsheba his mother engage in sexual intercourse with him. Once the Sanhedrin heard this they understood that this was an imposter and not actually Solomon. They brought Solomon, gave him a ring and the chain on which the name of God was carved. When Solomon entered, Ashmedai saw him and fled.

וַאֲפִילּוּ הָכִי, הֲוָה לֵיהּ בִּיעֲתוּתָא מִינֵּיהּ. וְהַיְינוּ דִּכְתִיב: ״הִנֵּה מִטָּתוֹ שֶׁלִּשְׁלֹמֹה שִׁשִּׁים גִּבּוֹרִים סָבִיב לָהּ מִגִּבּוֹרֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל, כּוּלָּם אֲחוּזֵי חֶרֶב מְלוּמְּדֵי מִלְחָמָה, אִישׁ חַרְבּוֹ עַל יְרֵיכוֹ מִפַּחַד בַּלֵּילוֹת״.

The Gemara adds: And even so, although Ashmedai fled, Solomon was fearful of him, and this is as it is written: “Behold the bed of Solomon surrounded by sixty strong men from the warriors of Israel. All of them holding swords and trained in war, each man with his sword on his thigh from fear in the nights” (Song of Songs 3:7–8).

רַב וּשְׁמוּאֵל, חַד אָמַר: מֶלֶךְ וְהֶדְיוֹט, וְחַד אָמַר: מֶלֶךְ וְהֶדְיוֹט וּמֶלֶךְ.

Rav and Shmuel disagreed with regard to this story of Solomon. One said: He was a king and afterward he became a commoner, and never returned to his position as king. And one said: He was a king, and became a commoner, and a king, as ultimately he returned to his throne and defeated Ashmedai.

(קהלת ה, יב) עושר שמור לבעליו לרעתו אמר ר"ל זה עושרו של קרח (דברים יא, ו) ואת כל היקום אשר ברגליהם א"ר אלעזר זה ממונו של אדם שמעמידו על רגליו ואמר רבי לוי משוי ג' מאות פרדות לבנות היו מפתחות של בית גנזיו של קרח וכולהו אקלידי וקילפי דגילדא

With regard to the verse: “Wealth is kept for the owner to his detriment” (Ecclesiastes 5:12), Reish Lakish says: This is referring to the wealth of Korah, which was of no use to him. The fact that Korah was wealthy is derived from the verse: “And all the substance that was at their feet” (Deuteronomy 11:6), as Rabbi Elazar says: This is referring to a person’s property, which stands him on his feet. And Rabbi Levi says: The keys alone to Korah’s treasury were a burden requiring three hundred white mules to transport them, and moreover, all the keys [aklidei] and locks were of leather. This conveys the vastness of his wealth.

אמר רב חנן בר רב חסדא אמר רב ואמרי לה א"ר חנן בר רבא אמר רב חמשה בתי עבודת כוכבים קבועין הן אלו הן בית בל בבבל בית נבו בכורסי תרעתא שבמפג צריפא שבאשקלון נשרא שבערביא 

§ Rav Ḥanan bar Rav Ḥisda says that Rav says, and some say that it was Rav Ḥanan bar Rava who says that Rav says: There are five established temples of idol worship, and they are: The temple of Bel in Babylonia; the temple of Nebo in the city of Khursei; the temple of Tirata, which is located in the city of Mapag; Tzerifa, which is located in Ashkelon; and Nashra, which is located in Arabia. 

כי אתא רב דימי הוסיפו עליהן יריד שבעין בכי נדבכה שבעכו איכא דאמרי נתברא שבעכו רב דימי מנהרדעא מתני איפכא יריד שבעכו נדבכה שבעין בכי

When Rav Dimi came from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said: The Sages added to these places the marketplace that is located in Ein Bekhi and Nadbekha, which is located in Akko. There are those who say that Rav Dimi was referring to Natbera that is located in Akko. Rav Dimi from Neharde’a teaches the opposite, that it is the marketplace that is located in Akko, and Nadbekha that is located in Ein Bekhi.
