And he said, “My mother, you did not understand my power. I first revealed it to you at the spring, where I led Joseph. He was crying, the child who is glorified because he is greater than everything, and Joseph was angry with you, saying, ‘Give your breast to your child.’ At once you gave it to him, as you went forth to the Mount of Olives, fleeing from Herod. And when you came to some trees you said to Joseph, ‘My lord, we are hungry, and what do we have to eat in this desert place?’ Then he rebuked you, saying,

‘What can I do for you? Is it not enough for you that I became a stranger to my family on your account; why didn’t you guard your virginity, so that you would [not] be found in this; and not only you, but I and my children too; now I live here with you, and I do not even know what will happen to my seven children.’

I say this to you Mary: know who I am and what power is upon me. And then he said to you, ‘There is no fruit that you could eat in the trees. This date-palm is tall, and I cannot climb it. I say to you that there is no one at all who has climbed, and there is nothing that a person will find in this desert. I have been afflicted from all side because of you, because I have left my country. And I am afflicted because I did not know the child that you have; I only know that he is not from me. But I have thought in my heart, perhaps I had intercourse with you while drunk, and that I am even worse because I had determined to protect [you]. And behold, now it has been made known that I was not negligent, because there were [only] five months when I received you in [my] custody. And behold, this child is more than five months; for yo embraced him with your hand.

Truly, he was not from your seed, but from the Holy Spirit. And he will not leave you hungry, but he will have mercy on you; he will provide for me, and he will remember that I am a sojourner, as you are a sojourner with me.’

Is this not everything that Joseph said to you? And the child stopped [nursing from] your breast, this one who is greater than all things, and he said to Joseph, ‘My father, why don’t you climb this date-palm and bring it to her, so that my mother might eat from it, as was said about it. And I will feed you: not only you, but also the fruit that comes forth from it. I will not be hungry even for one day.’ And the child turned and said to the date-palm, ‘Incline your head with your fruit, and satisfy my mother and father.’ And it inclined immediately. And who made it incline? Is it not because I have power, which was because of me? And you and Joseph were satisfied, because the date-palm’s branches were placed as a wave of the ocean on the shore, because I [had] joy and happiness in my body as it appeared.”27

Via quae ducit ad Bethleem milliario tertio ab Jerusalem, jacet Rachel, uxor Jacob, mater scilicet Joseph et Benjamin, quae requiescit in finibus Rama. In medio loco in media via aqua surgit, habens quasi sextarios septem, unde omnes complent satietatem bibendi, et nec augetur nec minuitur, et est suavis ad bibendum; et dicunt quod fugiens beata Maria in Aegyptum, sederit ibi cum puero, et sitiens oravit, et continuo aqua emanavit; et ipso loco modo ecclesia constructa est. 

On the way to Bethlehem, at the third milestone from Jerusalem, lies the body of Rachel, on the edge of the area called Ramah. There I saw standing water which came from a rock, of which you can take as much as you like up to seven pints. Everyone has his fill, and the water does not become less or more. It is indescribably sweet to drink, and people say that Saint Mary became thirsty on the flight into Egypt, and that when she stopped here this water immediately flowed. Nowadays there is also a church building there.29
