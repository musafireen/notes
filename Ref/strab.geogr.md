μάλιστα δ᾽ οἱ νῦν ἄμεινον ἔχοιεν ἄν τι λέγειν περὶ τῶν κατὰ Βρεττανοὺς καὶ Γερμανοὺς καὶ τοὺς περὶ τὸν Ἴστρον τούς τε ἐντὸς καὶ τοὺς ἐκτὸς Γέτας τε καὶ Τυρεγέτας καὶ Βαστάρνας, ἔτι δὲ τοὺς περὶ τὸν Καύκασον, οἷον Ἀλβανοὺς καὶ Ἴβηρας. ἀπήγγελται δ᾽ ἡμῖν καὶ ὑπὸ τῶν τὰ Παρθικὰ συγγραψάντων, τῶν περὶ Ἀπολλόδωρον τὸν Ἀρτεμιτηνόν, ἃ πολλῶν ἐκεῖνοι μᾶλλον ἀφώρισαν, τὰ περὶ τὴν Ὑρκανίαν καὶ τὴν Βακτριανήν: 

Writers of the present day can describe with more certainty [than formerly] the Britons, the Germans, and the dwellers on either side of the Danube, the Getæ,1 the Tyrigetæ, the Bastarnæ,2 the tribes dwelling by the Caucasus, such as the Albanians and Iberians.3 We are besides possessed of a description of Hyrcania4 and Bactriana in the Histories of Parthia written by such men as Apollodorus of Artemita,5 who leave detailed the boundaries [of those countries] with greater accuracy than other geographers.

τῶν τε Ῥωμαίων καὶ εἰς τὴν εὐδαίμονα Ἀραβίαν ἐμβαλόντων μετὰ στρατιᾶς νεωστί, ἧς ἡγεῖτο ἀνὴρ φίλος ἡμῖν καὶ ἑταῖρος Αἴλιος Γάλλος, καὶ τῶν ἐκ τῆς Ἀλεξανδρείας ἐμπόρων στόλοις ἤδη πλεόντων διὰ τοῦ Νείλου καὶ τοῦ Ἀραβίου κόλπου μέχρι τῆς Ἰνδικῆς, πολὺ μᾶλλον καὶ ταῦτα ἔγνωσται τοῖς νῦν ἢ τοῖς πρὸ ἡμῶν. ὅτε γοῦν Γάλλος ἐπῆρχε τῆς Αἰγύπτου, συνόντες αὐτῷ καὶ συναναβάντες μέχρι Συήνης καὶ τῶν Αἰθιοπικῶν ὅρων ἱστοροῦμεν, ὅτι καὶ ἑκατὸν [p. 158] καὶ εἴκοσι νῆες πλέοιεν ἐκ Μυὸς ὅρμου πρὸς τὴν Ἰνδικήν, πρότερον ἐπὶ τῶν Πτολεμαϊκῶν βασιλέων ὀλίγων παντάπασι θαρρούντων πλεῖν καὶ τὸν Ἰνδικὸν ἐμπορεύεσθαι φόρτον.

The entrance of a Roman army into Arabia Felix under the command of my friend and companion Ælius Gallus,6 and the traffic of the Alexandrian merchants whose vessels pass up the Nile and Arabian Gulf7 to India, have rendered us much better acquainted with these countries than our predecessors were. I was with Gallus at the time he was prefect of Egypt, and accompanied him as far as Syene and the frontiers of Ethiopia, and I found that about one hundred and twenty ships sail from Myos-hormos8 to India, although, in the time of the Ptolemies, scarcely any one would venture on this voyage and the commerce with the Indies.

1 The Getæ occupied a portion of present Moldavia; the Tyrigetæ were those of the Getæ who dwelt along the banks of the Tyras or Dniester.

2 The Bastarnæ occupied the south and eastern portions of Poland.

3 The Georgians of the present day.

4 Corcan.

5 The precise time when this writer lived is unknown. The work here referred to is also mentioned by Athenæus, xv. p. 682.

6 Prefect of Egypt in the reign of Augustus. This expedition into Arabia completely failed, through the treachery of the guide, a Roman named Syllæus. A long account of it is given by Strabo in the 16th book. ‘It would be extremely interesting. ‘says Professor Schmitz,’ to trace this expedition of Ælius Gallus into Arabia, but our knowledge of that country is as yet too scanty to enable us to identify the route as described by Strabo, who derived most of his information about Arabia from his friend Ælius Gallus.’

7 Red Sea.

8 Myos-hormos, Mouse's Harbour, a sea-port of Egypt on the coast of the Red Sea. Arrian says that it was one of the most celebrated ports on this sea. It was chosen by Ptolemy Philadelphus for the convenience of commerce, in preference to Arsinoe or Suez, on account of the diffi- culty of navigating the western extremity of the gulf. It was called also Aphroditis Portus, or the Port of Venus. Its modern name is Suffangeel-Bahri, or ‘Sponge of the Sea.’ Lemspriere.

Some, however, have not hesitated to identify Cephallenia with Dulichium, and others with Taphos, calling the Cephallenians Taphians, and likewise Teleboans, and to say that Amphitryon made an expedition thither with Cephalus, the son of Deïoneus, whom, an exile from Athens, he had taken along with him, and that when Amphitryon seized the island he gave it over to Cephalus, and that the island was named after Cephalus and the cities after his children. But this is not in accordance with Homer; for the Cephallenians were subject to Odysseus and Laertes, whereas Taphos was subject to Mentes:“I declare that I am Mentes the son of wise Anchialus, and I am lord over the oar loving Taphians.
”106Taphos is now called Taphius. Neither is Hellanicus107 in accord with Homer when he identifies Cephallenia with Dulichium, for Homer108 makes Dulichium and the remainder of the Echinades subject to Meges; and their inhabitants were Epeians, who had come there from Elis; and it is on this account that he calls Otus the Cyllenian“comrade of Phyleides109 and ruler of the high-hearted Epeians;
”110“but Odysseus led the high-hearted Cephallenians.
”111According to Homer, therefore, neither is Cephallenia Dulichium nor is Dulichium a part of Cephallenia, as Andron112 says; for the Epeians held possession of Dulichium, whereas the Cephallenians held possession of the whole of Cephallenia and were subject to Odysseus, whereas the Epeians were subject to Meges. Neither is Paleis called Dulichium by the poet, as Pherecydes writes. But that writer is most in opposition to Homer who identifies Cephallenia with Dulichium, if it be true that "fifty-two" of the suitors were "from Dulichium" and "twenty-four from Same";113 for in that case would not Homer say that fifty-two came from the island as a whole and a half of that number less two from a single one of its four cities? However, if one grants this, I shall ask what Homer can mean by "Same" in the passage,“Dulichium and Same and woody Zacynthos.

[21] Ἀκουσίλαος δ᾽ ὁ Ἀργεῖος ἐκ Καβειροῦς καὶ Ἡφαίστου Κάμιλλον λέγει, τοῦ δὲ τρεῖς Καβείρους, ὧν νύμφας Καβειρίδας: 

Acusilaüs,241 the Argive, calls Cadmilus the son of Cabeiro and Hephaestus, and Cadmilus the father of three Cabeiri, and these the fathers of the nymphs called Cabeirides. 

Φερεκύδης δ᾽ ἐξ Ἀπόλλωνος καὶ Ῥητίας Κύρβαντας ἐννέα, οἰκῆσαι δ᾽ αὐτοὺς ἐν Σαμοθρᾴκῃ: 

Pherecydes242 says that nine Cyrbantes were sprung from Apollo and Rhetia, and that they took up their abode in Samothrace; 

ἐκ δὲ Καβειροῦς τῆς Πρωτέως καὶ Ἡφαίστου Καβείρους τρεῖς καὶ νύμφας τρεῖς Καβειρίδας, ἑκατέροις δ᾽ ἱερὰ γίνεσθαι. 

and that three Cabeiri and three nymphs called Cabeirides were the children of Cabeiro, the daughter of Proteus, and Hephaestus, and that sacred rites were instituted in honor of each triad. 

μάλιστα μὲν οὖν ἐν Ἴμβρῳ καὶ Λήμνῳ τοὺς Καβείρους τιμᾶσθαι συμβέβηκεν, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐν Τροίᾳ κατὰ πόλεις: τὰ δ᾽ ὀνόματα αὐτῶν ἐστι μυστικά. 

Now it has so happened that the Cabeiri are most honored in Imbros and Lemnos, but they are also honored in separate cities of the Troad; their names, however, are kept secret. 

Ἡρόδοτος δὲ καὶ ἐν Μέμφει [p. 665] λέγει τῶν Καβείρων ἱερὰ καθάπερ καὶ τοῦ Ἡφαίστου, διαφθεῖραι δ᾽ αὐτὰ Καμβύσην. 

Herodotus243 says that there were temples of the Cabeiri in Memphis, as also of Hephaestus, but that Cambyses destroyed them. 

ἔστι δ᾽ ἀοίκητα τὰ χωρία τῆς τῶν δαιμόνων τούτων τιμῆς, τό τε Κορυβαντεῖον τὸ ἐν τῇ Ἁμαξιτίᾳ τῆς νῦν Ἀλεξανδρέων χώρας ἐγγὺς τοῦ Σμινθίου, καὶ ἡ Κορύβισσα ἐν τῇ Σκηψίᾳ περὶ ποταμὸν Εὐρήεντα καὶ κώμην ὁμώνυμον καὶ ἔτι χείμαρρον Αἰθαλόεντα. 

The places where these deities were worshipped are uninhabited, both the Corybanteium in Hamaxitia in the territory now belonging to the Alexandreians near Sminthium,244 and Corybissa in Scepsia in the neighborhood of the river Eurëeis and of the village which bears the same name and also of the winter torrent Aethalöeis. 

πιθανὸν δέ φησιν ὁ Σκήψιος, Κουρῆτας μὲν καὶ Κορύβαντας εἶναι τοὺς αὐτούς, οἳ περὶ τὰς τῆς μητρὸς τῶν θεῶν ἁγιστείας πρὸς ἐνόπλιον ὄρχησιν ᾔθεοι καὶ κόροι τυγχάνουσι παρειλημμένοι. 

The Scepsian says that it is probable that the Curetes and the Corybantes were the same, being those who had been accepted as young men, or "youths," for the war-dance in connection with the holy rites of the Mother of the gods, 

καὶ Κορύβαντες δὲ ἀπὸ τοῦ κορύπτοντας βαίνειν ὀρχηστικῶς, 

and also as "corybantes" from the fact that they "walked with a butting of their heads" in a dancing way.245 

οὓς καὶ βητάρμονας λέγει ὁ ποιητής 

These are called by the poet "betarmones":246

“δεῦτ᾽ ἄγε Φαιήκων βητάρμονες, ὅσσοι ἄριστοι.”1 

“Come now, all ye that are the best 'betarmones' of the Phaeacians.”247 

τῶν δὲ Κορυβάντων ὀρχηστικῶν καὶ ἐνθουσιαστικῶν ὄντων καὶ τοὺς μανικῶς κινουμένους κορυβαντιᾶν φαμεν.
1 Hom. Od. 8.250

And because the Corybantes are inclined to dancing and to religious frenzy, we say of those who are stirred with frenzy that they are "corybantising." [22]

And there is Syros (the first syllable is pronounced long), where Pherecydes332 the son of Babys was born. The Athenian Pherecydes is later than he.333 The poet seems to mention this island, though he calls it Syria:“There is an island called Syria, above Ortygia.

καὶ οἱ νῦν δὲ ἐξ Αἰγύπτου πλέοντες ἐμπορικοὶ τῷ Νείλῳ καὶ τῷ Ἀραβίῳ κόλπῳ μέχρι τῆς Ἰνδικῆς σπάνιοι μὲν καὶ περιπεπλεύκασι μέχρι τοῦ Γάγγου, καὶ οὗτοι δ᾽ ἰδιῶται καὶ οὐδὲν πρὸς ἱστορίαν τῶν τόπων χρήσιμοι. κἀκεῖθεν δὲ ἀφ᾽ ἑνὸς τόπου καὶ παρ᾽ ἑνὸς βασιλέως, Πανδίονος κατ᾽ ἄλλους Πώρου, ἧκεν ὡς Καίσαρα τὸν Σεβαστὸν δῶρα καὶ πρεσβεῖα καὶ ὁ κατακαύσας ἑαυτὸν Ἀθήνησι σοφιστὴς Ἰνδός, καθάπερ καὶ ὁ Κάλανος Ἀλεξάνδρῳ τὴν τοιαύτην θέαν ἐπιδειξάμενος.

Very few of the merchants who now sail from Egypt by the Nile and the Arabian Gulf to India have proceeded as far as the Ganges; and, being ignorant persons, were not qualified to give an account of places they have visited. From one place in India, and from one king, namely, Pandion, or, according to others,1 Porus, presents and embassies were sent to Augustus Caesar. With the ambassadors came the Indian Gymno-Sophist, who committed himself to the flames at Athens,2 like Calanus, who exhibited the same spectacle in the presence of Alexander.

᾿εκεῖνος μὲν δὴ ἐπίστευσεν: ἡμῖν δὲ τίς ἂν δικαία γένοιτο πίστις περὶ τῶν Ἰνδικῶν ἐκ τῆς τοιαύτης στρατείας τοῦ Κύρου ἢ τῆς Σεμιράμιδος; συναποφαίνεται [p. 957] δέ πως καὶ Μεγασθένης τῷ λόγῳ τούτῳ κελεύων ἀπιστεῖν ταῖς ἀρχαίαις περὶ Ἰνδῶν ἱστορίαις: οὔτε γὰρ παρ᾽ Ἰνδῶν ἔξω σταλῆναί ποτε στρατιάν, οὔτ᾽ ἐπελθεῖν ἔξωθεν καὶ κρατῆσαι πλὴν τῆς μεθ᾽ Ἡρακλέους καὶ Διονύσου καὶ τῆς νῦν μετὰ Μακεδόνων. καίτοι Σέσωστριν μὲν τὸν Αἰγύπτιον καὶ Τεάρκωνα τὸν Αἰθίοπα ἕως Εὐρώπης προελθεῖν, Ναβοκοδρόσορον δὲ τὸν παρὰ Χαλδαίοις εὐδοκιμήσαντα Ἡρακλέους μᾶλλον καὶ ἕως Στηλῶν ἐλάσαι. μέχρι μὲν δὴ δεῦρο καὶ Τεάρκωνα ἀφικέσθαι, ἐκεῖνον δὲ καὶ ἐκ τῆς Ἰβηρίας εἰς τὴν Θρᾴκην καὶ τὸν Πόντον ἀγαγεῖν τὴν στρατιάν: Ἰδάνθυρσον δὲ τὸν Σκύθην ἐπιδραμεῖν τῆς Ἀσίας μέχρι Αἰγύπτου: τῆς δὲ Ἰνδικῆς μηδένα τούτων ἅψασθαι: καὶ Σεμίραμιν δ᾽ ἀποθανεῖν πρὸ τῆς ἐπιχειρήσεως: Πέρσας δὲ μισθοφόρους μὲν ἐκ τῆς Ἰνδικῆς μεταπέμψασθαι Ὑδράκας, ἐκεῖ δὲ μὴ στρατεῦσαι, ἀλλ᾽ ἐγγὺς ἐλθεῖν μόνον ἡνίκα Κῦρος ἤλαυνεν ἐπὶ Μασσαγέτας.

But how can we place any just confidence in the accounts of India derived from such expeditions as those of Cyrus and Semiramis? Megasthenes concurs in this opinion; he advises persons not to credit the ancient histories of India, for, except the expeditions of Hercules, of Bacchus, and the later invasion of Alexander, no army was ever sent out of their country by the Indians, nor did any foreign enemy ever invade or conquer it. Sesostris the Egyptian (he says), and Tearco the Ethiopian, advanced as far as Europe; and Nabocodrosor, who was more celebrated among the Chaldæans than Hercules among the Greeks, penetrated even as far as the Pillars,1 which Tearco also reached; Sesostris conducted an army from Iberia to Thrace and Pontus; Idanthyrsus the Scythian overran Asia as far as Egypt; but not one of these persons proceeded as far as India, and Semiramis died before her intended enterprise was undertaken. The Persians had sent for the Hydraces2 from India, a body of mercenary troops; but they did not lead an army into that country, and only approached it when Cyrus was marching against the Massagetæ.

1 It is evident that the name Pillars misled Megasthenes or the writers from whom he borrowed the facts; for it is impossible to suppose that Tearcho, who reigned in Arabia, or that Nabuchodonosor, who reigned at Babylon, ever conducted an army across the desert and through the whole breadth of Africa to the Straits of Gibraltar, to which place nothing invited them, and the existence of which, as well as that of the neighbouring countries, must have been unknown. The Egyptians, Arabians, and Babylonians directed their invasions towards the north, to Palestine, Syria, Mesopotamia, Armenia, Iberia, and Colchis. This was the line of march followed by Sesostris. Ptolemy indicates the existence of ‘Pillars,’ which he calls ‘the Pillars of Alexander,’ above Albania and Iberia, at the commencement of the Asiatic Sarmatia. But as it is known that Alexander never penetrated into these regions, it is clear that the title ‘of Alexander’ was added by the Greeks to the names of mountains, which separated a country partly civilized from that entirely occupied by hordes of savages. Everything therefore seems to show, that these Pillars near Iberia in Asia, and not the Pillars of Hercules in Europe, formed the boundary of the expeditions of Sesostris, Tearcho, and Nabuchodonosor.—Gossellin.

2 As the Oxydraci are here meant, Groskurd adopts this name in the text. They were settled in Sagur and Outch, of the province of Lahore.

᾿εκ δὲ τῶν τοιούτων Νυσαίους δή τινας ἔθνος προσωνόμασαν καὶ πόλιν παρ᾽ αὐτοῖς Νῦσαν Διονύσου κτίσμα, καὶ ὄρος τὸ ὑπὲρ τῆς πόλεως Μηρόν, αἰτιασάμενοι καὶ τὸν αὐτόθι κισσὸν καὶ ἄμπελον, οὐδὲ ταύτην τελεσίκαρπον: ἀπορρεῖ γὰρ ὁ βότρυς πρὶν περκάσαι διὰ τοὺς ὄμβρους τοὺς ἄδην: Διονύσου δ᾽ ἀπογόνους τοὺς Συδράκας ἀπὸ τῆς ἀμπέλου τῆς παρ᾽ αὐτοῖς καὶ τῶν πολυτελῶν ἐξόδων, βακχικῶς τάς τε ἐκστρατείας ποιουμένων τῶν βασιλέων καὶ τὰς ἄλλας ἐξόδους μετὰ τυμπανισμοῦ καὶ εὐανθοῦς στολῆς: ὅπερ ἐπιπολάζει καὶ παρὰ τοῖς ἄλλοις Ἰνδοῖς.

[p. 959]

From such stories as those related above, they gave the name of Nysæans to some imaginary nation, and called their city Nysa, founded by Bacchus; a mountain above the city they called Meron, alleging as a reason for imposing these names that the ivy and vine grow there, although the latter does not perfect its fruit; for the bunches of grapes, in consequence of excessive rains, drop off before they arrive at maturity.

They say, also, that the Sydracæ (Oxydracæ) are descendants of Bacchus, because the vine grows in their country, and because their kings display great pomp in setting out on their warlike expeditions, after the Bacchie manner; whenever they appear in public, it is with beating of drums, and are dressed in flowered robes, which is the common custom among the other Indians. 1 When Alexander took, on the first assault, Aornos,2 a fortress on a rock, the foot of which is washed by the Indus near its source, his flatterers exaggerated this act, and said that Hercules thrice assailed this rock and was thrice repulsed.

They pretended that the Sibæ3 were descended from the people who accompanied Hercules in his expedition, and that they retained badges of their descent; that they wore skins like Hercules, and carried clubs, and branded with the mark of a club their oxen and mules. They confirm this fable with stories about Caucasus4 and Prometheus, for they transferred hither from Pontus these tales, on the slight pretence that they had seen a sacred cave among the Paropamisadæ.5 This they alleged was the prison of Prometheus, that Hercules came hither to release Prometheus, and that this mountain was the Caucasus, to which the Greeks represent Prometheus as having been bound.

1 Eurip. Bacchæ, v. 13.—Wodehull.

2 Strabo takes for the source of the Indus the place where it passes through the mountains to enter the Punjab. The site of Aornos seems to correspond with Renas.—Gossellin.

3 The Sibæ, according to Quintus Curtius, who gives them the name of Sobii, occupied the confluent of the Hydaspes and the Acesines. This people appear to have been driven towards the east by one of those revolutions so frequent in all Asia. At least, to the north of Delhi, and in the neighbourhood of Hardouar, a district is found bearing the name of Siba.

4 That is, the Macedonians transferred the name of the Caucasus, situated between the Black Sea and the Caspian, to the mountains of India. The origin of their mistake arose from the Indians giving, as at present, the name of Kho, which signifies ‘white,’ to the great chain of mountains covered with snow, from whence the Indus, and the greater part of the rivers which feed it, descend.

5 This people occupied the Paropamisus, where the mountains now separate Candahar from Gaour.

῎αλλην δὲ διαίρεσιν ποιεῖται * περὶ τῶν φιλοσόφων, δύο γένη φάσκων, ὧν τοὺς μὲν Βραχμᾶνας καλεῖ τοὺς δὲ Γαρμᾶνας. 

Megasthenes divides the philosophers again into two kinds, the Brachmanes1 and the Garmanes.2 

τοὺς μὲν οὖν Βραχμᾶνας εὐδοκιμεῖν μᾶλλον: μᾶλλον γὰρ καὶ ὁμολογεῖν ἐν τοῖς δόγμασιν: 

The Brachmanes are held in greater repute, for they agree more exactly in their opinions. 

ἤδη δ᾽ εὐθὺς καὶ κυομένους ἔχειν ἐπιμελητὰς λογίους ἄνδρας, οὓς προσιόντας λόγῳ μὲν ἐπᾴδειν δοκεῖν καὶ τὴν μητέρα καὶ τὸν κυόμενον εἰς εὐτεκνίαν, τὸ δ᾽ ἀληθὲς σωφρονικάς τινας παραινέσεις καὶ ὑποθήκας διδόναι: τὰς δ᾽ ἥδιστα ἀκροωμένας μάλιστα εὐτέκνους εἶναι νομίζεσθαι. 

Even from the time of their conception in the womb they are under the care and guardianship of learned men, who go to the mother, and seem to perform some incantation for the happiness and welfare of the mother and the unborn child, but in reality they suggest prudent advice, and the mothers who listen to them most willingly are thought to be the most fortunate in their offspring. 

μετὰ δὲ τὴν γένεσιν ἄλλους καὶ ἄλλους διαδέχεσθαι τὴν ἐπιμέλειαν, ἀεὶ τῆς μείζονος ἡλικίας χαριεστέρων τυγχανούσης διδασκάλων. 

After the birth of the children, there is a succession of persons who have the care of them, and as they advance in years, masters more able and accomplished succeed.


διατρίβειν δὲ τοὺς φιλοσόφους ἐν ἄλσει πρὸ τῆς πόλεως ὑπὸ περιβόλῳ συμμέτρῳ, 

The philosophers live in a grove in front of the city within a moderate-sized enclosure. 

λιτῶς ζῶντας ἐν στιβάσι καὶ δοραῖς, 

Their diet is frugal, and they lie upon straw pallets and on skins. 

ἀπεχομένους ἐμψύχων καὶ ἀφροδισίων, 

They abstain from animal food, and from sexual intercourse with women; 

ἀκροωμένους λόγων σπουδαίων, μεταδιδόντας καὶ τοῖς ἐθέλουσι: τὸν δ᾽ ἀκροώμενον οὔτε λαλῆσαι θέμις οὔτε χρέμψασθαι ἀλλ᾽ οὐδὲ πτύσαι, ἢ ἐκβάλλεσθαι τῆς συνουσίας τὴν ἡμέραν ἐκείνην ὡς ἀκολασταίνοντα. 

their time is occupied in grave discourse, and they communicate with those who are inclined to listen to them; but the hearer is not permitted to speak or cough, or even to spit on the ground; otherwise, he is expelled that very day from their society, on the ground of having no control over himself. 

ἔτη δ᾽ ἑπτὰ καὶ τριάκοντα οὕτως ζήσαντα ἀναχωρεῖν εἰς τὴν ἑαυτοῦ κτῆσιν ἕκαστον καὶ ζῆν ἀδεῶς καὶ ἀνειμένως μᾶλλον, σινδονοφοροῦντα καὶ χρυσοφοροῦντα μετρίως ἐν τοῖς ὠσὶ καὶ ταῖς χερσί, 

After living thirty-seven years in this manner, each individual retires to his own possessions, and lives with less restraint, wearing robes of fine linen, and rings of gold, but without profuseness, upon the hands and in the ears. 

προσφερόμενον σάρκας τῶν μὴ πρὸς τὴν χρείαν συνεργῶν ζῴων, δριμέων καὶ ἀρτυτῶν ἀπεχόμενον: 

They eat the flesh of animals, of those particularly which do not assist man in his labour, and abstain from hot and seasoned food. 

γαμεῖν δ᾽ ὅτι πλείστας εἰς πολυτεκνίαν: ἐκ πολλῶν γὰρ καὶ τὰ σπουδαῖα πλείω γίνεσθαι ἄν, 

They have as many wives as they please with a view to numerous offspring, for from many wives greater advantages are derived.


ἀδουλοῦσί τε τὴν ἐκ τέκνων ὑπηρεσίαν ἐγγυτάτω οὖσαν πλείω δεῖν παρασκευάζεσθαι. 

As they have no slaves, they require more the services, which are at hand, of their children.


ταῖς δὲ γυναιξὶ ταῖς γαμεταῖς μὴ συμφιλοσοφεῖν τοὺς Βραχμᾶνας, εἰ μὲν μοχθηραὶ γένοιντο, [p. 993] ἵνα μή τι τῶν οὐ θεμιτῶν ἐκφέροιεν εἰς τοὺς βεβήλους εἰ δὲ σπουδαῖαι, μὴ καταλείποιεν αὐτούς. 

The Brachmanes do not communicate their philosophy to their wives, for fear they should divulge to the profane, if they became depraved, anything which ought to be concealed or lest they should abandon their husbands in case they became good (philosophers) themselves. 

οὐδένα γὰρ ἡδονῆς καὶ πόνου καταφρονοῦντα, ὡς δ᾽ αὕτως ζωῆς καὶ θανάτου, ἐθέλειν ὑφ᾽ ἑτέρῳ εἶναι: τοιοῦτον δ᾽ εἶναι τὸν σπουδαῖον καὶ τὴν σπουδαίαν. 

For no one who despises alike pleasure and pain, life and death, is willing to be subject to the authority of another; and such is the character of a virtuous man and a virtuous woman.


πλείστους δ᾽ αὐτοῖς εἶναι λόγους περὶ τοῦ θανάτου: νομίζειν γὰρ δὴ τὸν μὲν ἐνθάδε βίον ὡς ἂν ἀκμὴν κυομένων εἶναι, τὸν δὲ θάνατον γένεσιν εἰς τὸν ὄντως βίον καὶ τὸν εὐδαίμονα τοῖς φιλοσοφήσασι: 

They discourse much on death, for it is their opinion that the present life is the state of one conceived in the womb, and that death to philosophers is birth to a real and a happy life. 

διὸ τῇ ἀσκήσει πλείστῃ χρῆσθαι πρὸς τὸ ἑτοιμοθάνατον: ἀγαθὸν δὲ ἢ κακὸν μηδὲν εἶναι τῶν συμβαινόντων ἀνθρώποις: οὐ γὰρ ἂν τοῖς αὐτοῖς τοὺς μὲν ἄχθεσθαι τοὺς δὲ χαίρειν ἐνυπνιώδεις ὑπολήψεις ἔχοντας, καὶ τοὺς αὐτοὺς τοῖς αὐτοῖς τοτὲ μὲν ἄχθεσθαι τοτὲ δ᾽ αὖ χαίρειν μεταβαλλομένους. 

They therefore discipline themselves much to prepare for death, and maintain that nothing which happens to man is bad or good, for otherwise the same things would not be the occasion of sorrow to some and of joy to others, opinions being merely dreams, nor that the same persons could be affected with sorrow and joy by the same things, on different occasions.


τὰ δὲ περὶ φύσιν τὰ μὲν εὐήθειαν ἐμφαίνειν φησίν: ἐν ἔργοις γὰρ αὐτοὺς κρείττους ἢ λόγοις εἶναι, διὰ μύθων τὰ πολλὰ πιστουμένους: 

With regard to opinions on physical phenomena, they display, says Megasthenes, great simplicity, their actions being better than their reasoning, for their belief is chiefly founded on fables. 

περὶ πολλῶν δὲ τοῖς Ἕλλησιν ὁμοδοξεῖν: 

On many subjects their sentiments are the same as those of the Greeks. 

ὅτι γὰρ γενητὸς ὁ κόσμος καὶ φθαρτὸς λέγειν κἀκείνους, καὶ ὅτι σφαιροειδὴς 

According to the Brachmanes, the world was created, and is liable to corruption; it is of a spheroïdal figure; 

ὅ τε διοικῶν αὐτὸν καὶ ποιῶν θεὸς δι᾽ ὅλου διαπεφοίτηκεν αὐτοῦ: 

the god who made and governs it pervades the whole of it; 

ἀρχαὶ δὲ τῶν μὲν συμπάντων ἕτεραι, τῆς δὲ κοσμοποιίας τὸ ὕδωρ: 

the principles of all things are different, but the principle of the world's formation was water; 

πρὸς δὲ τοῖς τέτταρσι στοιχείοις πέμπτη τις ἐστὶ φύσις, ἐξ ἧς ὁ οὐρανὸς καὶ τὰ ἄστρα: 

in addition to the four elements there is a fifth nature, of which the heavens and the stars are composed; 

γῆ δ᾽ ἐν μέσῳ ἵδρυται τοῦ παντός: 

the earth is situated in the centre of the universe. 

καὶ περὶ σπέρματος δὲ καὶ ψυχῆς ὅμοια λέγεται καὶ ἄλλα πλείω: 

Many other peculiar things they say of the principle of generation and of the soul. 

παραπλέκουσι δὲ καὶ μύθους, ὥσπερ καὶ Πλάτων περί τε ἀφθαρσίας ψυχῆς καὶ τῶν καθ᾽ ᾄδου κρίσεων καὶ ἄλλα τοιαῦτα. 

They invent fables also, after the manner of Plato, on the immortality of the soul, and on the punishments in Hades, and other things of this kind. 

περὶ μὲν τῶν Βραχμάνων ταῦτα λέγει.

This is the account which Megasthenes gives of the Brachmanes.

### 60

τοὺς δὲ Γαρμᾶνας τοὺς μὲν ἐντιμοτάτους ὑλοβίους φησὶν ὀνομάζεσθαι, ζῶντας ἐν ταῖς ὕλαις ἀπὸ φύλλων καὶ καρπῶν ἀγρίων, * 

Of the Garmanes, the most honourable, he says, are the Hylobii, who live in the forests, and subsist on leaves and wild fruits: 

ἐσθῆτος φλοιῶν δενδρείων, ἀφροδισίων χωρὶς καὶ οἴνου: 

they are clothed with garments made of the bark of trees,1 and abstain from commerce with women and from wine. 

τοῖς δὲ βασιλεῦσι [p. 994] συνεῖναι, δι᾽ ἀγγέλων πυνθανομένοις περὶ τῶν αἰτίων καὶ δι᾽ ἐκείνων θεραπεύουσι καὶ λιτανεύουσι τὸ θεῖον. 

The kings hold communication with them by messengers, concerning the causes of things, and through them worship and supplicate the Divinity.

μετὰ δὲ τοὺς ὑλοβίους δευτερεύειν κατὰ τιμὴν τοὺς ἰατρικοὺς καὶ ὡς περὶ τὸν ἄνθρωπον φιλοσόφους,

Second in honour to the Hylobii, are the physicians, for they apply philosophy to the study of the nature of man. 

λιτοὺς μὲν μὴ ἀγραύλους δέ, ὀρύζῃ καὶ ἀλφίτοις τρεφομένους, ἃ παρέχειν αὐτοῖς πάντα τὸν αἰτηθέντα καὶ ὑποδεξάμενον ξενίᾳ: 

They are of frugal habits, but do not live in the fields, and subsist upon rice and meal, which every one gives when asked, and receive them hospitably. 

δύνασθαι δὲ καὶ πολυγόνους ποιεῖν καὶ ἀρρενογόνους καὶ θηλυγόνους διὰ φαρμακευτικῆς: 

They are able to cause persons to have a numerous offspring, and to have either male or female children, by means of charms. 

τὴν δὲ ἰατρείαν διὰ σιτίων τὸ πλέον, οὐ διὰ φαρμάκων ἐπιτελεῖσθαι: 

They cure diseases by diet, rather than by medicinal remedies. 

τῶν φαρμάκων δὲ μάλιστα εὐδοκιμεῖν τὰ ἐπίχριστα καὶ τὰ καταπλάσματα, 

Among the latter, the most in repute are unguents and cataplasms. 

τἆλλα δὲ κακουργίας πολὺ μετέχειν. 

All others they suppose partake greatly of a noxious nature.

ἀσκεῖν δὲ καὶ τούτους κἀκείνους καρτερίαν τήν τε ἐν πόνοις καὶ τὴν ἐν ταῖς ἐπιμοναῖς, ὥστ᾽ ἐφ᾽ ἑνὸς σχήματος ἀκίνητον διατελέσαι τὴν ἡμέραν ὅλην. 

Both this and the other class of persons practise fortitude, as well in supporting active toil as in enduring suffering, so that they will continue a whole day in the same posture, without motion.

ἄλλους δ᾽ εἶναι τοὺς μὲν μαντικοὺς καὶ ἐπῳδοὺς καὶ τῶν περὶ τοὺς κατοιχομένους λόγων καὶ νομίμων ἐμπείρους, ἐπαιτοῦντας1 κατὰ κώμας καὶ πόλεις, 

There are enchanters and diviners, versed in the rites and customs relative to the dead, who go about villages and towns begging. 

τοὺς δὲ χαριεστέρους μὲν τούτων καὶ ἀστειοτέρους, οὐδ᾽ αὐτοὺς δὲ ἀπεχομένους τῶν καθ᾽ ᾄδην θρυλουμένων ὅσα δοκεῖ πρὸς εὐσέβειαν καὶ ὁσιότητα:

There are others who are more civilized and better informed than these, who inculcate the vulgar opinions concerning Hades, which, according to their ideas, tend to piety and sanctity. 

συμφιλοσοφεῖν δ᾽ ἐνίοις καὶ γυναῖκας ἀπεχομένας καὶ αὐτὰς ἀφροδισίων.

Women study philosophy with some of them, but abstain from sexual intercourse.

### 61
᾿αριστόβουλος δὲ τῶν ἐν Ταξίλοις σοφιστῶν ἰδεῖν δύο φησί, Βραχμᾶνας ἀμφοτέρους, τὸν μὲν πρεσβύτερον ἐξυρημένον τὸν δὲ νεώτερον κομήτην, ἀμφοτέροις δ᾽ ἀκολουθεῖν μαθητάς: 

Aristobulus says, that he saw at Taxila two sophists (wise men), both Brachmanes, the elder had his head shaved, but the younger wore his hair; both were attended by disciples. 

τὸν μὲν οὖν ἄλλον χρόνον κατ᾽ ἀγορὰν διατρίβειν, 

When not otherwise engaged, they spent their time in the market-place. 

τιμωμένους ἀντὶ συμβούλων, ἐξουσίαν ἔχοντας ὅ τι βούλονται τῶν ὠνίων φέρεσθαι δωρεάν: ὅτῳ δ᾽ ἂν προσίωσι, καταχεῖν αὐτῶν τοῦ σησαμίνου λίπους ὥστε καὶ κατὰ τῶν ὀμμάτων [p. 995] ῥεῖν: 

They are honoured as public counsellors, and have the liberty of taking away, without payment, whatever article they like which is exposed for sale; when any one accosts them, he pours over them oil of jessamine, in such profusion that it runs down from their eyes. 

τοῦ τε μέλιτος πολλοῦ προκειμένου καὶ τοῦ σησάμου μάζας ποιουμένους τρέφεσθαι δωρεάν: 

Of honey and sesamum, which is exposed for sale in large quantity, they take enough to make cakes, and are fed without expense.


παρερχομένους δὲ καὶ πρὸς τὴν Ἀλεξάνδρου τράπεζαν, παραστάντας δειπνεῖν καὶ καρτερίαν διδάσκειν, παραχωροῦντας εἴς τινα τόπον πλησίον, ὅπου τὸν μὲν πρεσβύτερον πεσόντα ὕπτιον ἀνέχεσθαι τῶν ἡλίων καὶ τῶν ὄμβρων （ἤδη γὰρ ὕειν ἀρχομένου τοῦ ἔαρος）, 

They came up to Alexander's table and took their meal standing, and they gave an example of their fortitude by retiring to a neighbouring spot, where the elder, falling on the ground supine, endured the sun and the rain, which had now set in, it being the commencement of spring. 

τὸν δ᾽ ἑστάναι μονοσκελῆ ξύλον ἐπηρμένον ἀμφοτέραις ταῖς χερσὶν ὅσον τρίπηχυ, κάμνοντος δὲ τοῦ σκέλους ἐπὶ θάτερον μεταφέρειν τὴν βάσιν καὶ διατελεῖν οὕτως τὴν ἡμέραν ὅλην: 

The other stood on one leg, with a piece of wood three cubits in length raised in both hands; when one leg was fatigued he changed the support to the other, and thus continued the whole day. 

φανῆναι δ᾽ ἐγκρατέστερον μακρῷ τὸν νεώτερον: συνακολουθήσαντα γὰρ μικρὰ τῷ βασιλεῖ ταχὺ ἀναστρέψαι πάλιν ἐπ᾽ οἴκου, 

The younger appeared to possess much more self-command; for, after following the king a short distance, he soon returned to his home. 

μετιόντος τε αὐτὸν κελεῦσαι ἥκειν εἴτου βούλεται τυγχάνειν: 

The king sent after him, but he bade the king to come to him, if he wanted anything of him. 

τὸν δὲ συναπᾶραι μέχρι τέλους καὶ μεταμφιάσασθαι καὶ μεταθέσθαι τὴν δίαιταν συνόντα τῷ βασιλεῖ: ἐπιτιμώμενον δ᾽ ὑπό τινων λέγειν ὡς ἐκπληρώσειε τὰ τετταράκοντα ἔτη τῆς ἀσκήσεως, ἃ ὑπέσχετο, Ἀλέξανδρον δὲ τοῖς παισὶν αὐτοῦ δοῦναι δωρεάν.

The other accompanied the king to the last: during his stay he changed his dress, and altered his mode of life, and when reproached for his conduct, answered, that he had completed the forty years of discipline which he had promised to observe: Alexander made presents to his children.

### 62

τῶν δ᾽ ἐν Ταξίλοις νομίμων καινὰ καὶ ἀήθη λέγει τό τε τοὺς μὴ δυναμένους ἐκδιδόναι τὰς παῖδας ὑπὸ πενίας προάγειν εἰς ἀγορὰν ἐν ἀκμῇ τῆς ὥρας, κόχλῳ τε καὶ τυμπάνοις οἷσπερ καὶ τὸ πολεμικὸν σημαίνουσιν ὄχλου προσκληθέντος, τῷ δὲ προσελθόντι τὰ ὀπίσθια πρῶτον ἀνασύρεσθαι μέχρι τῶν ὤμων εἶτα τὰ πρόσθεν, ἀρέσασαν δὲ καὶ συμπεισθεῖσαν ἐφ᾽ οἷς ἂν δοκῇ συνοικεῖν: 

Aristobulus relates also some strange and unusual customs of the people of Taxila. Those, who through poverty are unable to marry their daughters, expose them for sale in the market-place, in the flower of their age, to the sound of shell trumpets and drums, with which the war-note is given. A crowd is thus assembled. First her back, as far as the shoulders, is uncovered, then the parts in front, for the examination of any man who comes for this purpose. If she pleases him, he marries her on such conditions as may be determined upon.

καὶ τὸ γυψὶ ῥίπτεσθαι τὸν τετελευτηκότα. τὸ δὲ πλείους ἔχειν γυναῖκας κοινὸν καὶ ἄλλων. παρά τισι δ᾽ ἀκούειν φησὶ καὶ συγκατακαιομένας τὰς γυναῖκας τοῖς ἀνδράσιν ἀσμένας, τὰς δὲ μὴ ὑπομενούσας ἀδοξεῖν. εἴρηται καὶ ἄλλοις ταῦτα.

The dead are thrown out to be devoured by vultures. To have many wives is a custom common to these and to other nations. He says, that he had heard, from some persons, of wives burning themselves voluntarily with their deceased husbands; and that those women who refused to submit to this custom were disgraced. The same things have been told by other writers.1

1 According to Diodorus Siculus, xix. 33, an exception was made for women with child, or with a family; but otherwise, if she did not comply with this custom, she was compelled to remain a widow during the rest of her life, and to take no part in sacrifices or other rites, as being an impious person.

### 63
Ὀνησίκριτος δὲ πεμφθῆναί φησιν αὐτὸς [p. 996] διαλεξόμενος τοῖς σοφισταῖς τούτοις: ἀκούειν γὰρ τὸν Ἀλέξανδρον ὡς γυμνοὶ διατελοῖεν καὶ καρτερίας ἐπιμελοῖντο οἱ ἄνθρωποι ἐν τιμῇ τε ἄγοιντο πλείστῃ, παρ᾽ ἄλλους δὲ μὴ βαδίζοιεν κληθέντες, ἀλλὰ κελεύοιεν ἐκείνους φοιτᾶν παρ᾽ αὐτούς, εἴ του μετασχεῖν ἐθέλοιεν τῶν πραττομένων ἢ λεγομένων ὑπ᾽ αὐτῶν: τοιούτων δὴ ὄντων, ἐπειδὴ οὔτε αὐτῷ πρέπειν ἐδόκει παρ᾽ ἐκείνους φοιτᾶν οὔτε ἐκείνους βιάζεσθαι παρὰ τὰ πάτρια ποιεῖν τι ἄκοντας, αὐτὸς ἔφη πεμφθῆναι. 

Onesicritus says, that he himself was sent to converse with these wise men. For Alexander heard that they went about naked, practised constancy and fortitude, and were held in the highest honour; that, when invited, they did not go to other persons, but commanded others to come to them, if they wished to participate in their exercises or their conversation. Such being their character, Alexander did not consider it to be consistent with propriety to go to them, nor to compel them to do anything contrary to their inclination or against the custom of their country; he therefore despatched Onesicritus to them.

καταλαβεῖν δὲ ἄνδρας πεντεκαίδεκα ἀπὸ σταδίων εἴκοσι τῆς πόλεως, ἄλλον ἐν ἄλλῳ σχήματι ἑστῶτα ἢ καθήμενον ἢ κείμενον γυμνὸν ἀκίνητον ἕως ἑσπέρας, εἶτ᾽ ἀπερχόμενον εἰς τὴν πόλιν: χαλεπώτατον δ᾽ εἶναι τὸ τὸν ἥλιον ὑπομεῖναι οὕτω θερμὸν ὥστε τῶν ἄλλων μηδένα ὑπομένειν γυμνοῖς ἐπιβῆναι τοῖς ποσὶ τῆς γῆς ῥᾳδίως κατὰ μεσημβρίαν.

Onesicritus found, at the distance of 20 stadia from the city, fifteen men standing in different postures, sitting or lying down naked, who continued in these positions until the evening, and then returned to the city. The most difficult thing to endure was the heat of the sun, which was so powerful, that no one else could endure without pain to walk on the ground at mid-day with bare feet.

### 64
διαλεχθῆναι δ᾽ ἑνὶ τούτων Καλάνῳ, ὃν καὶ συνακολουθῆσαι τῷ βασιλεῖ μέχρι Περσίδος καὶ ἀποθανεῖν τῷ πατρίῳ νόμῳ τεθέντα ἐπὶ πυρκαϊάν: 

He conversed with Calanus, one of these sophists, who accompanied the king to Persia, and died after the custom of his country, being placed on a pile of [burning] wood. 

τότε δ᾽ ἐπὶ λίθων τυχεῖν κείμενον. 

When Onesicritus came, he was lying upon stones. 

προσιὼν οὖν καὶ προσαγορεύσας εἰπεῖν ἔφη, διότι πεμφθείη παρὰ τοῦ βασιλέως ἀκροασόμενος τῆς σοφίας αὐτῶν καὶ ἀπαγγελῶν πρὸς αὐτόν: εἰ οὖν μηδεὶς εἴη φθόνος, ἕτοιμος εἴη μετασχεῖν τῆς ἀκροάσεως. 

Onesicritus approached, accosted him, and told him that he had been sent by the king, who had heard the fame of his wisdom, and that he was to give an account of his interview, if there were no objection, he was ready to listen to his discourse. 


ἰδόντα δ᾽ ἐκεῖνον χλαμύδα καὶ καυσίαν φοροῦντα καὶ κρηπῖδα, καταγελάσαντα ‘τὸ παλαιόν’ φάναι ‘πάντ᾽ ἦν ἀλφίτων καὶ ἀλεύρων πλήρη καθάπερ νῦν κόνεως: 

When Calanus saw his mantle, head-covering, and shoes, he laughed, and said, ‘Formerly, there was abundance everywhere of corn and barley, as there is now of dust; 

καὶ κρῆναι δ᾽ ἔρρεον αἱ μὲν ὕδατος γάλακτος δ᾽ ἄλλαι καὶ ὁμοίως μέλιτος, αἱ δ᾽ οἴνου τινὲς δ᾽ ἐλαίου: ὑπὸ πλησμονῆς δ᾽ οἱ ἄνθρωποι καὶ τρυφῆς εἰς ὕβριν ἐξέπεσον. 

fountains then flowed with water, milk, honey, wine, and oil, but mankind by repletion and luxury became proud and insolent. 

Ζεὺς δὲ μισήσας τὴν κατάστασιν ἠφάνισε πάντα καὶ διὰ πόνου τὸν βίον ἀπέδειξε: 

Jupiter, indignant at this state of things, destroyed all, and appointed for man a life of toil. 

σωφροσύνης δὲ καὶ τῆς ἄλλης [p. 997] ἀρετῆς παρελθούσης εἰς μέσον πάλιν εὐπορία τῶν ἀγαθῶν ὑπῆρξεν: 

On the reappearance of temperance and other virtues, there was again an abundance of good things. 

ἐγγὺς δ᾽ ἐστὶν ἤδη νυνὶ κόρου καὶ ὕβρεως τὸ πρᾶγμα, κινδυνεύει τε ἀφανισμὸς τῶν ὄντων γενέσθαι.’ 

But at present the condition of mankind approaches satiety and insolence, and there is danger lest the things which now exist should disappear.’


ταῦτα εἰπόντα κελεύειν, εἰ βούλοιτο ἀκροάσασθαι, καταθέμενον τὴν σκευὴν γυμνὸν ἐπὶ τῶν αὐτῶν λίθων κείμενον μετέχειν τῶν λόγων. 

When he had finished, he proposed to Onesicritus, if he wished to hear his discourse, to strip off his clothes, to lie down naked by him on the same stones, and in that manner to listen to him; 

ἀπορουμένου δὲ αὐτοῦ, Μάνδανιν ὅσπερ ἦν πρεσβύτατος καὶ σοφώτατος αὐτῶν, τὸν μὲν ἐπιπλῆξαι ὡς ὑβριστήν, καὶ ταῦτα ὕβρεως κατηγορήσαντα, 

while he was hesitating what to do, Mandanis,1 who was the oldest and wisest of the sophists, reproached Calanus for his insolence, although he censured such insolence himself. 

αὐτὸν δὲ προσκαλέσασθαι καὶ εἰπεῖν ὡς τὸν μὲν βασιλέα ἐπαινοίη, διότι ἀρχὴν τοσαύτην διοικῶν ἐπιθυμοίη σοφίας: μόνον γὰρ ἴδοι αὐτὸν ἐν ὅπλοις φιλοσοφοῦντα:  

Mandanis called Onesicritus to him, and said, I commend the king, because, although he governs so large an empire, he is yet desirous of acquiring wisdom, for he is the only philosopher in arms that I ever saw; 

ὠφελιμώτατον δ᾽ εἴη τῶν ἁπάντων, εἰ οἱ τοιοῦτοι φρονοῖεν οἷς πάρεστι δύναμις τοὺς μὲν ἑκουσίους πείθειν σωφρονεῖν τοὺς δ᾽ ἀκουσίους ἀναγκάζειν:

it would be of the greatest advantage, if those were philosophers who have the power of persuading the willing and of compelling the unwilling to learn temperance; 

αὐτῷ δὲ συγγνώμη εἴη, εἰ δι᾽ ἑρμηνέων τριῶν διαλεγόμενος πλὴν φωνῆς μηδὲν συνιέντων πλέον ἢ οἱ πολλοί, μηδὲν ἰσχύσει τῆς ὠφελείας ἐπίδειξιν ποιήσασθαι: 

but I am entitled to indulgence, if, when conversing by means of three interpreters, who, except the language, know no more than the vulgar, I am not able to demonstrate the utility of philosophy. 

ὅμοιον γὰρ ὡς ἂν εἰ διὰ βορβόρου καθαρὸν ἀξιοῖ τις ὕδωρ ῥεῖν.

To attempt it is to expect water to flow pure through mud.

1 By Arrian and Plutarch he is called Dandamis.
### 65
τὰ γοῦν λεχθέντα εἰς τοῦτ᾽ ἔφη συντείνειν ὡς εἴη λόγος ἄριστος, ὃς ἡδονὴν καὶ λύπην ψυχῆς ἀφαιρήσεται: καὶ ὅτι λύπη καὶ πόνος διαφέροι: τὸ μὲν γὰρ πολέμιον τὸ δὲ φίλιον αὐτοῖς τά γε σώματα ἀσκοῦσι πρὸς πόνον, ἵν᾽ αἱ γνῶμαι ῥωννύοιντο, ἀφ᾽ ὧν καὶ στάσεις παύοιεν καὶ σύμβουλοι πᾶσιν ἀγαθῶν παρεῖεν καὶ κοινῇ καὶ ἰδίᾳ: καὶ δὴ καὶ Ταξίλῃ νῦν συμβουλεύσειε δέχεσθαι τὸν Ἀλέξανδρον: 

‘The tendency of his discourse,’ he said, ‘was this, that the best philosophy was that which liberated the mind from pleasure and grief; that grief differed from labour, in that the former was inimical, the latter friendly to men; for that men exercised their bodies with labour in order to strengthen the mental powers, by which means they would be able to put an end to dissensions, and give good counsel to all, to the public and to individuals; that he certainly should at present advise Taxiles to receive Alexander as a friend; 

κρείττω μὲν γὰρ αὐτοῦ δεξάμενον εὖ πείσεσθαι, χείρω δὲ εὖ διαθήσειν. 

for if he entertained a person better than himself, he might be improved; but if a worse person, he might dispose him to good.’



ταῦτ᾽ εἰπόντα ἐξερέσθαι εἰ καὶ ἐν τοῖς Ἕλλησι λόγοι τοιοῦτοι λέγοιντο, 

After this Mandanis inquired, whether such doctrines were taught among the Greeks. 

εἰπόντος δ᾽ ὅτι καὶ Πυθαγόρας τοιαῦτα λέγοι κελεύοι τε ἐμψύχων ἀπέχεσθαι, καὶ Σωκράτης καὶ [p. 998] Διογένης οὗ καὶ αὐτὸς ἀκροάσαιτο, 

Onesicritus answered, that Pythagoras taught a similar doctrine, and enjoined his disciples to abstain from whatever has life; that Socrates and Diogenes, whose discourses he had heard, held the same opinions. 

ἀποκρίνασθαι ὅτι τἆλλα μὲν νομίζοι φρονίμως αὐτοῖς δοκεῖν, ἓν δ᾽ ἁμαρτάνειν νόμον πρὸ τῆς φύσεως τιθεμένους: οὐ γὰρ ἂν αἰσχύνεσθαι γυμνοὺς ὥσπερ αὐτὸν διάγειν ἀπὸ λιτῶν ζῶντας: καὶ γὰρ οἰκίαν ἀρίστην εἶναι ἥτις ἂν ἐπισκευῆς ἐλαχίστης δέηται: 

Mandanis replied, ‘that in other respects he thought them wise, but that in one thing they were mistaken, namely, in preferring custom to nature, for otherwise they would not be ashamed of going naked, like himself, and of subsisting on frugal fare; for the best house was that which required least repairs.’ 

ἔφη δ᾽ αὐτοὺς καὶ τῶν περὶ φύσιν πολλὰ ἐξετάσαι καὶ προσημασιῶν, ὄμβρων αὐχμῶν νόσων: 

He says also that they employ themselves much on natural subjects, as prognostics, rain, drought, and diseases. 

ἀπιόντας δ᾽ εἰς τὴν πόλιν κατὰ τὰς ἀγορὰς σκεδάννυσθαι: ὅτῳ δ᾽ ἂν κομίζοντι σῦκα ἢ βότρυς παρατύχωσι, λαμβάνειν δωρεὰν παρέχοντος: εἰ δ᾽ ἔλαιον εἴη, καταχεῖσθαι αὐτῶν καὶ ἀλείφεσθαι: 

When they repair to the city, they disperse themselves in the market-places; if they meet any one carrying figs or bunches of grapes, they take what is offered gratuitously; if it is oil, it is poured over them, and they are anointed with it. 

ἅπασαν δὲ πλουσίαν οἰκίαν ἀνεῖσθαι αὐτοῖς μέχρι γυναικωνίτιδος, εἰσιόντας δὲ δείπνου κοινωνεῖν καὶ λόγων. 

Every wealthy house, even to the women's apartment, is open to them; when they enter it, they engage in conversation, and partake of the repast. 

αἴσχιστον δ᾽ αὐτοῖς νομίζεσθαι νόσον σωματικήν: τὸν δ᾽ ὑπονοήσαντα καθ᾽ αὑτοῦ τοῦτο, ἐξάγειν ἑαυτὸν διὰ πυρὸς νήσαντα πυράν, 

Disease of the body they regard as most disgraceful, and he who apprehends it, after preparing a pyre, destroys himself by fire; 

ὑπαλειψάμενον δὲ καὶ καθίσαντα ἐπὶ τὴν πυρὰν ὑφάψαι κελεύειν, ἀκίνητον δὲ καίεσθαι.

he (previously) anoints himself, and sitting down upon it orders it to be lighted, remaining motionless while he is burning.

### 66
νέαρχος δὲ περὶ τῶν σοφιστῶν οὕτω λέγει: 

Nearchus gives the following account of the Sophists. 

τοὺς μὲν Βραχμᾶνας πολιτεύεσθαι καὶ παρακολουθεῖν τοῖς βασιλεῦσι συμβούλους, 

The Brachmanes engage in public affairs, and attend the kings as counsellors; 

τοὺς δ᾽ ἄλλους σκοπεῖν τὰ περὶ τὴν φύσιν, 

the rest are occupied in the study of nature. 

τούτων δ᾽ εἶναι καὶ Κάλανον: 

Calanus belonged to the latter class. 

συμφιλοσοφεῖν δ᾽ αὐτοῖς καὶ γυναῖκας, τὰς δὲ διαίτας ἁπάντων σκληράς. 

Women study philosophy with them, and all lead an austere life.


περὶ δὲ τῶν κατὰ τοὺς ἄλλους νομίμων τοιαῦτα ἀποφαίνεται: τοὺς μὲν νόμους ἀγράφους εἶναι, τοὺς μὲν κοινοὺς τοὺς δ᾽ ἰδίους, 

Of the customs of the other Indians, he says, that their laws, whether relating to the community or to individuals, are not committed to writing, and differ altogether from those of other people. 

ἀήθειαν ἔχοντας πρὸς τοὺς τῶν ἄλλων, οἷον τὸ τὰς παρθένους ἆθλον παρά τισι προκεῖσθαι τῷ πυγμὴν νικήσαντι ὥστ᾽ ἀπροίκους συνεῖναι: παρ᾽ ἄλλοις δὲ κατὰ συγγένειαν κοινῇ τοὺς καρποὺς ἐργασαμένους, ἐπὰν συγκομίσωσιν, αἴρεσθαι φορτίον ἕκαστον εἰς διατροφὴν τοῦ ἔτους, τὸν δ᾽ ἄλλον ἐμπιπράναι τοῦ ἔχειν εἰσαῦθις ἐργάζεσθαι καὶ μὴ [p. 999] ἀργὸν εἶναι. 

For example, it is the practice among some tribes, to propose virgins as prizes to the conquerors in a trial of skill in boxing; wherefore they marry without portions; among other tribes the ground is cultivated by families and in common; when the produce is collected, each takes a load sufficient for his subsistence during the year; the remainder is burnt, in order to have a reason for renewing their labour, and not remaining inactive. 

ὁπλισμὸν δ᾽ εἶναι τόξον καὶ οἰστοὺς τριπήχεις, ἢ σαύνιον, καὶ πέλτην καὶ μάχαιραν πλατεῖαν τρίπηχυν: ἀντὶ δὲ χαλινῶν φιμοῖς χρῆσθαι κημῶν μικρὸν διαφέρουσιν: ἥλοις δὲ τὰ χείλη διαπεπάρθαι.

Their weapons consist of a bow and arrows, which are three cubits in length, or a javelin, and a shield, and a sword three cubits long. Instead of bridles, they use muzzles,1 which differ little from a halter, and the lips are perforated with spikes.

1 By φιμοῖς, probably here is meant a circular segment, or band of iron, furnished with slightly raised points in the inside; it passes over the bone of the nose, and is fastened below by a cord which is continued as a bridle. Such a contrivance is still in use for mules and asses in the East.
### 70
φιλοσόφους τε τοῖς Βραχμᾶσιν ἀντιδιαιροῦνται Πράμνας, ἐριστικούς τινας καὶ ἐλεγκτικούς: 

Opposed to the Brachmanes there are philosophers, called Pramnæ, contentious people, and fond of argument. 

τοὺς δὲ Βραχμᾶνας φυσιολογίαν καὶ ἀστρονομίαν ἀσκεῖν, γελωμένους ὑπ᾽ ἐκείνων ὡς ἀλαζόνας καὶ ἀνοήτους. 

They ridicule the Brachmanes as boasters and fools for occupying themselves with physiology and astronomy. 

τούτων δὲ τοὺς μὲν ὀρεινοὺς καλεῖσθαι τοὺς δὲ γυμνήτας τοὺς δὲ πολιτικοὺς καὶ προσχωρίους: 

Some of the Pramnæ are called Pramnæ of the mountains, others Gymnetæ, others again are called Townsmen and Country- men. 

τοὺς μὲν ὀρεινοὺς δοραῖς ἐλάφων χρῆσθαι, πήρας δ᾽ ἔχειν ῥιζῶν καὶ φαρμάκων μεστάς, προσποιουμένους ἰατρικὴν μετὰ γοητείας καὶ ἐπῳδῶν καὶ περιάπτων. 

The Pramnæ of the mountains wear deer-skins, and carry scrips filled with roots and drugs; they profess to practise medicine by means of incantations, charms, and amulets.


τοὺς δὲ γυμνήτας κατὰ τοὔνομα γυμνοὺς διαζῆν, ὑπαιθρίους τὸ πλέον, καρτερίαν ἀσκοῦντας ἣν ἔφαμεν πρότερον μέχρι ἑπτὰ ἐτῶν καὶ τριάκοντα: γυναῖκας δὲ συνεῖναι μὴ μιγνυμένας αὐτοῖς: 

The Gymnetæ, as their name imports, are naked and live chiefly in the open air, practising fortitude for the space of thirty-seven years; this I have before mentioned; women live in their society, but without cohabitation. 

τούτους δὲ θαυμάζεσθαι

The Gymnetæ are held in singular estimation.

᾿αρτεμίδωρος δὲ τὸν Γάγγην φησὶν ἐκ τῶν Ἠμωδῶν ὀρῶν καταφερόμενον πρὸς νότον, ἐπειδὰν κατὰ τὴν Γάγγην γένηται πόλιν, ἐπιστρέφειν πρὸς ἕω μέχρι Παλιβόθρων καὶ τῆς εἰς τὴν θάλατταν ἐκβολῆς: τῶν δὲ συρρεόντων εἰς αὐτὸν * Οἰδάνην τινὰ καλεῖ: τρέφειν δὲ καὶ κροκοδείλους καὶ δελφῖνας: λέγει δὲ καὶ ἄλλα τινά, συγκεχυμένως δὲ καὶ ἀργῶς, ὧν οὐ φροντιστέον. προσθείη δ᾽ ἄν τις τούτοις καὶ τὰ παρὰ τοῦ Δαμασκηνοῦ Νικολάου.

Artemidorus says that the Ganges descends from the Emoda mountains and proceeds towards the south; when it arrives at the city Ganges,1 it turns to the east, and keeps this direction as far as Palibothra,2 and the mouth by which it discharges itself into the sea. He calls one of the rivers which flow into it Œdanes,3 which breeds crocodiles and dolphins. Some other circumstances besides are mentioned by him, but in so confused and negligent a manner that they are not to be regarded. To these accounts may be added that of Nicolaus Damascenus.

1 Not far from the present Anopschir on the Ganges, south-east from Delhi. Groskurd.

2 Patalputer, b. ii. c. i. § 9.

3 Probably the Iomanes.

φησὶ γὰρ οὗτος ἐν Ἀντιοχείᾳ τῇ ἐπὶ Δάφνῃ παρατυχεῖν τοῖς Ἰνδῶν πρέσβεσιν ἀφιγμένοις παρὰ Καίσαρα τὸν Σεβαστόν: οὓς ἐκ μὲν τῆς ἐπιστολῆς πλείους δηλοῦσθαι, σωθῆναι δὲ τρεῖς μόνους, οὓς ἰδεῖν φησι, τοὺς δ᾽ ἄλλους ὑπὸ μήκους τῶν ὁδῶν διαφθαρῆναι τὸ πλέον: τὴν δ᾽ ἐπιστολὴν ἑλληνίζειν ἐν διφθέρᾳ γεγραμμένην, δηλοῦσαν ὅτι Πῶρος εἴη ὁ γράψας, ἑξακοσίων δὲ ἄρχων βασιλέων ὅμως περὶ πολλοῦ ποιοῖτο φίλος εἶναι Καίσαρι, καὶ ἕτοιμος εἴη δίοδόν τε παρέχειν ὅπῃ βούλεται καὶ συμπράττειν ὅσα καλῶς ἔχει. ταῦτα μὲν ἔφη λέγειν τὴν ἐπιστολήν, τὰ δὲ κομισθέντα δῶρα προσενεγκεῖν ὀκτὼ οἰκέτας γυμνούς, ἐν περιζώμασι καταπεπασμένους ἀρώμασιν: εἶναι δὲ τὰ δῶρα τόν τε ἑρμᾶν, ἀπὸ τῶν ὤμων ἀφῃρημένον ἐκ νηπίου τοὺς βραχίονας, ὃν καὶ ἡμεῖς εἴδομεν, καὶ ἐχίδνας μεγάλας καὶ ὄφιν πηχῶν δέκα καὶ χελώνην ποταμίαν τρίπηχυν πέρδικά τε μείζω γυπός. συνῆν δέ, ὥς [p. 1003] φησι, καὶ ὁ Ἀθήνησι κατακαύσας ἑαυτόν: ποιεῖν δὲ τοῦτο τοὺς μὲν ἐπὶ κακοπραγίᾳ ζητοῦντας ἀπαλλαγὴν τῶν παρόντων, τοὺς δ᾽ ἐπ᾽ εὐπραγίᾳ, καθάπερ τοῦτον: ἅπαντα γὰρ κατὰ γνώμην πράξαντα μέχρι νῦν ἀπιέναι δεῖν, μή τι τῶν ἀβουλήτων χρονίζοντι συμπέσοι: καὶ δὴ καὶ γελῶντα ἁλέσθαι γυμνὸν λίπ᾽ ἀληλιμμένον ἐν περιζώματι ἐπὶ τὴν πυράν: ἐπιγεγράφθαι δὲ τῷ τάφῳ ‘Ζαρμανοχηγὰς Ἰνδὸς ἀπὸ Βαργόσης κατὰ τὰ πάτρια Ἰνδῶν ἔθη ἑαυτὸν ἀπαθανατίσας κεῖται.’

This writer states that at Antioch, near Daphne,1 he met with ambassadors from the Indians, who were sent to Augustus Cæsar. It appeared from the letter that several persons were mentioned in it, but three only survived, whom he says he saw. The rest had died chiefly in consequence of the length of the journey. The letter was written in Greek upon a skin; the import of it was, that Porus was the writer, that although he was sovereign of six hundred kings, yet that he highly esteemed the friendship of Cæsar; that he was willing to allow him a passage through his country, in whatever part he pleased, and to assist him in any undertaking that was just.

Eight naked servants, with girdles round their waists, and fragrant with perfumes, presented the gifts which were brought. The presents were a Hermes (i. e. a man) born without arms, whom I have seen, large snakes, a serpent ten cubits in length, a river tortoise of three cubits in length, and a partridge (?) larger than a vulture. They were accompanied by the person, it is said, who burnt himself to death at Athens. This is the practice with persons in distress, who seek escape from existing calamities, and with others in prosperous circumstances, as was the case with this man. For as everything hitherto had succeeded with him, he thought it necessary to depart, lest some unexpected calamity should happen to him by continuing to live; with a smile, therefore, naked, anointed, and with the girdle round his waist, he leaped upon the pyre. On his tomb was this inscription,—ZARMANOCHEGAS,2 AN INDIAN, A NATIVE OF BARGOSA,3 HAVING IMMORTALIZED HIMSELF ACCORDING TO THE CUSTOM OF HIS COUNTRY, HERE LIES.

1 A subordinate town in the pachalic of Aleppo, and its modern name is still Antakieh. It was anciently distinguished as Antioch by the Orontes, because it was situated on the left bank of that river, where its course turns abruptly to the west, after running northwards between the ranges of Lebanon and Antilebanon, and also Antioch by Daphne, because of the celebrated grove of Daphne which was consecrated to Apollo, in the immediate neighbourhood.

2 In Dion Cassius, liv. ix. he is called Zarmanus, a variation probably of Garmanus, see above, § 60. Chegas, or Sheik, seems to be the Tartar title Chan or Khan, which may be detected also in the names Musi-canus, Porti-canus, Oxy-canus, Assa-canus. Vincent, Voyage of Nearchus, p. 129. Groskurd writes Zarmanos Chanes.

3 Bargosa is probably a corruption of Barygaza mentioned in Arrian's Periplus of the Red Sea. It was a large mart on the north of the river Nerbudda, now Baroatsch or Barutsch. Groskurd.
