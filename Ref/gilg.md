1.	
. . . . . Belesu, he despised Belesu
2.	
like a bull his country he ascended after him
3.	
he destroyed him, and his memorial perished
4.	
the country was subdued, and after he took the crown
5.	
Izdubar put on his crown, and after he took the crown
6.	
for the favor of Izdubar, the princess Ishtar lifted her eyes.
7.	
And she spake thus, "Izdubar thou shalt be husband
8.	
thy word me shall bind in bonds,
9.	
thou shalt be husband and I will be thy wife,
10.	
thou shalt drive in a chariot of Ukni stone and gold,
11.	
of which its body is gold and splendid its pole
12.	
thou shalt ride in days of great glory
13.	
to Bitani, in which is the country where the pine trees grow.
14.	
Bitani at thy entrance
15.	
to the Euphrates shall kiss thy feet.
16.	
There shall be in subjection under thee, kings, lords, and princes.
17.	
The tribute of the mountains and plains they shall bring to thee, taxes

18.	
. . . . . . . they shall give thee, thy herds and flocks shall bring forth twins
19.	
. . . . . . . the mule shall be swift
20.	
. . . . . . . in the chariot shall be strong and not weak
21.	
. . . . . . . in the yoke. A rival shall not be permitted.
