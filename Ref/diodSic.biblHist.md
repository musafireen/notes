δεύτερον δὲ μυθολογοῦσι γενέσθαι Διόνυσον ἐκ Διὸς καὶ Φερσεφόνης, ὡς δέ τινες, ἐκ Δήμητρος. τοῦτον δὲ παρεισάγουσι πρῶτον βοῦς ὑπ᾽ ἄροτρον ζεῦξαι, τὸ πρὸ τοῦ ταῖς χερσὶ τῶν ἀνθρώπων τὴν γῆν κατεργαζομένων. πολλὰ δὲ καὶ ἄλλα φιλοτέχνως ἐπινοῆσαι τῶν πρὸς τὴν γεωργίαν χρησίμων, δι᾽ [p. 371] ὧν ἀπολυθῆναι τοὺς ὄχλους τῆς πολλῆς κακοπαθείας:

secondly, according to mythology, Dionysus was born from Zeus and Persephone, as you say, from Demeter. And this they bring forth the first bush under the ploughshare, that before the hands of men tilling the earth. but many others are artistically invented useful for agriculture, by [p. 371] in which he dismisses the mobs of much evil:

ἀνθ᾽ ὧν τοὺς εὖ παθόντας ἀπονεῖμαι τιμὰς ἰσοθέους αὐτῷ καὶ θυσίας, προθύμως ἁπάντων ἀνθρώπων διὰ τὸ μέγεθος τῆς εὐεργεσίας ἀπονειμάντων τὴν ἀθανασίαν. παράσημον δ᾽ αὐτῷ ποιῆσαι κέρατα τοὺς κατασκευάζοντας τὰς γραφὰς ἢ τοὺς ἀνδριάντας, ἅμα μὲν δηλοῦντας ἑτέραν Διονύσου φύσιν, ἅμα δὲ ἀπὸ τῆς περὶ τὸ ἄροτρον εὑρέσεως ἐμφαίνοντας τὸ μέγεθος τῆς ἐπινοηθείσης τοῖς γεωργοῖς εὐχρηστίας.

Because I bestow on those who have suffered an honor equal to him and a sacrifice, willingly all men for the greatness of the beneficence bestow immortality. as a sign of him, you make horns by making the scriptures or the andriands, if not by declaring a different nature to Dionysus, but by the discovery about the plow showing the magnitude of the convenience invented for the farmers.

[p. 376]

not at all, in many places of the worldly remnant of the god, signs of his own beneficence and presence, it is not a paradox that each of them thinks of the intimacy of what happened to Dionysus towards their own city and country. and the poet also testifies to those who have been told about us in the hymns, speaking about those who doubt this birth and if they are born, he mentions it in the Arabian Nysa, For those who are with Drakan, those who are with Icarus are the wind fas', the d' in Naxos, of the genus, erafiòta, The two are deep on the river Alpheus Cysamenen Semele tekeien Diὶ terpikeraunῳ, others in Thebes, another, say you are born, liars: to the father of men and gods Many of the people hide in the white sky. ἔsti de tis Nysis, the highest mountain, end of Phoenice, almost Egypt.

Cadmon with the gar fashi Agenorus from Phoenicia is sent by the king to request Europe, with the order that he either take the virgin or not return to Phoenicia. but having come to many countries, and not being strong enough, he refuses to take her home: having said that, in Boeotia, according to the oracle delivered, you are building Thebes.

μυθολογοῦσι δέ τινες καὶ ἕτερον Διόνυσον γεγονέναι πολὺ τοῖς χρόνοις προτεροῦντα τούτου. φασὶ γὰρ ἐκ Διὸς καὶ Φερσεφόνης Διόνυσον γενέσθαι τὸν ὑπό τινων Σαβάζιον ὀνομαζόμενον, οὗ τήν τε γένεσιν καὶ τὰς θυσίας καὶ τιμὰς νυκτερινὰς καὶ [p. 399] κρυφίους παρεισάγουσι διὰ τὴν αἰσχύνην τὴν ἐκ τῆς συνουσίας ἐπακολουθοῦσαν.

Mythologising, you and another Dionysus happened much earlier than this. for from Zeus and Persephone was born Dionysus, who was named after them Savazius, from whom also the sacrifices and nightly honors were born and [p. 399] they brought Cyplians because of the violence they followed from intercourse.

they say, let them dispose of it with stinging nettles, and first try to marry them, and by means of these they will produce the seed of the fruits: whence they shall also bring him in. and the one who was born from Semele in recent times was born tender and completely gentle, and in the decency of others they conducted many events favorable to aphrodisiac pleasures, and according to the hosts of women they were surrounded by prostrate ones don't be fooled.

αὐτὸς δ᾽ ἐγκυκλωθεὶς τὸν Ἀδρίαν καὶ πεζῇ περιελθὼν τὸν προειρημένον κόλπον κατήντησεν εἰς τὴν Ἤπειρον, ἐξ ἧς πορευθεὶς εἰς τὴν Πελοπόννησον, καὶ τετελεκὼς τὸν δέκατον ἆθλον, ἔλαβε πρόσταγμα παρ᾽ Εὐρυσθέως τὸν ἐξ ᾄδου Κέρβερον πρὸς τὸ φῶς ἀγαγεῖν. πρὸς δὲ τοῦτον τὸν ἆθλον ὑπολαβὼν συνοίσειν αὑτῷ, παρῆλθεν εἰς τὰς Ἀθήνας καὶ μετέσχε τῶν [p. 436] ἐν Ἐλευσῖνι μυστηρίων, Μουσαίου τοῦ Ὀρφέως υἱοῦ τότε προεστηκότος τῆς τελετῆς.

But when Heracles had made the circuit of the Adriatic, and had journeyed around the gulf on foot, he came to Epirus, whence he made his way to Peloponnesus. And now that he had performed the tenth Labour he received a Command from Eurystheus to bring Cerberus up from Hades to the light of day. And assuming that it would be to  p425 his advantage for the accomplishment of this Labour, he went to Athens and took part in the Eleusinian Mysteries, Musaeus, the son of Orpheus, being at that time in charge of the initiatory rites.
### 2 
ἐπεὶ δ᾽ Ὀρφέως ἐμνήσθημεν, οὐκ ἀνοίκειόν ἐστι παρεκβάντας βραχέα περὶ αὐτοῦ διελθεῖν. οὗτος γὰρ ἦν υἱὸς μὲν Οἰάγρου, Θρᾷξ δὲ τὸ γένος, παιδείᾳ δὲ καὶ μελῳδίᾳ καὶ ποιήσει πολὺ προέχων τῶν μνημονευομένων: καὶ γὰρ ποίημα συνετάξατο θαυμαζόμενον καὶ τῇ κατὰ τὴν ᾠδὴν εὐμελείᾳ διαφέρον. ἐπὶ τοσοῦτο δὲ προέβη τῇ δόξῃ ὥστε δοκεῖν τῇ μελῳδίᾳ θέλγειν τά τε θηρία καὶ τὰ δένδρα.

Since we have mentioned Orpheus it will not be inappropriate for us in passing to speak briefly about him. He was the son of Oeagrus, a Thracian by birth, and in culture and song-music and poesy he far surpassed all men of whom we have a record; for he composed a poem which was an object of wonder and excelled in its melody when it was sung. And his fame grew to such a degree that men believed that with his music he held a spell over both the wild beasts and the trees.

4 Ὅτι Πυθαγόρας πυθόμενος Φερεκύδην τὸν ἐπιστάτην αὐτοῦ γεγενημένον ἐν Δήλῳ νοσεῖν καὶ τελέως ἐσχάτως ἔχειν, ἔπλευσεν ἐκ τῆς Ἰταλίας εἰς τὴν Δῆλον. ἐκεῖ δὲ χρόνον ἱκανὸν τὸν ἄνδρα γηροτροφήσας, πᾶσαν εἰσηνέγκατο σπουδὴν ὥστε τὸν πρεσβύτην ἐκ τῆς νόσου διασῶσαι. κατισχυθέντος δὲ τοῦ Φερεκύδου διὰ2 γῆρας καὶ διὰ τὸ μέγεθος τῆς νόσου, περιέστειλεν αὐτὸν κηδεμονικῶς, καὶ τῶν νομιζομένων ἀξιώσας ὡσανεί τις υἱὸς πατέρα πάλιν ἐπανῆλθεν3 εἰς τὴν Ἰταλίαν.

4 Pythagoras, learning that his old teacher Pherecydes lay ill in Delos and was at the point of death, set sail from Italy to Delos. There he took care of the old man for a considerable time and made every effort to bring the aged man safely through his malady. And when Pherecydes was overcome by his advanced years and the severity of the disease, Pythagoras made every provision for his burial, and after performing the accustomed rites for him, as a son would for his father, he returned to Italy.

5 Ὅτι ἐπειδάν τινες τῶν συνήθων ἐκ τῆς οὐσίας ἐκπέσοιεν, διῃροῦντο τὰ χρήματα αὑτῶν4 ὡς πρὸς ἀδελφούς. οὐ μόνον δὲ πρὸς τοὺς καθ’ ἡμέραν συμβιοῦντας τῶν γνωρίμων τοιαύτην εἶχον τὴν διάθεσιν, ἀλλὰ καθόλου πρὸς πάντας τοὺς τῶν πραγμάτων τούτων μετασχόντας.

5 Whenever any of the companions of Pythagoras lost their fortune, the rest would divide their own possessions with them as with brothers. Such a disposition of their property they made, not only with their acquaintances who passed their daily lives with them, but also, speaking generally, with all who shared in their projects.

Ὅτι Κλεινίας, Ταραντῖνος τὸ γένος, εἷς δὲ τῶν ἐκ τοῦ προειρημένου συστήματος ὤν, πυθόμενος Πρῶρον τὸν Κυρηναῖον διά τινα πολιτικὴν περίστασιν ἀπολωλεκότα τὴν οὐσίαν καὶ τελέως ἀπορούμενον, ἐξεδήμησεν ἐκ τῆς Ἰταλίας εἰς Κυρήνην μετὰ χρημάτων ἱκανῶν καὶ τὴν οὐσίαν ἀποκατέστησε τῷ προειρημένῳ, οὐδέποτε τοῦτον ἑωρακώς, ἀκούων δὲ μόνον ὅτι Πυθαγόρειος ἦν.

Cleinias of Tarentum, who was a member of the order6 of which we have spoken, learning that Prorus of Cyrene had lost his fortune because of a political upheaval and was completely impoverished, went over from Italy to Cyrene with sufficient funds and restored to Prorus his fortune, although he had never seen the man before and knew no more of him than that he was a Pythagorean. 

### 2 
καὶ ἄλλοι δὲ πολλοὶ τὸ παραπλήσιον πεποιηκότες διαμνημονεύονται. οὐ μόνον δὲ ἐν τῇ τῶν χρημάτων ἐπιδόσει τοιούτοις αὑτοὺς παρείχοντο τοῖς γνωρίμοις, ἀλλὰ καὶ κατὰ τοὺς ἐπισφαλεστάτους καιροὺς συνεκινδύνευον. 

2 Of many others also it is recorded that they have done something of this kind. And it was not only in the giving away of money that they showed themselves so devoted to their friends, but they also shared each other's dangers on occasions of greatest peril. 
### 3 
καὶ γὰρ Διονυσίου τυραννοῦντος Φιντίας τις Πυθαγόρειος ἐπιβεβουλευκὼς τῷ τυράννῳ, μέλλων δὲ τῆς τιμωρίας τυγχάνειν, ᾐτήσατο παρὰ τοῦ Διονυσίου χρόνον εἰς τὸ περὶ τῶν ἰδίων πρότερον ἃ βούλεται διοικῆσαι· δώσειν δ’ ἔφησεν ἐγγυητὴν τοῦ θανάτου τῶν φίλων ἕνα. 

3 So, for example, while Dionysius was tyrant7 and a certain Phintias, a Pythagorean, who had formed a plot against the tyrant, was about to suffer the penalty for it, he asked Dionysius for time in which to make such disposition as he wished of his private affairs; and he said that he would give one of his friends as surety for his death. 
 
### 4 
τοῦ δὲ δυνάστου θαυμάσαντος, εἰ τοιοῦτός ἐστι φίλος ὃς ἑαυτὸν εἰς τὴν εἱρκτὴν ἀντ’ ἐκείνου παραδώσει, προσεκαλέσατό5 τινα τῶν γνωρίμων ὁ Φιντίας, Δάμωνα ὄνομα, Πυθαγόρειον φιλόσοφον, ὃς οὐδὲ διστάσας ἔγγυος εὐθὺς ἐγενήθη τοῦ θανάτου.

4 And when the ruler expressed his wonder whether such a friend was to be found as would take his place in prison, Phintias called upon one of his acquaintances, a Pythagorean philosopher named Damon, who without hesitation came forward at once as surety for his death.

### 5 
Τινὲς μὲν οὖν ἐπῄνουν τὴν ὑπερβολὴν τῆς πρὸς τοὺς φίλους εὐνοίας, τινὲς δὲ τοῦ ἐγγύου προπέτειαν καὶ μανίαν κατεγίνωσκον. πρὸς δὲ τὴν τεταγμένην ὥραν ἅπας ὁ δῆμος συνέδραμεν, καραδοκῶν εἰ φυλάξει τὴν πίστιν ὁ καταστήσας. 

5 Now there were some who expressed approval of so great a love for one's friends, whereas some charged the surety with rashness and folly. And at the appointed hour all the people ran together, anxious to learn whether the man who had provided a surety for himself would keep faith. 
### 6 
ἤδη δὲ τῆς ὥρας συγκλειούσης πάντες μὲν ἀπεγίνωσκον,  p58 ὁ δὲ Φιντίας ἀνελπίστως ἐπὶ τῆς ἐσχάτης τοῦ χρόνου ῥοπῆς δρομαῖος ἦλθε, τοῦ Δάμωνος ἀπαγομένου πρὸς τὴν ἀνάγκην. θαυμαστῆς δὲ τῆς φιλίας φανείσης ἅπασιν, ἀπέλυσεν ὁ Διονύσιος τῆς τιμωρίας τὸν ἐγκαλούμενον, καὶ παρεκάλεσε τοὺς ἄνδρας τρίτον ἑαυτὸν εἰς τὴν φιλίαν προσλαβέσθαι.

6 When the hour drew close and all were giving up hope, Phintias unexpectedly  p59 arrived on the run at the last moment, just as Damon was being led off to his fate. Such a friendship was in the eyes of all men a thing of wonder, and Dionysius remitted the punishment of the condemned man, urging the two men to include himself as a third in their friendship.8

and he, with his friends, went to the temples through the river, swimming on the Meridian Ocean. but the greater part of the force marches across the river, preceded by Crater and Hephaestion. when they came to the confluence of the Akesinus and Hydaspus, you disembarked the soldiers and advanced on the named Sibus.

these are the descendants of those who fought with Heracleus on the Aornon stone and of those who failed in the siege, and who lived in this place after Heracleus. of Alexander the Great, encamped near the city, the first of the citizens came in glory. And having pleased the king and the kinship, renewing all the poems, they ate willingly as if they were relatives and presented magnificent gifts.

ὁ δὲ Ἀλέξανδρος ἀποδεξάμενος αὐτῶν τὴν εὔνοιαν καὶ τὰς πόλεις ἀποδείξας ἐλευθέρας προῆγεν ἐπὶ τὰ συνορίζοντα τῶν ἐθνῶν. καταλαβὼν δὲ τοὺς ὀνομαζομένους Ἀγαλασσεῖς ἠθροικότας πεζοὺς μὲν τετρακισμυρίους, ἱππεῖς δὲ τρισχιλίους, συνάψας αὐτοῖς μάχην καὶ νικήσας τοὺς μὲν πλείστους κατέκοψεν, τοὺς δὲ λοιποὺς συμφυγόντας εἰς τὰς πλησίον πόλεις ἐκπολιορκήσας ἐξηνδραποδίσατο.

But Alexander, having accepted their favor and the cities he proved free, advanced to the frontiers of the nations. But when you came upon the people called Agalassies, assembling footmen with four thousand men, and three thousand horsemen, you entered into battle with them, and having defeated most of them, you put them to death, but the rest, fleeing to the neighboring cities, you besieged and surrendered.

4

And of the other countrymen, who had gathered billions, he took refuge in a great city according to the state, and of the four Indians, who barricaded the narrows and from the houses fighting fiercely, he hurriedly drove off not a few of the Macedonians.

5
διὰ δὲ τὴν ὀργὴν ἐμπρήσας τὴν πόλιν συγκατέκαυσε τοὺς πλείστους· τῶν δʼ ἐγχωρίων τῶν ὑπολειπομένων εἰς τρισχιλίους συμφυγόντας εἰς τὴν ἀκρόπολιν καὶ μεθʼ ἱκετηριῶν δεηθέντας ἀπέλυσεν.
