But now that we have examined these matters, we must enumerate what Greeks, who have won fame for their wisdom and learning, visited Egypt in ancient times, in order to become acquainted with its customs and learning. 
### 2 
οἱ γὰρ ἱερεῖς τῶν Αἰγυπτίων ἱστοροῦσιν ἐκ τῶν ἀναγραφῶν τῶν ἐν ταῖς ἱεραῖς βίβλοις παραβαλεῖν πρὸς ἑαυτοὺς τὸ παλαιὸν Ὀρφέα τε καὶ Μουσαῖον καὶ Μελάμποδα καὶ Δαίδαλον, πρὸς δὲ τούτοις Ὅμηρόν τε τὸν ποιητὴν καὶ Λυκοῦργον τὸν Σπαρτιάτην, ἔτι δὲ Σόλωνα τὸν Ἀθηναῖον καὶ Πλάτωνα τὸν φιλόσοφον, ἐλθεῖν δὲ καὶ Πυθαγόραν τὸν Σάμιον καὶ τὸν μαθηματικὸν Εὔδοξον, ἔτι δὲ Δημόκριτον τὸν Ἀβδηρίτην καὶ Οἰνοπίδην τὸν Χῖον.

For the priests of Egypt recount from the records of their sacred books that they were visited in early times by Orpheus, Musaeus, Melampus, and Daedalus, also by the poet Homer and Lycurgus of Sparta, later by Solon of Athens and the philosopher Plato, and that there also came Pythagoras of Samos and the mathematician Eudoxus,52 as well as Democritus of Abdera and Oenopides53 of Chios. 

### 3 
As evidence for the visits of all these men they point in some cases to their statues and in others to places or buildings54 which bear their names, and they offer proofs from the branch of learning which each one of these men pursued, arguing that all the things for which they were admired among the Greeks were transferred from Egypt.

4 Orpheus, for instance, brought from Egypt most of his mystic ceremonies, the orgiastic rites that accompanied his wanderings, and his fabulous account of his experiences in Hades. 5 For the rite of Osiris is the same as that of Dionysus and that of Isis very similar to that of Demeter, the names alone having been interchanged; and the punishments in Hades of the unrighteous, the Fields of the Righteous, and the fantastic conceptions, current among the  p329 many, which are figments of the imagination — all these were introduced by Orpheus in imitation of the Egyptian funeral customs. 6 Hermes, for instance, the Conductor of Souls, according to the ancient Egyptian custom, brings up the body of the Apis to a certain point and then gives it over to one who wears the mask of Cerberus. And after Orpheus had introduced this notion among the Greeks, Homer55 followed it when he wrote:

Cyllenian Hermes then did summon forth

The suitors's souls, holding his wand in hand.

And again a little further56 on he says:

They passed Oceanus' streams, the Gleaming Rock,

The Portals of the Sun, the Land of Dreams;

And now they reached the Meadow of Asphodel,

Where dwell the Souls, the shades of men outworn.

7 Now he calls the river "Oceanus"57 because in their language the Egyptians speak of the Nile as Oceanus; the "Portals of the Sun" (Heliopulai) is his name for the city of Heliopolis; and "Meadows," the mythical dwelling of the dead, is his term for the place near the lake which is called Acherousia, which is near Memphis, and around it are fairest meadows, of a marsh-land and lotus and reeds. The same explanation also serves for the statement that the dwelling of the dead is in these regions, since the most and the largest tombs of the Egyptians are situated there, the  p331 dead being ferried across both the river and Lake Acherousia and their bodies laid in the vaults situated there.

8 The other myths about Hades, current among the Greeks, also agree with the customs which are practised even now in Egypt. For the boat which receives the bodies is called baris,58 and the passenger's fee is given to the boatman, who in the Egyptian tongue is called charon. 9 And near these regions, they say, are also the "Shades," which is a temple of Hecate, and "portals" of Cocytus and Lethe, which are covered at intervals with bands of bronze.59 There are, moreover, other portals, namely, those of Truth, and near them stands a headless statue60 of Justice.

## c97
1 Many other things as well, of which mythology tells, are still to be found among the Egyptians, the name being still preserved and the customs actually being practised. 

2 In the city of Acanthi, for instance, across the Nile in the direction of Libya one hundred and twenty stades from Memphis, there is a perforated jar to which three hundred and sixty priests, one each day, bring water from the Nile;61 

3 and not far from there the actual performance of the myth of Ocnus62 is to be seen in one of their festivals, where a single man is weaving at one end of a long  p333 rope and many others beyond him are unravelling it. 

### 4 
Μελάμποδα δέ φασι μετενεγκεῖν ἐξ Αἰγύπτου τὰ Διονύσῳ νομιζόμενα τελεῖσθαι παρὰ τοῖς Ἕλλησι καὶ τὰ περὶ Κρόνου μυθολογούμενα καὶ τὰ περὶ τῆς Τιτανομαχίας καὶ τὸ σύνολον τὴν περὶ τὰ πάθη τῶν θεῶν ἱστορίαν.

Melampus also, they say, brought from Egypt the rites which the Greeks celebrate in the name of Dionysus, the myths about Cronus and the War with the Titans, and, in a word, the account of the things which happened to the gods. 

### 5 
Daedalus, they relate, copied the maze of the Labyrinth which stands to our day and was built, according to some, by Mendes,63 but according to others, by king Marrus, many years before the reign of Minos. 

6 And the proportions of the ancient statues of Egypt are the same as in those made by Daedalus among the Greeks. The very beautiful propylon of the temple of Hephaestus in Memphis was also built by Daedalus, who became an object of admiration and was granted a statue of himself in wood, which was made by his own hands and set up in this temple; furthermore, he was accorded great fame because of his genius and, after making many discoveries, was granted divine honours; for on one of the islands off Memphis there stands even to this day a temple of Daedalus, which is honoured by the people of that region.

7 And as proof of the presence of Homer in Egypt they adduce various pieces of evidence, and especially the healing drink which brings forgetfulness of all past evils, which was given by Helen to Telemachus in the home of Menelaüs. For it is manifest that the poet had acquired exact knowledge of the "nepenthic"64 drug which he says Helen brought from Egyptian Thebes, given her by Polydamna the  p335 wife of Thon; for, they allege, even to this day the women of this city use this powerful remedy, and in ancient times, they say, a drug to cure anger and sorrow was discovered exclusively among the women of Diospolis; but Thebes and Diospolis, they add, are the same city. 

8 Again, Aphroditê is called "golden"65 by the natives in accordance with an old tradition, and near the city which is called Momemphis there is a plain "of golden Aphroditê." 

9 Likewise, the myths which are related about the dalliance of Zeus and Hera and of their journey to Ethiopia he also got from Egypt; for each year among the Egyptians the shrine of Zeus is carried across the river into Libya and then brought back some days later, as if the god were arriving from Ethiopia; and as for the dalliance of these deities, in their festal gatherings the priests carry the shrines of both to an elevation that has been strewn with flowers of every description.66

δεύτερον δὲ μυθολογοῦσι γενέσθαι Διόνυσον ἐκ Διὸς καὶ Φερσεφόνης, ὡς δέ τινες, ἐκ Δήμητρος. τοῦτον δὲ παρεισάγουσι πρῶτον βοῦς ὑπ᾽ ἄροτρον ζεῦξαι, τὸ πρὸ τοῦ ταῖς χερσὶ τῶν ἀνθρώπων τὴν γῆν κατεργαζομένων. πολλὰ δὲ καὶ ἄλλα φιλοτέχνως ἐπινοῆσαι τῶν πρὸς τὴν γεωργίαν χρησίμων, δι᾽ [p. 371] ὧν ἀπολυθῆναι τοὺς ὄχλους τῆς πολλῆς κακοπαθείας:

secondly, according to mythology, Dionysus was born from Zeus and Persephone, as you say, from Demeter. And this they bring forth the first bush under the ploughshare, that before the hands of men tilling the earth. but many others are artistically invented useful for agriculture, by [p. 371] in which he dismisses the mobs of much evil:

Because I bestow on those who have suffered an honor equal to him and a sacrifice, willingly all men for the greatness of the beneficence bestow immortality. as a sign of him, you make horns by making the scriptures or the andriands, if not by declaring a different nature to Dionysus, but by the discovery about the plow showing the magnitude of the convenience invented for the farmers.

[p. 376]

not at all, in many places of the worldly remnant of the god, signs of his own beneficence and presence, it is not a paradox that each of them thinks of the intimacy of what happened to Dionysus towards their own city and country. and the poet also testifies to those who have been told about us in the hymns, speaking about those who doubt this birth and if they are born, he mentions it in the Arabian Nysa, For those who are with Drakan, those who are with Icarus are the wind fas', the d' in Naxos, of the genus, erafiòta, The two are deep on the river Alpheus Cysamenen Semele tekeien Diὶ terpikeraunῳ, others in Thebes, another, say you are born, liars: to the father of men and gods Many of the people hide in the white sky. ἔsti de tis Nysis, the highest mountain, end of Phoenice, almost Egypt.

for this is the one about Dionysus and the Amazons, and the one about the Argonauts and the deeds done during the Iliak war and many other things are composed, quoting the poems of the ancients, mythologists and poets.

Cadmon with the gar fashi Agenorus from Phoenicia is sent by the king to request Europe, with the order that he either take the virgin or not return to Phoenicia. but having come to many countries, and not being strong enough, he refuses to take her home: having said that, in Boeotia, according to the oracle delivered, you are building Thebes. And when I was born with Harmony, Aphrodite, from her was born Semelin %5 and Inos and Autonoin and Agavin, because

μυθολογοῦσι δέ τινες καὶ ἕτερον Διόνυσον γεγονέναι πολὺ τοῖς χρόνοις προτεροῦντα τούτου. φασὶ γὰρ ἐκ Διὸς καὶ Φερσεφόνης Διόνυσον γενέσθαι τὸν ὑπό τινων Σαβάζιον ὀνομαζόμενον, οὗ τήν τε γένεσιν καὶ τὰς θυσίας καὶ τιμὰς νυκτερινὰς καὶ [p. 399] κρυφίους παρεισάγουσι διὰ τὴν αἰσχύνην τὴν ἐκ τῆς συνουσίας ἐπακολουθοῦσαν.

Mythologising, you and another Dionysus happened much earlier than this. for from Zeus and Persephone was born Dionysus, who was named after them Savazius, from whom also the sacrifices and nightly honors were born and [p. 399] they brought Cyplians because of the violence they followed from intercourse.

αὐτὸς δ᾽ ἐγκυκλωθεὶς τὸν Ἀδρίαν καὶ πεζῇ περιελθὼν τὸν προειρημένον κόλπον κατήντησεν εἰς τὴν Ἤπειρον, ἐξ ἧς πορευθεὶς εἰς τὴν Πελοπόννησον, καὶ τετελεκὼς τὸν δέκατον ἆθλον, ἔλαβε πρόσταγμα παρ᾽ Εὐρυσθέως τὸν ἐξ ᾄδου Κέρβερον πρὸς τὸ φῶς ἀγαγεῖν. πρὸς δὲ τοῦτον τὸν ἆθλον ὑπολαβὼν συνοίσειν αὑτῷ, παρῆλθεν εἰς τὰς Ἀθήνας καὶ μετέσχε τῶν [p. 436] ἐν Ἐλευσῖνι μυστηρίων, Μουσαίου τοῦ Ὀρφέως υἱοῦ τότε προεστηκότος τῆς τελετῆς.

But when Heracles had made the circuit of the Adriatic, and had journeyed around the gulf on foot, he came to Epirus, whence he made his way to Peloponnesus. And now that he had performed the tenth Labour he received a Command from Eurystheus to bring Cerberus up from Hades to the light of day. And assuming that it would be to  p425 his advantage for the accomplishment of this Labour, he went to Athens and took part in the Eleusinian Mysteries, Musaeus, the son of Orpheus, being at that time in charge of the initiatory rites.

Since we have mentioned Orpheus it will not be inappropriate for us in passing to speak briefly about him. He was the son of Oeagrus, a Thracian by birth, and in culture and song-music and poesy he far surpassed all men of whom we have a record; for he composed a poem which was an object of wonder and excelled in its melody when it was sung. And his fame grew to such a degree that men believed that with his music he held a spell over both the wild beasts and the trees.

4 Pythagoras, learning that his old teacher Pherecydes lay ill in Delos and was at the point of death, set sail from Italy to Delos. There he took care of the old man for a considerable time and made every effort to bring the aged man safely through his malady. And when Pherecydes was overcome by his advanced years and the severity of the disease, Pythagoras made every provision for his burial, and after performing the accustomed rites for him, as a son would for his father, he returned to Italy.

5 Whenever any of the companions of Pythagoras lost their fortune, the rest would divide their own possessions with them as with brothers. Such a disposition of their property they made, not only with their acquaintances who passed their daily lives with them, but also, speaking generally, with all who shared in their projects.

Cleinias of Tarentum, who was a member of the order6 of which we have spoken, learning that Prorus of Cyrene had lost his fortune because of a political upheaval and was completely impoverished, went over from Italy to Cyrene with sufficient funds and restored to Prorus his fortune, although he had never seen the man before and knew no more of him than that he was a Pythagorean.

καὶ ἄλλοι δὲ πολλοὶ τὸ παραπλήσιον πεποιηκότες διαμνημονεύονται. οὐ μόνον δὲ ἐν τῇ τῶν χρημάτων ἐπιδόσει τοιούτοις αὑτοὺς παρείχοντο τοῖς γνωρίμοις, ἀλλὰ καὶ κατὰ τοὺς ἐπισφαλεστάτους καιροὺς συνεκινδύνευον. 

2 Of many others also it is recorded that they have done something of this kind. And it was not only in the giving away of money that they showed themselves so devoted to their friends, but they also shared each other's dangers on occasions of greatest peril. 
### 3 
καὶ γὰρ Διονυσίου τυραννοῦντος Φιντίας τις Πυθαγόρειος ἐπιβεβουλευκὼς τῷ τυράννῳ, μέλλων δὲ τῆς τιμωρίας τυγχάνειν, ᾐτήσατο παρὰ τοῦ Διονυσίου χρόνον εἰς τὸ περὶ τῶν ἰδίων πρότερον ἃ βούλεται διοικῆσαι· δώσειν δ’ ἔφησεν ἐγγυητὴν τοῦ θανάτου τῶν φίλων ἕνα. 

3 So, for example, while Dionysius was tyrant7 and a certain Phintias, a Pythagorean, who had formed a plot against the tyrant, was about to suffer the penalty for it, he asked Dionysius for time in which to make such disposition as he wished of his private affairs; and he said that he would give one of his friends as surety for his death. 
 
### 4 
τοῦ δὲ δυνάστου θαυμάσαντος, εἰ τοιοῦτός ἐστι φίλος ὃς ἑαυτὸν εἰς τὴν εἱρκτὴν ἀντ’ ἐκείνου παραδώσει, προσεκαλέσατό5 τινα τῶν γνωρίμων ὁ Φιντίας, Δάμωνα ὄνομα, Πυθαγόρειον φιλόσοφον, ὃς οὐδὲ διστάσας ἔγγυος εὐθὺς ἐγενήθη τοῦ θανάτου.

4 And when the ruler expressed his wonder whether such a friend was to be found as would take his place in prison, Phintias called upon one of his acquaintances, a Pythagorean philosopher named Damon, who without hesitation came forward at once as surety for his death.

### 5 
Τινὲς μὲν οὖν ἐπῄνουν τὴν ὑπερβολὴν τῆς πρὸς τοὺς φίλους εὐνοίας, τινὲς δὲ τοῦ ἐγγύου προπέτειαν καὶ μανίαν κατεγίνωσκον. πρὸς δὲ τὴν τεταγμένην ὥραν ἅπας ὁ δῆμος συνέδραμεν, καραδοκῶν εἰ φυλάξει τὴν πίστιν ὁ καταστήσας. 

5 Now there were some who expressed approval of so great a love for one's friends, whereas some charged the surety with rashness and folly. And at the appointed hour all the people ran together, anxious to learn whether the man who had provided a surety for himself would keep faith. 
### 6 
ἤδη δὲ τῆς ὥρας συγκλειούσης πάντες μὲν ἀπεγίνωσκον,  p58 ὁ δὲ Φιντίας ἀνελπίστως ἐπὶ τῆς ἐσχάτης τοῦ χρόνου ῥοπῆς δρομαῖος ἦλθε, τοῦ Δάμωνος ἀπαγομένου πρὸς τὴν ἀνάγκην. θαυμαστῆς δὲ τῆς φιλίας φανείσης ἅπασιν, ἀπέλυσεν ὁ Διονύσιος τῆς τιμωρίας τὸν ἐγκαλούμενον, καὶ παρεκάλεσε τοὺς ἄνδρας τρίτον ἑαυτὸν εἰς τὴν φιλίαν προσλαβέσθαι.

6 When the hour drew close and all were giving up hope, Phintias unexpectedly  p59 arrived on the run at the last moment, just as Damon was being led off to his fate. Such a friendship was in the eyes of all men a thing of wonder, and Dionysius remitted the punishment of the condemned man, urging the two men to include himself as a third in their friendship.8

these are the descendants of those who fought with Heracleus on the Aornon stone and of those who failed in the siege, and who lived in this place after Heracleus. of Alexander the Great, encamped near the city, the first of the citizens came in glory. And having pleased the king and the kinship, renewing all the poems, they ate willingly as if they were relatives and presented magnificent gifts.

But Alexander, having accepted their favor and the cities he proved free, advanced to the frontiers of the nations. But when you came upon the people called Agalassies, assembling footmen with four thousand men, and three thousand horsemen, you entered into battle with them, and having defeated most of them, you put them to death, but the rest, fleeing to the neighboring cities, you besieged and surrendered.

And of the other countrymen, who had gathered billions, he took refuge in a great city according to the state, and of the four Indians, who barricaded the narrows and from the houses fighting fiercely, he hurriedly drove off not a few of the Macedonians.

but because of his anger he set the city on fire and burned most of them; of the two villages, the remaining three thousand fled to the citadel and dismissed them with petitions.

τοῦ δὲ στόλου προσπλέοντος τῷ ξένῳ καὶ παραδόξῳ τῆς παρουσίας πτοηθέντες καὶ τὴν διαβεβοημένην δόξαν τῶν Μακεδόνων καταπλαγέντες, ἔτι δὲ τῶν πρεσβυτέρων συμβουλευσάντων μὴ διαγωνίζεσθαι πεντήκοντα τοὺς ἐπιφανεστάτους πρεσβευτὰς ἐξαπέστειλαν, ἀξιοῦντες φιλανθρώπως αὐτοῖς προσενεχθῆναι.

and of the approaching fleet, frightened by the strangeness of the presence, and overwhelmed by the promised glory of the Macedonians, because of the elders who advised against competition, they sent fifty illustrious ambassadors, deserving of a friendly approach to them.

Ὅτι Βαττάκης τις ὄνομα ἧκε, φησιν, ἐκ Πεσσινοῦντος τῆς Φρυγίας, ἱερεὺς ὑπάρχων τῆς μεγάλης τῶν θεῶν μητρός. 

One Battaces, a priest of the goddess Rhea, came to Rome from Pessinus, a city of Phrygia. 

οὗτος κατὰ πρόσταγμα τῆς θεοῦ παρεῖναι φήσας 

He declared that he had come by command of the goddess, 

τοῖς ἄρχουσιν ἐνέτυχε καὶ τῇ συγκλήτῳ, λέγων τὸ ἱερὸν τῆς θεοῦ μεμιᾶνθαι, 

and he told the magistrates and senate that their temple was profaned, 

καὶ δεῖν αὐτῇ δημοσίᾳ καθαρμοὺς ἐπὶ τῆς Ῥώμης συντελεσθῆναι. 

and that a public expiation ought to be made in the name of the Romans. 

ἐφόρει δὲ ἐσθῆτα καὶ τὴν περὶ τὸ σῶμα ἄλλην κατασκευὴν ἐξηλλαγμένην καὶ ὑπὸ τῶν Ῥωμαίων ἐθῶν οὐκ ἐπιχωρουμένην· 

His clothing and the other ornaments of his body were very strange, and altogether unusual at Rome; 

χρυσοῦν τε γὰρ στέφανον εἶχεν ὑπερμεγέθη καὶ στολὴν ἀνθίνην διάχρυσον, βασιλικὴν ἀξίαν ἐπιφαίνουσαν. 2 

for he bore a golden crown of great size, and a flowered gown embroidered with gold, giving the appearance of royal rank. 2 

ποιησάμενος δὲ λόγους ἐπὶ τῶν ἐμβόλων ἐν τῷ δήμῳ καὶ τὸ πλῆθος εἰς δεισιδαιμονίαν ἐμβαλών, καταλύματος μὲν δημοσίου καὶ ξενίων ἠξιώθη, 

After he had spoken to the people from the rostra, and filled the people with religious awe, he was honoured with public lodgings and hospitality: 

τὸν δὲ στέφανον ἐκωλύθη φορεῖν ὑφ' ἑνὸς τῶν δημάρχων Αὔλου Πομπηίου. 

but he was forbidden to wear the crown by Aulus Pompeius, a tribune of the people. 

διά τινος δ' ἑτέρου δημάρχου προαχθεὶς ἐπὶ τὰ ἔμβολα καὶ περὶ τῆς εἰς τὸ ἱερὸν ἁγνείας ἐπερωτώμενος ἀποκρίσεις ἐποιεῖτο δεισιδαιμονίαν περιεχούσας. 

When another tribune brought him back to the rostra, and asked how the expiatory sacrifices should be made, his answers were full of religious fervour. 

καταστασιασθεὶς δὲ ὑπὸ τοῦ Πομπηίου καὶ μεθ' ὕβρεως ἀπαλλαγεὶς 

At length he was driven out by Pompeius' faction, with many scorns and insults. 

ἐπὶ τὴν κατάλυσιν οὐκέτι προεπορεύετο, 

He went back to his lodgings, and never ventured out after that, 

λέγων μὴ μόνον ἑαυτὸν ἀσεβῶς προπεπηλακίσθαι, ἀλλὰ καὶ τὴν θεόν. 3 

saying that they had dishonoured not only himself, but also the goddess. 3 

ὁ δὲ Πομπήιος παραχρῆμα μὲν λάβρῳ πυρετῷ συνεσχέθη, μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα ἄφωνος γενόμενος καὶ καταληφθεὶς κυναγχικῷ πάθει τριταῖος κατέστρεψε τὸν βίον, παρὰ τοῖς πολλοῖς ὑποληφθεὶς θείᾳ τινὶ προνοίᾳ ἀνθ' ὧν εἰς τὸν ἱερέα καὶ τὴν θεὸν ἐπλημμέλησεν τοῦ ζῆν ἐστερῆσθαι· σφόδρα γὰρ Ῥωμαῖοι δεισιδαιμονοῦσι. διόπερ ὁ Βαττάκης λαβὼν τὴν συγχώρησιν τῆς κατὰ τὴν ἱερὰν στολὴν κατασκευῆς καὶ τιμηθεὶς ἀξιολόγοις ξενίοις ὑπὸ πολλῶν ἀνδρῶν τε καὶ γυναικῶν προεπέμφθη τὴν ἐκ τῆς Ῥώμης ἐπάνοδον ποιούμενος.

Before long Pompeius fell into a high fever, and then had a quinsy, which took away his speech, and he died on the third day. The common people believed that his death was caused by divine providence, as a result of his profane and impious abuse of the goddess and her priest; for the Romans are extremely god-fearing. Therefore Battaces was honoured with many presents, and allowed to continue wearing his sacred vestments with all their ornaments; and when he left Rome to return home, he was escorted out of the city by a multitude of men and women.
