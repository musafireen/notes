#### ambapālīvatthu
The courtesan Ambapālī heard
Assosi kho ambapālī gaṇikā—
that the Buddha had arrived at Koṭigāma.
“bhagavā kira koṭigāmaṁ anuppatto”ti.
She had her best carriages harnessed, mounted one of them, and left Vesālī to visit the Buddha.
Atha kho ambapālī gaṇikā bhadrāni bhadrāni yānāni yojāpetvā bhadraṁ bhadraṁ yānaṁ abhiruhitvā bhadrehi bhadrehi yānehi vesāliyā niyyāsi bhagavantaṁ dassanāya. Variant: yojāpetvā bhadraṁ bhadraṁ yānaṁ → yojāpetvā bhadraṁ yānaṁ (bj, sya2ed, pts1ed)
She went by carriage as far as the ground would allow, dismounted, and then approached the Buddha on foot. After bowing down to the Buddha, she sat down,
Yāvatikā yānassa bhūmi, yānena gantvā, yānā paccorohitvā, pattikāva yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṁ abhivādetvā ekamantaṁ nisīdi.
and the Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened her with a teaching.
Ekamantaṁ nisinnaṁ kho ambapāliṁ gaṇikaṁ bhagavā dhammiyā kathāya sandassesi samādapesi samuttejesi sampahaṁsesi.
She then said to the Buddha,
Atha kho ambapālī gaṇikā bhagavatā dhammiyā kathāya sandassitā samādapitā samuttejitā sampahaṁsitā bhagavantaṁ etadavoca—
“Sir, please accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the Sangha of monks.”
“adhivāsetu me, bhante, bhagavā svātanāya bhattaṁ saddhiṁ bhikkhusaṅghenā”ti.
The Buddha consented by remaining silent.
Adhivāsesi bhagavā tuṇhībhāvena.
Knowing that he had consented, she got up from her seat, bowed down, circumambulated him with her right side toward him, and left.
Atha kho ambapālī gaṇikā bhagavato adhivāsanaṁ viditvā uṭṭhāyāsanā bhagavantaṁ abhivādetvā padakkhiṇaṁ katvā pakkāmi.
#### licchavīvatthu
The Licchavīs of Vesālī, too,
Assosuṁ kho vesālikā licchavī—
heard that the Buddha had arrived at Koṭigāma.
“bhagavā kira koṭigāmaṁ anuppatto”ti.
They had their best carriages harnessed, mounted one of them, and left Vesālī to visit the Buddha.
Atha kho vesālikā licchavī bhadrāni bhadrāni yānāni yojāpetvā bhadraṁ bhadraṁ yānaṁ abhiruhitvā bhadrehi bhadrehi yānehi vesāliyā niyyāsuṁ bhagavantaṁ dassanāya. Variant: niyyāsuṁ → nīsiṁsu (bj); niyyiṁsu (sya-all)
Some of them wore blue, with blue makeup, blue clothes, and blue ornaments, and likewise, some of them wore yellow, some red, and some white.
Appekacce licchavī nīlā honti nīlavaṇṇā nīlavatthā nīlālaṅkārā, appekacce licchavī pītā honti pītavaṇṇā pītavatthā pītālaṅkārā, appekacce licchavī lohitā honti lohitavaṇṇā lohitavatthā lohitālaṅkārā, appekacce licchavī odātā honti odātavaṇṇā odātavatthā odātālaṅkārā. Variant: lohitavaṇṇā lohitavatthā lohitālaṅkārā → lohitakavaṇṇā lohitakavatthā lohitakālaṅkārā (bj, sya-all)

When Ambapālī met the young Licchavīs, she turned her carriage around and drove up next to them, pole to pole, yoke to yoke, wheel to wheel, axle to axle.
Atha kho ambapālī gaṇikā daharānaṁ daharānaṁ licchavīnaṁ īsāya īsaṁ yugena yugaṁ cakkena cakkaṁ akkhena akkhaṁ paṭivaṭṭesi. Variant: paṭivaṭṭesi → paṭivattesi (bj, sya-all, mr)
The Licchavīs said, “What on earth are you doing?”
Atha kho te licchavī ambapāliṁ gaṇikaṁ etadavocuṁ—
“kissa, je ambapāli, daharānaṁ daharānaṁ licchavīnaṁ īsāya īsaṁ yugena yugaṁ cakkena cakkaṁ akkhena akkhaṁ paṭivaṭṭesī”ti? Variant: ambapāli, daharānaṁ daharānaṁ → amhākaṁ daharānaṁ daharānaṁ (bj, sya-all)
and she replied, “I’m doing it, Sirs, because I’ve invited the Buddha and the Sangha of monks for tomorrow’s meal!”
“Tathā hi pana mayā, ayyaputtā, svātanāya buddhappamukho bhikkhusaṅgho nimantito”ti.

“We’ll give you a hundred thousand for this meal, Ambapālī.”
“Dehi, je ambapāli, amhākaṁ etaṁ bhattaṁ satasahassenā”ti.

“Even if you gave me the whole of Vesālī and the adjoining countryside, I would not give you this meal.” Vesāliṁ sāhāraṁ, literally, “Vesālī with its support”. Sp 3.289: Sāhāraṁ dajjeyyāthāti sajanapadaṁ dadeyyātha, “Sāhāraṁ dajjeyyātha means you should give me (Vesālī) together with the country.”
“Sacepi me, ayyaputtā, vesāliṁ sāhāraṁ dajjeyyātha, neva dajjāhaṁ taṁ bhattan”ti.

The Licchavīs snapped their fingers in dismay, saying,
Atha kho te licchavī aṅguliṁ phoṭesuṁ—
“Damn it, we’ve been beaten by the mango woman!”
“jitamha vata bho ambakāya, parājitamha vata bho ambakāyā”ti. Variant: jitamha → parājitamha (bj, sya-all)
And they continued on their way to the Buddha.
Atha kho te licchavī yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkamiṁsu.

When the Buddha saw them coming, he said to the monks,
Addasā kho bhagavā te licchavī dūratova āgacchante, disvāna bhikkhū āmantesi—
“Those of you who haven’t seen the Tāvatiṁsa gods look at the Licchavīs.
“yehi, bhikkhave, bhikkhūhi devā tāvatiṁsā adiṭṭhapubbā, oloketha, bhikkhave, licchavīparisaṁ;
apaloketha, bhikkhave, licchavīparisaṁ;
The Licchavīs are similar to the Tāvatiṁsa gods.”
upasaṁharatha, bhikkhave, licchavīparisaṁ tāvatiṁsaparisan”ti.

ms3V_1314
The Licchavīs went by carriage as far as the ground would allow, dismounted, and then approached the Buddha on foot.
Atha kho te licchavī yāvatikā yānassa bhūmi, yānena gantvā yānā paccorohitvā pattikāva yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkamiṁsu;
After bowing down to the Buddha, they sat down,
upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṁ abhivādetvā ekamantaṁ nisīdiṁsu.
and the Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened them with a teaching.
Ekamantaṁ nisinne kho te licchavī bhagavā dhammiyā kathāya sandassesi samādapesi samuttejesi sampahaṁsesi.
They then said to the Buddha,
Atha kho te licchavī, bhagavatā dhammiyā kathāya sandassitā samādapitā samuttejitā sampahaṁsitā bhagavantaṁ etadavocuṁ—
“Sir, please accept tomorrow’s meal from us together with the Sangha of monks.”
“adhivāsetu no, bhante, bhagavā svātanāya bhattaṁ saddhiṁ bhikkhusaṅghenā”ti.

“I have already accepted tomorrow’s meal from Ambapālī.”
“Adhivuṭṭhomhi, licchavī, svātanāya ambapāliyā gaṇikāya bhattan”ti.

The Licchavīs snapped their fingers in dismay,
Atha kho te licchavī aṅguliṁ phoṭesuṁ—
saying, “Damn it, we’ve been beaten by the mango woman.”
“jitamha vata bho ambakāya, parājitamha vata bho ambakāyā”ti.
After rejoicing in the Buddha’s words, they got up from their seats, bowed down, circumambulated him with their right sides toward him, and left.
Atha kho te licchavī bhagavato bhāsitaṁ abhinanditvā anumoditvā uṭṭhāyāsanā bhagavantaṁ abhivādetvā padakkhiṇaṁ katvā pakkamiṁsu.

ms3V_1315
When the Buddha had stayed at Koṭigāma for as long as he liked, he went to Nātikā,
Atha kho bhagavā koṭigāme yathābhirantaṁ viharitvā yena nātikā tenupasaṅkami. Variant: nātikā → nādikā (si, sya-all); ñātikā (pts1ed); viharitvā → dn16:102 [Mahāparinibbānasutta/11. Ambapālīgaṇikā] mahāparinibbānasutte anusandhi aññathā
where he stayed in the brick guesthouse.
Tatra sudaṁ bhagavā nātike viharati giñjakāvasathe.

The following morning Ambapālī had various kinds of fine foods prepared in her own park. She then had the Buddha informed that the meal was ready.
Atha kho ambapālī gaṇikā tassā rattiyā accayena sake ārāme paṇītaṁ khādanīyaṁ bhojanīyaṁ paṭiyādāpetvā bhagavato kālaṁ ārocāpesi—“kālo, bhante, niṭṭhitaṁ bhattan”ti.
The Buddha robed up, took his bowl and robe, and went to Ambapālī’s meal offering where he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Sangha of monks.
Atha kho bhagavā pubbaṇhasamayaṁ nivāsetvā pattacīvaramādāya yena ambapāliyā gaṇikāya parivesanā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā paññatte āsane nisīdi saddhiṁ bhikkhusaṅghena.
Ambapālī personally served various kinds of fine foods to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha. When the Buddha had finished his meal, she sat down to one side and said,
Atha kho ambapālī gaṇikā buddhappamukhaṁ bhikkhusaṅghaṁ paṇītena khādanīyena bhojanīyena sahatthā santappetvā sampavāretvā bhagavantaṁ bhuttāviṁ onītapattapāṇiṁ ekamantaṁ nisīdi. Ekamantaṁ nisinnā kho ambapālī gaṇikā bhagavantaṁ etadavoca—
“Sir, I give this mango grove to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha.”
“imāhaṁ, bhante, ambavanaṁ buddhappamukhassa bhikkhusaṅghassa dammī”ti.
The Buddha accepted the park.
Paṭiggahesi bhagavā ārāmaṁ.
After instructing, inspiring, and gladdening her with a teaching, he got up from his seat and went to the Great Wood near Vesālī,
Atha kho bhagavā ambapāliṁ gaṇikaṁ dhammiyā kathāya sandassetvā samādapetvā samuttejetvā sampahaṁsetvā uṭṭhāyāsanā yena mahāvanaṁ tenupasaṅkami.
where he stayed in the hall with the peaked roof.
Tatra sudaṁ bhagavā vesāliyaṁ viharati mahāvane kūṭāgārasālāyaṁ.

At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary.
Tena samayena buddho bhagavā rājagahe viharati veḷuvane kalandakanivāpe.
At that time Vesālī was prosperous and crowded with people, and there was plenty of food.
Tena kho pana samayena vesālī iddhā ceva hoti phitā ca bahujanā ca ākiṇṇamanussā ca subhikkhā ca; Variant: phitā → phītā (sya-all, pts1ed)
There were seven thousand seven hundred and seven stilt houses,
satta ca pāsādasahassāni satta ca pāsādasatāni satta ca pāsādā;
and the same number of halls with peaked roofs,
satta ca kūṭāgārasahassāni satta ca kūṭāgārasatāni satta ca kūṭāgārāni;
parks,

and lotus ponds.
satta ca pokkharaṇīsahassāni satta ca pokkharaṇīsatāni satta ca pokkharaṇiyo;
And there was the courtesan Ambapālī who was attractive and gracious and had the most beautiful complexion. She was skilled at dancing, singing, and instrumental music. She was highly desired, charging fifty coins for a night.
ambapālī ca gaṇikā abhirūpā hoti dassanīyā pāsādikā paramāya vaṇṇapokkharatāya samannāgatā, padakkhiṇā nacce ca gīte ca vādite ca, abhisaṭā atthikānaṁ atthikānaṁ manussānaṁ paññāsāya ca rattiṁ gacchati; Variant: ambapālī ca → ambapālikā (pts1ed); padakkhiṇā → padakkhā (sya-all)
Because of her, Vesālī was even more splendid.
tāya ca vesālī bhiyyoso mattāya upasobhati.

On one occasion the householder association of Rājagaha traveled to Vesālī on business, Sp 3.326: Negamoti kuṭumbiyagaṇo, “Negama: a group of householders.” This definition is missing in DOP.
Atha kho rājagahako negamo vesāliṁ agamāsi kenacideva karaṇīyena. Variant: rājagahako → rājagahiko (bj)
and they saw all these marvelous qualities of the city,
Addasā kho rājagahako negamo vesāliṁ iddhañceva phitañca bahujanañca ākiṇṇamanussañca subhikkhañca;
satta ca pāsādasahassāni satta ca pāsādasatāni satta ca pāsāde;

Variant: padakkhiṇaṁ → padakkhaṁ (sya-all); upasobhantiṁ → upasobhitaṁ (bj); upasobhitanti (pts1ed)
ms3V_1559msdiv327
When they had concluded their business, they returned to Rājagaha.
Atha kho rājagahako negamo vesāliyaṁ taṁ karaṇīyaṁ tīretvā punadeva rājagahaṁ paccāgañchi.
They then went to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha
Yena rājā māgadho seniyo bimbisāro tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā rājānaṁ māgadhaṁ seniyaṁ bimbisāraṁ etadavoca—
and told him about everything they had seen,
“vesālī, deva, iddhā ceva phitā ca bahujanā ca ākiṇṇamanussā ca subhikkhā ca;
satta ca pāsādasahassāni …pe…
tāya ca vesālī bhiyyoso mattāya upasobhati.
adding, “Sir, please appoint a courtesan.”
Sādhu, deva, mayampi gaṇikaṁ vuṭṭhāpessāmā”ti. Variant: vuṭṭhāpessāmā”ti → vuṭṭhāpeyyāmāti (bj, sya-all, pts1ed, mr)

“Well then, find a suitable girl.”
“Tena hi, bhaṇe, tādisiṁ kumāriṁ jānātha yaṁ tumhe gaṇikaṁ vuṭṭhāpeyyāthā”ti.

ms3V_1560
At that time in Rājagaha there was a girl called Sālavatī who was attractive and gracious and had the most beautiful complexion,
Tena kho pana samayena rājagahe sālavatī nāma kumārī abhirūpā hoti dassanīyā pāsādikā paramāya vaṇṇapokkharatāya samannāgatā. Variant: kumārī → kumārikā (bj)
and the householder association appointed her as courtesan.
Atha kho rājagahako negamo sālavatiṁ kumāriṁ gaṇikaṁ vuṭṭhāpesi.
Soon afterwards she became skilled in dancing, singing, and instrumental music. She was highly desired, charging a hundred coins for a night.
Atha kho sālavatī gaṇikā nacirasseva padakkhiṇā ahosi nacce ca gīte ca vādite ca, abhisaṭā atthikānaṁ atthikānaṁ manussānaṁ paṭisatena ca rattiṁ gacchati.

Soon enough Sālavatī became pregnant.
Atha kho sālavatī gaṇikā nacirasseva gabbhinī ahosi.
She thought,
Atha kho sālavatiyā gaṇikāya etadahosi—
“Men don’t like pregnant women.
“itthī kho gabbhinī purisānaṁ amanāpā. Variant: amanāpā → amanāpā hoti (bj)
If anyone finds out about this,
Sace maṁ koci jānissati—
it will ruin my career.
sālavatī gaṇikā gabbhinīti, sabbo me sakkāro bhañjissati. Variant: sakkāro bhañjissati → parihāyissati (bj, sya-all, pts1ed)
Let me announce that I’m sick.”
Yannūnāhaṁ gilānaṁ paṭivedeyyan”ti.
She told her doorman,
Atha kho sālavatī gaṇikā dovārikaṁ āṇāpesi—
“Don’t allow any man to enter.
“mā, bhaṇe dovārika, koci puriso pāvisi.
If anyone asks for me, tell them I’m sick.”
Yo ca maṁ pucchati, ‘gilānā’ti paṭivedehī”ti.

“Yes, madam.”
“Evaṁ, ayye”ti kho so dovāriko sālavatiyā gaṇikāya paccassosi.

Her pregnancy progressed, and eventually she gave birth to a son.
Atha kho sālavatī gaṇikā tassa gabbhassa paripākamanvāya puttaṁ vijāyi.
She told her slave,
Atha kho sālavatī gaṇikā dāsiṁ āṇāpesi—
“Listen, take this boy away in a winnowing basket and throw him on the trash heap.”
“handa, je, imaṁ dārakaṁ kattarasuppe pakkhipitvā nīharitvā saṅkārakūṭe chaḍḍehī”ti.

Saying, “Yes, madam,” she did just that.
“Evaṁ, ayye”ti kho sā dāsī sālavatiyā gaṇikāya paṭissutvā taṁ dārakaṁ kattarasuppe pakkhipitvā nīharitvā saṅkārakūṭe chaḍḍesi.

ms3V_1561msdiv328
On the same morning, as Prince Abhaya was walking to an audience with the King, he saw that boy surrounded by crows. He asked his companions,
Tena kho pana samayena abhayo nāma rājakumāro kālasseva rājupaṭṭhānaṁ gacchanto addasa taṁ dārakaṁ kākehi samparikiṇṇaṁ, disvāna manusse pucchi— Variant: abhayo nāma rājakumāro → abhayo rājakumāro (bj)
“What’s that surrounded by crows?”
“kiṁ etaṁ, bhaṇe, kākehi samparikiṇṇan”ti?

“It’s a boy, sir.”
“Dārako, devā”ti.

“Is he alive?”
“Jīvati, bhaṇe”ti?

“Yes, he’s alive.”
“Jīvati, devā”ti.

“Well then, take him to our compound and give him to the wet-nurses to feed.”
“Tena hi, bhaṇe, taṁ dārakaṁ amhākaṁ antepuraṁ netvā dhātīnaṁ detha posetun”ti.

Saying, “Yes,” they did as requested.
“Evaṁ, devā”ti kho te manussā abhayassa rājakumārassa paṭissutvā taṁ dārakaṁ abhayassa rājakumārassa antepuraṁ netvā dhātīnaṁ adaṁsu—
“posethā”ti.

When they knew that he would live, they gave him the name Jīvaka, “Survivor”.
Tassa jīvatīti “jīvako”ti nāmaṁ akaṁsu.
And because a prince brought him up, they also gave him the name Komārabhacca, “Prince-reared”.
Kumārena posāpitoti “komārabhacco”ti nāmaṁ akaṁsu.

When Jīvaka reached the age of discernment,
Atha kho jīvako komārabhacco nacirasseva viññutaṁ pāpuṇi.
he went to Prince Abhaya and asked him,
Atha kho jīvako komārabhacco yena abhayo rājakumāro tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā abhayaṁ rājakumāraṁ etadavoca—
“Who, sir, are my mother and father?”
“kā me, deva, mātā, ko pitā”ti?

“I don’t know who your mother is,
“Ahampi kho te, bhaṇe jīvaka, mātaraṁ na jānāmi;
but I’m your father,
api cāhaṁ te pitā;
because I brought you up.”
mayāsi posāpito”ti. Variant: mayāsi → mayāpi (sya-all, pts1ed, mr)

On a later occasion Jīvaka thought,
Atha kho jīvakassa komārabhaccassa etadahosi—
“It’s not easy to make a living in a royal family without a profession.
“imāni kho rājakulāni na sukarāni asippena upajīvituṁ.
Why don’t I learn a profession?”
Yannūnāhaṁ sippaṁ sikkheyyan”ti.

ms3V_1562msdiv329
At that time the pre-eminent physician in the world was living at Takkasilā.
Tena kho pana samayena takkasilāyaṁ disāpāmokkho vejjo paṭivasati. Variant: takkasilāyaṁ → takkasīlāyaṁ (mr)
Then, without asking permission from Prince Abhaya, Jīvaka left for Takkasilā.
Atha kho jīvako komārabhacco abhayaṁ rājakumāraṁ anāpucchā yena takkasilā tena pakkāmi.
When he eventually arrived, he went to that physician and said,
Anupubbena yena takkasilā, yena vejjo tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā taṁ vejjaṁ etadavoca—
“Teacher, I wish to learn the profession.”
“icchāmahaṁ, ācariya, sippaṁ sikkhitun”ti.

“Well then, Jīvaka, please do so.”
“Tena hi, bhaṇe jīvaka, sikkhassū”ti.

Jīvaka learned much, and he learned quickly; he remembered well and did not forget.
Atha kho jīvako komārabhacco bahuñca gaṇhāti lahuñca gaṇhāti suṭṭhu ca upadhāreti, gahitañcassa na sammussati. Variant: na sammussati → na pamussati (bj, sya-all, pts1ed)
After seven years, Jīvaka thought,
Atha kho jīvakassa komārabhaccassa sattannaṁ vassānaṁ accayena etadahosi—
“I’m a good learner, and I’ve been studying for seven years.
“ahaṁ kho bahuñca gaṇhāmi lahuñca gaṇhāmi suṭṭhu ca upadhāremi, gahitañca me na sammussati, satta ca me vassāni adhīyantassa, nayimassa sippassa anto paññāyati.
And yet there’s no end in sight to learning this profession.”
Kadā imassa sippassa anto paññāyissatī”ti.

ms3V_1563
He went to that physician and told him what he had thought,
Atha kho jīvako komārabhacco yena so vejjo tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā taṁ vejjaṁ etadavoca—
“ahaṁ kho, ācariya, bahuñca gaṇhāmi lahuñca gaṇhāmi suṭṭhu ca upadhāremi, gahitañca me na sammussati, satta ca me vassāni adhīyantassa, nayimassa sippassa anto paññāyati.
adding, “When will I complete the training for this profession?”
Kadā imassa sippassa anto paññāyissatī”ti?

“Listen, Jīvaka. Take a spade and walk as far as 13 kilometers all around Takkasilā and bring back whatever plant you see that’s not medicinal.”
“Tena hi, bhaṇe jīvaka, khaṇittiṁ ādāya takkasilāya samantā yojanaṁ āhiṇḍitvā yaṁ kiñci abhesajjaṁ passeyyāsi taṁ āharā”ti.

Saying, “Yes, teacher,” he did just that. But he did not see any plant that was not medicinal.
“Evaṁ, ācariyā”ti kho jīvako komārabhacco tassa vejjassa paṭissutvā khaṇittiṁ ādāya takkasilāya samantā yojanaṁ āhiṇḍanto na kiñci abhesajjaṁ addasa.
He then went back to the physician and told him what had happened.
Atha kho jīvako komārabhacco yena so vejjo tenupasaṅkami, upasaṅkamitvā taṁ vejjaṁ etadavoca—
“āhiṇḍantomhi, ācariya, takkasilāya samantā yojanaṁ, na kiñci abhesajjaṁ addasan”ti. Variant: yojanaṁ, na kiñci → āhiṇṭanto na kiñci (mr)
The physician said, “You’re well-trained, Jīvaka.
“Susikkhitosi, bhaṇe jīvaka. Variant: Susikkhitosi → sikkhitosi (bj, sya-all, pts1ed)
It’s enough for you to live on.” And he gave Jīvaka a small amount of provisio
