ओमित्येतदक्षरमुद्गीथमुपासीत । ओमिति ह्युद्गायति तस्योपव्याख्यानम् ॥ १.१.१ ॥

Om is the closest word to Brahman. Recite this Om as if you are worshipping Brahman. [That is, treat this Om as the symbol of Brahman and concentrate on the idea of their oneness.] How you recite this Om is being explained.

देवासुरा ह वै यत्र संयेतिरे उभये प्राजापत्यास्तद्ध 

The gods and goddesses and the demons are both children of Prajāpati, yet they fought among themselves. 

देवा उद्गीथमाजह्रुरनेनैनानभिभविष्याम इति ॥ १.२.१ ॥

The gods and goddesses then adopted the path of the udgītha, thinking they would thereby be able to overcome the demons.
#### 2
ते ह नासिक्यं प्राणमुद्गीथमुपासांचक्रिरे 

The gods and goddesses worshipped the prāṇa presiding over the nostrils as udgītha. 

तं हासुराः पाप्मना विविधुस्तस्मात्तेनोभयं जिघ्रति सुरभि च दुर्गन्धि च पाप्मना ह्येष विद्धः ॥ १.२.२ ॥

The demons, however, misused it. [To them it was only an organ of smelling.] That is why [because of this misuse] people smell both good and bad odours through the nostrils.
#### 7
अथ ह य एवायं मुख्यः प्राणस्तमुद्गीथमुपासांचक्रिरे 

Next, the gods and goddesses worshipped the chief prāṇa as udgītha. 

तंहासुरा ऋत्वा विदध्वंसुर्यथाश्मानमाखणमृत्वा विध्वंसेतैवम् ॥ १.२.७ ॥

As regards the demons, they all met their end in prāṇa, just as [chunks of earth] break into pieces when they hit an unbreakable stone.
#### 8
यथाश्मानमाखणमृत्वा विध्वंसत एवं हैव 

Just as when chunks of earth are thrown against an unbreakable stone they are themselves reduced to dust, 

स विध्वंसते य एवंविदि पापं कामयते 

similarly, if anyone wishes ill or causes an injury to a person who knows prāṇa, he invites his own destruction thereby. 

यश्चैनमभिदासति स एषोऽश्माखणः ॥ १.२.८ ॥

The person who knows prāṇa is immune to injury like a piece of unbreakable stone.
#### 9
नैवैतेन सुरभि न दुर्गन्धि विजानात्यपहतपाप्मा ह्येष 

So far as the chief prāṇa is concerned, there is no good or bad odour for it. This is because it is pure [i.e., it is never touched by anything evil born of egotism]. 

तेन यदश्नाति यत्पिबति तेनेतरान्प्राणानवति 

If this prāṇa eats and drinks anything, it does so only to sustain the sense organs [such as the eyes, the ears, and so on]. 

एतमु एवान्ततोऽवित्त्वोत्क्रमति व्याददात्येवान्तत इति ॥

When death occurs, the chief prāṇa does not eat or drink anything [and as a result, the sense organs collapse]. They seem to have left the body. [They still want to eat and drink, however, so that they may live, and] this is indicated by the fact that a person dies with the mouth open.
#### 10
तं हाङ्गिरा उद्गीथमुपासांचक्र 

The sage Aṅgirā worshipped the chief prāṇa as udgītha [i.e., Brahman, to whom the udgītha is addressed]. 

एतमु एवाङ्गिरसं मन्यन्तेऽङ्गानां यद्रसः ॥ १.२.१० ॥

The chief prāṇa is referred to as āṅgirasa, for it is the rasa [i.e., the essence, or support] of all the aṅgas [organs].
#### 11
तेन तं ह बृहस्पतिरुद्गीथमुपासांचक्र 

This is why Bṛhaspati worshipped prāṇa as udgītha. 

एतमु एव बृहस्पतिं मन्यन्ते वाग्घि बृहती तस्या एष पतिः ॥

Prāṇa is regarded as Bṛhaspati, for vāk [speech] is great [bṛhatī] and prāṇa is its lord [pati].
#### 13
तेन तंह बको दाल्भ्यो विदांचकार । 

The sage Baka, son of Dalbha, came to know prāṇa as it was. 

स ह नैमिशीयानामुद्गाता बभूव स ह स्मैभ्यः कामानागायति ॥ १.२.१३ ॥

That is why the sages of Naimiṣa forest selected him as the singer of their udgītha. He, in his turn, fulfilled their wishes.
#### 14
आगाता ह वै कामानां भवति य एतदेवं विद्वानक्षरमुद्गीथमुपास्त 

If a person knows the real meaning of prāṇa and worships it as udgītha akṣara [i.e., as Akṣara Brahman] he himself becomes Akṣara Brahman. 

He then worships everyone he wants to worship [i.e., in singing for prāṇa he sings for all], and he attains all he desires. 

इत्यध्यात्मम् ॥ १.२.१४ ॥

This is the attainment on the level of the body [adhyātma]. [The inner attainment is that he becomes one with prāṇa—that is, Akṣara Brahman.]

The sage Ghora, of the family of Aṅgirasa, taught this truth to Kṛṣṇa, the son of Devakī. As a result, Kṛṣṇa became free from all desires. Then Ghora said: ‘At the time of death a person should repeat these three mantras: “You never decay, you never change, and you are the essence of life.”’ Here are two Ṛk mantras in this connection:

सत्यकामो ह जाबालो जबालां मातरमामन्त्रयांचक्रे ब्रह्मचर्यं भवति विवत्स्यामि किंगोत्रो न्वहमस्मीति ॥ ४.४.१ ॥

Once Satyakāma Jābāla said to his mother Jabālā: ‘Revered mother, I would like to live with a teacher as a celibate student. What is my lineage?’.

Gautama asked him, ‘O Somya, what is your lineage?’ Satyakāma said: ‘Sir, I do not know what my lineage is. When I asked my mother, she said to me: “I was very busy serving many people when I was young, and I had you. As this was the situation, I know nothing about your lineage. My name is Jabālā, and your name is Satyakāma.” So, sir, I am Satyakāma Jābāla’.

Gautama said to him: ‘No non-brāhmin could speak like this. [Therefore, you must be a brāhmin.] O Somya, go and get me some fuel [for the sacrificial fire]. I will initiate you [as a brāhmin by presenting you with the sacred thread], as you have not deviated from truth.’ After the initiation, he selected four hundred feeble and famished cows. Addressing Satyakāma, Gautama said, ‘O Somya, take these cows away [and look after them].’ As. Satyakāma was taking them away, he said, ‘I will not come back until there are a thousand of them.’ He lived away for many years until they had become a thousand.

Those who know this [about the five fires], and those who live in the forest practising austerities with faith—they go after death to the world of light. From the world of light they go to the world of day; from the world of day to the world of the bright fortnight; from the world of the bright fortnight to the six months when the sun moves northward;

On the other hand, those who live in the village and perform acts of public service, charity, and so on, attain the world of smoke. From there they go to the world of the night; from night they go to the world of the dark fortnight; and from the dark fortnight they go to the world of the six months when the sun moves to the south. This means that they never attain the world of the year.

Living in the world of the moon until the fruits of his work are exhausted, he then goes back to this world along the path he came. First going to the sky, he then goes to air. Having become air, he next becomes smoke. Having become smoke, he then becomes mist.

Having become mist, it changes into clouds. Then from clouds, it becomes rain and falls to the earth. Finally it grows as paddy, barley, plants, trees, sesame, beans, and so forth. The change from this state is very difficult. Those who eat these things produce children just like themselves.

Among them, those who did good work in this world [in their past life] attain a good birth accordingly. They are born as a brāhmin, a kṣatriya, or a vaiśya. But those who did bad work in this world [in their past life] attain a bad birth accordingly, being born as a dog, a pig, or as a casteless person.

But those who do not follow either of these two paths are born among small animals and insects again and again. [This can be said about those who are born in] this third state: ‘Be born and die.’ This is why the other world does not get filled up. Therefore one should despise this state. Here is a verse on the subject—

Uddālaka Āruṇi said to his son Śvetaketu: ‘O Somya, let me explain to you the concept of deep sleep. When a person is said to be sleeping, O Somya, he becomes one with Sat [Existence], and he attains his real Self. That is why people say about him, “He is sleeping.” He is then in his Self’.

Prajāpati once said: ‘The Self is free from sin, free from old age, free from death, free from sorrow, and free from hunger and thirst. It is the cause of desire for Truth and for commitment to Truth. This Self has to be sought for and thoroughly known. The person who has sought for and known the Self attains all worlds and all desires’.

Both the gods and the demons came to know from people what Prajāpati had said. They said, ‘We shall search for that Self, by knowing which we can attain all the worlds and whatever things we desire.’ With this object in view, Indra among the gods and Virocana among the demons went to Prajāpati, carrying fuel in their hands.

[Prajāpati said:] ‘Look at yourselves in a vessel full of water. If you have any doubts about the Self then let me know.’ They then looked at themselves in the water, and Prajāpati asked, ‘What do you see?’ They replied, ‘We see the reflection of our whole self, including even our hair and nails’.

The two of them said, ‘Revered sir, just as we are well-dressed in fine clothes, and neat and clean, in the same way, these two reflections are well-dressed in fine clothes, and neat and clean.’ Prajāpati said: ‘That is the Self. It is immortal and fearless. It is Brahman.’ The two of them left then, happy in mind.

Anyone among them, whether a god or a demon, who will understand the teaching this way [thinking the body to be the Self] will be lost.’ Virocana, the king of the demons, went back to the demons happy in mind and explained to them the upaniṣad:

This is why in this world even today people say, ‘Oh, he is a demon,’ if that person is devoid of the feeling of charity, has no respect for others, and never cares to perform a sacrifice, because the demons have the idea that the body is the Self. When a person dies they decorate the body with all kinds of offerings, new clothes, and jewellery, for they think that by this, the person will conquer the other world.

But even before Indra returned to the gods, a doubt arose in his mind: ‘When the body is well decorated, the reflection is also well decorated. When the body is in fine clothes, the reflection is also in fine clothes. When the body is neat and clean, the reflection is also neat and clean. Again, suppose a person is blind. Then the reflection will show a blind body. Or if the body is lame, the reflection will show a lame body. Or if the body is hurt in some way, the reflection will show the same. Then again, if the body is destroyed, the reflection is gone. I don’t see that anything good will come from this’.

It is Brahman.’ Indra left happy in mind. But even before he got back to the gods, he was troubled by a doubt: ‘When the self is in deep sleep, it is not able to recognize itself as “I am so-and-so,” as it does when it is awake. Not only that, it does not even recognize beings around it. It is as if the self has been obliterated. I don’t see that anything good will come from this’.

The total time Indra spent thus was one hundred and one years. This is what sages refer to when they say, ‘Indra lived with Prajāpati for one hundred and one years practising brahmacarya.’ Then Prajāpati said to him—

मघवन्मर्त्यं वा इदं शरीरमात्तं मृत्युना तदस्यामृतस्याशरीरस्यात्मनोऽधिष्ठानमात्तो वै सशरीरः प्रियाप्रियाभ्यां न वै सशरीरस्य सतः प्रियाप्रिययोरपहतिरस्त्यशरीरं वाव सन्तं न प्रियाप्रिये स्पृशतः ॥ ८.१२.१ ॥

Indra, this body is mortal. It has been captured by death. Yet it is the base of the Self, which is immortal and formless. One who has a body is subject to both happiness and unhappiness. In fact, there is no end to happiness and unhappiness so long as one has a body. But when a person is free from the body, nothing good or bad can touch him.

अशरीरो वायुरभ्रं विद्युत्स्तनयित्नुरशरीराण्येतानि तद्यथैतान्यमुष्मादाकाशात्समुत्थाय परं ज्योतिरुपसम्पद्य स्वेन रूपेणाभिनिष्पद्यन्ते ॥ ८.१२.२ ॥

The air is formless. So also are clouds, lightning, and thunder. All these arise from the sky and assume their respective forms due to the heat of the sun.

एवमेवैष सम्प्रसादोऽस्माच्छरीरात्समुत्थाय परं ज्योतिरुपसम्पद्य स्वेन रूपेणाभिनिष्पद्यते स उत्तमपुरुषः स तत्र पर्येति जक्षत्क्रीडन्रममाणः स्त्रीभिर्वा यानैर्वा ज्ञातिभिर्वा नोपजनं स्मरन्निदं शरीरं स यथा प्रयोग्य आचरणे युक्त एवमेवायमस्मिञ्छरीरे प्राणो युक्तः ॥ ८.१२.३ ॥

In the same way, the joyful self arises from the body and, attaining the light of the Cosmic Self, appears in his own form. This is the Paramātman, the Cosmic Self. He then freely moves about eating, playing, or enjoying himself with women, carriages, or relatives, not remembering at all the body in which he was born. Just as horses or bullocks are harnessed to carriages, similarly prāṇa [life] remains harnessed to the body [due to karma].

तं वा एतं देवा आत्मानमुपासते तस्मात्तेषां सर्वे च लोका आत्ताः सर्वे च कामाः स सर्वांश्च लोकानाप्नोति सर्वांश्च कामान्यस्तमात्मानमनुविद्य विजानातीति ह प्र्जापतिरुवाच प्रजापतिरुवाच ॥ ८.१२.६ ॥
॥ इति द्वादशः खण्डः ॥

This Self is worshipped by the gods. This is why all worlds and all desirable things are within their grasp. One who fully understands and realizes this Self [with the help of teachers and the scriptures] is able to attain whatever worlds and whatever desirable things he wants. This is what Prajāpati taught Indra.
