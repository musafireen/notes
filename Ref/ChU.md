ओमित्येतदक्षरमुद्गीथमुपासीत । ओमिति ह्युद्गायति तस्योपव्याख्यानम् ॥ १.१.१ ॥

Om is the closest word to Brahman. Recite this Om as if you are worshipping Brahman. [That is, treat this Om as the symbol of Brahman and concentrate on the idea of their oneness.] How you recite this Om is being explained.

देवासुरा ह वै यत्र संयेतिरे उभये प्राजापत्यास्तद्ध 

The gods and goddesses and the demons are both children of Prajāpati, yet they fought among themselves. 

देवा उद्गीथमाजह्रुरनेनैनानभिभविष्याम इति ॥ १.२.१ ॥

The gods and goddesses then adopted the path of the udgītha, thinking they would thereby be able to overcome the demons.
#### 2
ते ह नासिक्यं प्राणमुद्गीथमुपासांचक्रिरे 

The gods and goddesses worshipped the prāṇa presiding over the nostrils as udgītha. 

तं हासुराः पाप्मना विविधुस्तस्मात्तेनोभयं जिघ्रति सुरभि च दुर्गन्धि च पाप्मना ह्येष विद्धः ॥ १.२.२ ॥

The demons, however, misused it. [To them it was only an organ of smelling.] That is why [because of this misuse] people smell both good and bad odours through the nostrils.
#### 7
अथ ह य एवायं मुख्यः प्राणस्तमुद्गीथमुपासांचक्रिरे 

Next, the gods and goddesses worshipped the chief prāṇa as udgītha. 

तंहासुरा ऋत्वा विदध्वंसुर्यथाश्मानमाखणमृत्वा विध्वंसेतैवम् ॥ १.२.७ ॥

As regards the demons, they all met their end in prāṇa, just as [chunks of earth] break into pieces when they hit an unbreakable stone.
#### 8
यथाश्मानमाखणमृत्वा विध्वंसत एवं हैव 

Just as when chunks of earth are thrown against an unbreakable stone they are themselves reduced to dust, 

स विध्वंसते य एवंविदि पापं कामयते 

similarly, if anyone wishes ill or causes an injury to a person who knows prāṇa, he invites his own destruction thereby. 

यश्चैनमभिदासति स एषोऽश्माखणः ॥ १.२.८ ॥

The person who knows prāṇa is immune to injury like a piece of unbreakable stone.
#### 9
नैवैतेन सुरभि न दुर्गन्धि विजानात्यपहतपाप्मा ह्येष 

So far as the chief prāṇa is concerned, there is no good or bad odour for it. This is because it is pure [i.e., it is never touched by anything evil born of egotism]. 

तेन यदश्नाति यत्पिबति तेनेतरान्प्राणानवति 

If this prāṇa eats and drinks anything, it does so only to sustain the sense organs [such as the eyes, the ears, and so on]. 

एतमु एवान्ततोऽवित्त्वोत्क्रमति व्याददात्येवान्तत इति ॥

When death occurs, the chief prāṇa does not eat or drink anything [and as a result, the sense organs collapse]. They seem to have left the body. [They still want to eat and drink, however, so that they may live, and] this is indicated by the fact that a person dies with the mouth open.
#### 10
तं हाङ्गिरा उद्गीथमुपासांचक्र 

The sage Aṅgirā worshipped the chief prāṇa as udgītha [i.e., Brahman, to whom the udgītha is addressed]. 

एतमु एवाङ्गिरसं मन्यन्तेऽङ्गानां यद्रसः ॥ १.२.१० ॥

The chief prāṇa is referred to as āṅgirasa, for it is the rasa [i.e., the essence, or support] of all the aṅgas [organs].
#### 11
तेन तं ह बृहस्पतिरुद्गीथमुपासांचक्र 

This is why Bṛhaspati worshipped prāṇa as udgītha. 

एतमु एव बृहस्पतिं मन्यन्ते वाग्घि बृहती तस्या एष पतिः ॥

Prāṇa is regarded as Bṛhaspati, for vāk [speech] is great [bṛhatī] and prāṇa is its lord [pati].
#### 13
तेन तंह बको दाल्भ्यो विदांचकार । 

The sage Baka, son of Dalbha, came to know prāṇa as it was. 

स ह नैमिशीयानामुद्गाता बभूव स ह स्मैभ्यः कामानागायति ॥ १.२.१३ ॥

That is why the sages of Naimiṣa forest selected him as the singer of their udgītha. He, in his turn, fulfilled their wishes.
#### 14
आगाता ह वै कामानां भवति य एतदेवं विद्वानक्षरमुद्गीथमुपास्त 

If a person knows the real meaning of prāṇa and worships it as udgītha akṣara [i.e., as Akṣara Brahman] he himself becomes Akṣara Brahman. 

He then worships everyone he wants to worship [i.e., in singing for prāṇa he sings for all], and he attains all he desires. 

इत्यध्यात्मम् ॥ १.२.१४ ॥

This is the attainment on the level of the body [adhyātma]. [The inner attainment is that he becomes one with prāṇa—that is, Akṣara Brahman.]

The sage Ghora, of the family of Aṅgirasa, taught this truth to Kṛṣṇa, the son of Devakī. As a result, Kṛṣṇa became free from all desires. Then Ghora said: ‘At the time of death a person should repeat these three mantras: “You never decay, you never change, and you are the essence of life.”’ Here are two Ṛk mantras in this connection:

जानश्रुतिर्ह पौत्रायणः 

In ancient times there was a king who was the great-grandson of Janaśruta. 

श्रद्धादेयो बहुदायी 

He was a highly charitable person, who gave many gifts in charity, and always with due respect. 

बहुपाक्य आस 

He also had large quantities of food cooked for people. 

स ह सर्वत आवसथान्मापयांचक्रे सर्वत एव मेऽन्नमत्स्यन्तीति ॥ ४.१.१ ॥

With the thought in mind, ‘People all over will eat my food,’ he had many rest-houses built in different places.

The swan in front replied: ‘Say, who is this person? From the way you are talking one would think he was Raikva with the cart.’ Then the other swan asked, ‘And who is this Raikva with the cart you are referring to?’.
#### 4
यथा कृतायविजितायाधरेयाः संयन्त्येवमेनं सर्वं तदभिसमैति यत्किंच प्रजाः साधु कुर्वन्ति 

Just as in a game of dice, when a person wins the toss called kṛta he automatically wins the lower tosses also, in the same way, whatever good work people do goes to the credit of Raikva. 

यस्तद्वेद यत्स वेद स मयैतदुक्त इति ॥ ४.१.४ ॥

If anyone knows what Raikva knows, he becomes like Raikva. This is how I would describe Raikva.’

यदा वा अग्निरुद्वायति वायुमेवाप्येति 

When fire is extinguished, it disappears into the air. 

यदा सूर्योऽस्तमेति वायुमेवाप्येति 

When the sun sets, it disappears into the air.

When water dries up, it disappears into the air. 

वायुर्ह्येवैतान्सर्वान्संवृङ्क्त

This is the worship of the forces of nature (adhidaivata).
#### 8
तस्म उ ह ददुस्ते वा 

Then they gave him alms. 

एते पञ्चान्ये पञ्चान्ये दश 

The first five [Vāyu, etc.] and the second five [prāṇa, etc.] together make ten. 

सन्तस्तत्कृतं 

That is kṛta [the throw of dice of the highest denomination]. 

तस्मात्सर्वासु दिक्ष्वन्नमेव दश 

These ten are the ten directions, and they are the food. 

कृतं सैषा विराडन्नादी तयेदं सर्वं 

This kṛta is Virāṭ. As Virāṭ is all-pervasive, everything is its food. 

दृष्टं सर्वमस्येदं 

By that Virāṭ all this is seen. 

दृष्टं भवत्यन्नादो भवति य एवं वेद य एवं वेद ॥ ४.३.८ ॥

Gautama asked him, ‘O Somya, what is your lineage?’ Satyakāma said: ‘Sir, I do not know what my lineage is. When I asked my mother, she said to me: “I was very busy serving many people when I was young, and I had you. As this was the situation, I know nothing about your lineage. My name is Jabālā, and your name is Satyakāma.” So, sir, I am Satyakāma Jābāla’.

Gautama said to him: ‘No non-brāhmin could speak like this. [Therefore, you must be a brāhmin.] O Somya, go and get me some fuel [for the sacrificial fire]. I will initiate you [as a brāhmin by presenting you with the sacred thread], as you have not deviated from truth.’ After the initiation, he selected four hundred feeble and famished cows. Addressing Satyakāma, Gautama said, ‘O Somya, take these cows away [and look after them].’ As. Satyakāma was taking them away, he said, ‘I will not come back until there are a thousand of them.’ He lived away for many years until they had become a thousand.

Once Śvetaketu, the grandson of Aruṇa, went to the court of the Pañcālas. Pravāhaṇa, the son of Jīvala, asked him, ‘Young man, did your father teach you?’ [Śvetaketu replied:] ‘Yes, revered sir, he did’.

[Pravāhaṇa asked,] ‘Do you have any idea where, from this world, human beings go in heaven?’ ‘No, sir, I have no idea,’ [replied Śvetaketu]. ‘Do you know how they come back?’ ‘No, sir, I don’t.’ ‘Have you any idea where the two paths—the path of the gods and the path of the ancestors—part?’ ‘No, sir, I don’t know’.

[Pravāhaṇa asked,] ‘Do you know why the other world [the world of the moon] is not filled with people?’ [Śvetaketu replied,] ‘No, revered sir, I don’t know.’ ‘Do you know why after the fifth oblation water comes to be called “puruṣa” [man]?’ ‘No, sir, I don’t know’.

[Pravāhaṇa said:] ‘Why did you say then, “I have been taught”? How can one who does not know these things say, “I have been taught”?’ Śvetaketu was hurt. He went back to his father and said, ‘You have not really taught ṃe, yet you said, “I have taught you.”’.

[Śvetaketu said:] ‘That friend of the princes put five questions to me. I was not able to answer a single one of them.’ [He then told his father the five questions. After pondering over them for some time, his father] said: ‘Those questions you told me about on your return from the court—I am not able to answer even one of them.

Gautama then went to the king’s palace. On his arrival, the king welcomed him respectfully. The next morning, when the king was in his court, Gautama went there to meet him. The king said to him, ‘Revered Gautama, ask for a boon from me—anything a person might wish for.’ Gautama replied: ‘Let those things be with you. Please tell me whatever you said to my son.’ Hearing this, the king turned pale.

The king then issued orders that Gautama should stay with him for a long time [as a brahmacari. Gautama did that. One day] the king said to him: ‘O Gautama, regarding the matter which you asked about, no brāhmin before you had access to this knowledge. This is why in the past, in all the worlds, it was only the kṣatriyas who had the right to impart this knowledge.’ Having said this, he proceeded to teach Gautama.

[This can be said about those who are born in] this third state: ‘Be born and die.’ This is why the other world does not get filled up. Therefore one should despise this state. Here is a verse on the subject—

स्तेनो हिरण्यस्य सुरां पिबंश्च गुरोस्तल्पमावसन्ब्रह्महा चैते पतन्ति चत्वारः पञ्चमश्चाचरंस्तैरिति ॥ ५.१०.९ ॥

A person who steals gold, or drinks liquor, or goes to bed with his teacher’s wife, or kills a brāhmin—these four are lost. Also lost is the fifth—one who keeps company with such people.

Pṛthagvartmā [‘one who changes direction’—air] is the prāṇa; Bahula [‘pervasive’—space] is the middle part; Rayi [‘wealth’—water] is the bladder; 

पृथिव्येव पादावुर एव वेदिर्लोमानि बर्हिर्हृदयं गार्हपत्यो 

the earth [Pratiṣṭhā—‘the support’] is the feet; the sacrificial altar is the chest; the kuśa grass is the hair on the chest; the Gārhapatya fire is the heart; 

मनोऽन्वाहार्यपचन आस्यमाहवनीयः ॥ ५.१८.२ ॥

the Anvāhāryapacana [i.e., the Dakṣiṇāgni] fire is the mind; and the Āhavanīya fire is the mouth.

This is because in Brahmaloka, which is the third world from the earth, there are two oceans called Ara and Ṇya. There also one finds a lake called Airammadīya [so-called because its waters are intoxicating], a peepal tree always exuding soma juice, a city called Aparājitā [the Invincible] belonging to Brahmā, and a canopy of gold specially made by the Lord.

Prajāpati once said: ‘The Self is free from sin, free from old age, free from death, free from sorrow, and free from hunger and thirst.

Both the gods and the demons came to know from people what Prajāpati had said. They said, ‘We shall search for that Self, by knowing which we can attain all the worlds and whatever things we desire.’ With this object in view, Indra among the gods and Virocana among the demons went to Prajāpati, carrying fuel in their hands.

Prajāpati said to those two, ‘That which is seen in the eyes is the Self.’ He also said: ‘This Self is immortal and fearless.

[Prajāpati said:] ‘Look at yourselves in a vessel full of water. If you have any doubts about the Self then let me know.’ They then looked at themselves in the water, and Prajāpati asked, ‘What do you see?’ They replied, ‘We see the reflection of our whole self, including even our hair and nails’.

The two of them said, ‘Revered sir, just as we are well-dressed in fine clothes, and neat and clean, in the same way, these two reflections are well-dressed in fine clothes, and neat and clean.’ Prajāpati said: ‘That is the Self. It is immortal and fearless. It is Brahman.’ The two of them left then, happy in mind.

Seeing them leave, Prajāpati said to himself: ‘They are going without realizing or knowing anything about the Self. Anyone among them, whether a god or a demon, who will understand the teaching this way [thinking the body to be the Self] will be lost.’ Virocana, the king of the demons, went back to the demons happy in mind and explained to them the upaniṣad:

॥ इति अष्टमः खण्डः ॥

This is why in this world even today people say, ‘Oh, he is a demon,’ if that person is devoid of the feeling of charity, has no respect for others, and never cares to perform a sacrifice, because the demons have the idea that the body is the Self. When a person dies they decorate the body with all kinds of offerings, new clothes, and jewellery, for they think that by this, the person will conquer the other world.

But even before Indra returned to the gods, a doubt arose in his mind: ‘When the body is well decorated, the reflection is also well decorated. When the body is in fine clothes, the reflection is also in fine clothes. When the body is neat and clean, the reflection is also neat and clean. Again, suppose a person is blind. Then the reflection will show a blind body. Or if the body is lame, the reflection will show a lame body. Or if the body is hurt in some way, the reflection will show the same. Then again, if the body is destroyed, the reflection is gone. I don’t see that anything good will come from this’.

There may be some defects in his body, but his dream body is not affected by them’.

तद्यत्रैतत्सुप्तः समस्तः सम्प्रसन्नः स्वप्नं न विजानात्येष आत्मेति होवाचैतदमृतमभयमेतद्ब्रह्मेति स ह शान्तहृदयः प्रवव्राज स हाप्राप्यैव देवानेतद्भयं ददर्श नाह खल्वयमेवं सम्प्रत्यात्मानं जानात्ययमहमस्मीति नो एवेमानि भूतानि विनाशमेवापीतो भवति नाहमत्र भोग्यं पश्यामीति ॥ ८.११.१ ॥

Prajāpati said: ‘When the self is sleeping, with all its organs inactive, it is free from worry and has no dreams. This is what the Self is like [i.e., it is spotless]. It is immortal and fearless. It is Brahman.’ Indra left happy in mind. But even before he got back to the gods, he was troubled by a doubt: ‘When the self is in deep sleep, it is not able to recognize itself as “I am so-and-so,” as it does when it is awake. Not only that, it does not even recognize beings around it. It is as if the self has been obliterated. I don’t see that anything good will come from this’.

॥ इति एकादशः खण्डः ॥

Prajāpati said: ‘Indra, it is so. I will explain the matter to you again. Stay here another five years.’ Indra lived there another five years. The total time Indra spent thus was one hundred and one years. This is what sages refer to when they say, ‘Indra lived with Prajāpati for one hundred and one years practising brahmacarya.’ Then Prajāpati said to him—

मघवन्मर्त्यं वा इदं शरीरमात्तं मृत्युना तदस्यामृतस्याशरीरस्यात्मनोऽधिष्ठानमात्तो वै सशरीरः प्रियाप्रियाभ्यां न वै सशरीरस्य सतः प्रियाप्रिययोरपहतिरस्त्यशरीरं वाव सन्तं न प्रियाप्रिये स्पृशतः ॥ ८.१२.१ ॥

Indra, this body is mortal. It has been captured by death. Yet it is the base of the Self, which is immortal and formless. One who has a body is subject to both happiness and unhappiness. In fact, there is no end to happiness and unhappiness so long as one has a body. But when a person is free from the body, nothing good or bad can touch him.

The air is formless. So also are clouds, lightning, and thunder. All these arise from the sky and assume their respective forms due to the heat of the sun.

In the same way, the joyful self arises from the body and, attaining the light of the Cosmic Self, appears in his own form. This is the Paramātman, the Cosmic Self. He then freely moves about eating, playing, or enjoying himself with women, carriages, or relatives, not remembering at all the body in which he was born. Just as horses or bullocks are harnessed to carriages, similarly prāṇa [life] remains harnessed to the body [due to karma].

तं वा एतं देवा आत्मानमुपासते तस्मात्तेषां सर्वे च लोका आत्ताः सर्वे च कामाः स सर्वांश्च लोकानाप्नोति सर्वांश्च कामान्यस्तमात्मानमनुविद्य विजानातीति ह प्र्जापतिरुवाच प्रजापतिरुवाच ॥ ८.१२.६ ॥
॥ इति द्वादशः खण्डः ॥

This Self is worshipped by the gods. This is why all worlds and all desirable things are within their grasp. One who fully understands and realizes this Self [with the help of teachers and the scriptures] is able to attain whatever worlds and whatever desirable things he wants. This is what Prajāpati taught Indra.

From the dark may I attain the diverse. From the diverse may I attain the dark. Like a horse shaking its fur [to remove the dirt], I will shake off whatever spot I may have on my character. Like the moon freeing itself from the mouth of Rāhu [and regaining its brightness], I will, having accomplished everything, lay down this body and attain that eternal Brahmaloka.

Brahmā taught this knowledge of the Self to Prajāpati, and Prajāpati taught it to Manu. Manu, in his turn, taught it to all human beings. A young man goes to live at his teacher’s house and serves him, and when he is free he studies the Vedas in the prescribed manner. After finishing all his studies, he goes back home and marries. But he continues to study the scriptures in a sacred place. He also teaches his children and disciples in such a way that they will be religious. He keeps all his senses under control and avoids violence unless he is at a holy place. This is how he lives his whole life. Then after death he goes to Brahmaloka, and he is not born again, he is not born again.
