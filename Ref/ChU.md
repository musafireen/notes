ओमित्येतदक्षरमुद्गीथमुपासीत । ओमिति ह्युद्गायति तस्योपव्याख्यानम् ॥ १.१.१ ॥

Om is the closest word to Brahman. Recite this Om as if you are worshipping Brahman. [That is, treat this Om as the symbol of Brahman and concentrate on the idea of their oneness.] How you recite this Om is being explained.

देवासुरा ह वै यत्र संयेतिरे उभये प्राजापत्यास्तद्ध 

The gods and goddesses and the demons are both children of Prajāpati, yet they fought among themselves. 

देवा उद्गीथमाजह्रुरनेनैनानभिभविष्याम इति ॥ १.२.१ ॥

The gods and goddesses then adopted the path of the udgītha, thinking they would thereby be able to overcome the demons.
#### 2
ते ह नासिक्यं प्राणमुद्गीथमुपासांचक्रिरे 

The gods and goddesses worshipped the prāṇa presiding over the nostrils as udgītha. 

तं हासुराः पाप्मना विविधुस्तस्मात्तेनोभयं जिघ्रति सुरभि च दुर्गन्धि च पाप्मना ह्येष विद्धः ॥ १.२.२ ॥

The demons, however, misused it. [To them it was only an organ of smelling.] That is why [because of this misuse] people smell both good and bad odours through the nostrils.
#### 7
अथ ह य एवायं मुख्यः प्राणस्तमुद्गीथमुपासांचक्रिरे 

Next, the gods and goddesses worshipped the chief prāṇa as udgītha. 

तंहासुरा ऋत्वा विदध्वंसुर्यथाश्मानमाखणमृत्वा विध्वंसेतैवम् ॥ १.२.७ ॥

As regards the demons, they all met their end in prāṇa, just as [chunks of earth] break into pieces when they hit an unbreakable stone.
#### 8
यथाश्मानमाखणमृत्वा विध्वंसत एवं हैव 

Just as when chunks of earth are thrown against an unbreakable stone they are themselves reduced to dust, 

स विध्वंसते य एवंविदि पापं कामयते 

similarly, if anyone wishes ill or causes an injury to a person who knows prāṇa, he invites his own destruction thereby. 

यश्चैनमभिदासति स एषोऽश्माखणः ॥ १.२.८ ॥

The person who knows prāṇa is immune to injury like a piece of unbreakable stone.
#### 9
नैवैतेन सुरभि न दुर्गन्धि विजानात्यपहतपाप्मा ह्येष 

So far as the chief prāṇa is concerned, there is no good or bad odour for it. This is because it is pure [i.e., it is never touched by anything evil born of egotism]. 

तेन यदश्नाति यत्पिबति तेनेतरान्प्राणानवति 

If this prāṇa eats and drinks anything, it does so only to sustain the sense organs [such as the eyes, the ears, and so on]. 

एतमु एवान्ततोऽवित्त्वोत्क्रमति व्याददात्येवान्तत इति ॥

When death occurs, the chief prāṇa does not eat or drink anything [and as a result, the sense organs collapse]. They seem to have left the body. [They still want to eat and drink, however, so that they may live, and] this is indicated by the fact that a person dies with the mouth open.
#### 10
तं हाङ्गिरा उद्गीथमुपासांचक्र 

The sage Aṅgirā worshipped the chief prāṇa as udgītha [i.e., Brahman, to whom the udgītha is addressed]. 

एतमु एवाङ्गिरसं मन्यन्तेऽङ्गानां यद्रसः ॥ १.२.१० ॥

The chief prāṇa is referred to as āṅgirasa, for it is the rasa [i.e., the essence, or support] of all the aṅgas [organs].
#### 11
तेन तं ह बृहस्पतिरुद्गीथमुपासांचक्र 

This is why Bṛhaspati worshipped prāṇa as udgītha. 

एतमु एव बृहस्पतिं मन्यन्ते वाग्घि बृहती तस्या एष पतिः ॥

Prāṇa is regarded as Bṛhaspati, for vāk [speech] is great [bṛhatī] and prāṇa is its lord [pati].
#### 13
तेन तंह बको दाल्भ्यो विदांचकार । 

The sage Baka, son of Dalbha, came to know prāṇa as it was. 

स ह नैमिशीयानामुद्गाता बभूव स ह स्मैभ्यः कामानागायति ॥ १.२.१३ ॥

That is why the sages of Naimiṣa forest selected him as the singer of their udgītha. He, in his turn, fulfilled their wishes.
#### 14
आगाता ह वै कामानां भवति य एतदेवं विद्वानक्षरमुद्गीथमुपास्त 

If a person knows the real meaning of prāṇa and worships it as udgītha akṣara [i.e., as Akṣara Brahman] he himself becomes Akṣara Brahman. 

He then worships everyone he wants to worship [i.e., in singing for prāṇa he sings for all], and he attains all he desires. 

इत्यध्यात्मम् ॥ १.२.१४ ॥

This is the attainment on the level of the body [adhyātma]. [The inner attainment is that he becomes one with prāṇa—that is, Akṣara Brahman.]

The sage Ghora, of the family of Aṅgirasa, taught this truth to Kṛṣṇa, the son of Devakī. As a result, Kṛṣṇa became free from all desires. Then Ghora said: ‘At the time of death a person should repeat these three mantras: “You never decay, you never change, and you are the essence of life.”’ Here are two Ṛk mantras in this connection:

सत्यकामो ह जाबालो जबालां मातरमामन्त्रयांचक्रे ब्रह्मचर्यं भवति विवत्स्यामि किंगोत्रो न्वहमस्मीति ॥ ४.४.१ ॥

Gautama asked him, ‘O Somya, what is your lineage?’ Satyakāma said: ‘Sir, I do not know what my lineage is. When I asked my mother, she said to me: “I was very busy serving many people when I was young, and I had you. As this was the situation, I know nothing about your lineage. My name is Jabālā, and your name is Satyakāma.” So, sir, I am Satyakāma Jābāla’.

Gautama said to him: ‘No non-brāhmin could speak like this. [Therefore, you must be a brāhmin.] O Somya, go and get me some fuel [for the sacrificial fire]. I will initiate you [as a brāhmin by presenting you with the sacred thread], as you have not deviated from truth.’ After the initiation, he selected four hundred feeble and famished cows. Addressing Satyakāma, Gautama said, ‘O Somya, take these cows away [and look after them].’ As. Satyakāma was taking them away, he said, ‘I will not come back until there are a thousand of them.’ He lived away for many years until they had become a thousand.

and within that there is a small space. One must search within this space and earnestly desire to know what is there.
