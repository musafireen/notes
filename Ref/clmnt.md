Νόμος οὖν καὶ ὑπόληψις κενὴ τὰ μυστήρια 14 καὶ τοῦ δράκοντος ἀπάτη τίς ἐστιν θρῃσκευομένη, τὰς ἀμυήτους ὄντως μυήσεις καὶ τὰς ἀνοργιάστους τελετὰς εὐσεβείᾳ νόθῳ προστρεπομένων. 

The mysteries, then, are mere custom and pointless opinion, and it is a deceit of the serpent that men worship when, with spurious piety, they turn toward these sacred initiations that are really profanities and solemn rites that are without sanctity.

οἷαι δὲ καὶ αἱ κίσται αἱ μυστικαί: δεῖ γὰρ ἀπογυμνῶσαι τὰ ἅγια αὐτῶν καὶ τὰ ἄρρητα ἐξειπεῖν. οὐ σησαμαῖ ταῦτα καὶ πυραμίδες καὶ τολύπαι καὶ πόπανα πολυόμφαλα χόνδροι τε ἁλῶν καὶ δράκων, ὄργιον Διονύσου Βασσάρου; οὐχὶ δὲ ῥοιαὶ πρὸς τοῖσδε καὶ κράδαι 15 νάρθηκές τε καὶ κιττοί, πρὸς δὲ καὶ φθοῖς καὶ μήκωνες; ταῦτ̓ ἔστιν αὐτῶν τὰ ἅγια. καὶ προσέτι Γῆς 16 Θέμιδος τὰ ἀπόρρητα σύμβολα ὀρίγανον, λύχνος, ξίφος, κτεὶς γυναικεῖος, ὅς ἐστιν, εὐφήμως καὶ μυστικῶς εἰπεῖν, μόριον γυναικεῖον. ὢ τῆς ἐμφανοῦς ἀναισχυντίας. 

Consider, too, the contents of the mystic chests, because I must strip bare their holy things and utter the unspeakable. Are they not sesame cakes, pyramid and spherical cakes, cakes with many navels, also balls of salt and a serpent, the mystic sign of Dionysos Bassareus? Are they not also pomegranates, fig branches, fennel stalks, ivy leaves, round cakes and poppies? These are their holy things? In addition, there are the unutterable symbols of Ge Themis, a lamp, a sword, and a woman’s comb, which is a euphemistic expression used for a woman’s secret parts. What manifest shamelessness!

πάλαι μὲν ἀνθρώποις σωφρονοῦσιν ἐπικάλυμμα ἡδονῆς νὺξ ἦν σιωπωμένη: νυνὶ δὲ τοῖς μυουμένοις πεῖρα 17 τῆς ἀκρασίας νύξ ἐστι λαλουμένη, καὶ τὸ πῦρ ἐλέγχει τὰ πάθη δᾳδουχούμενον. ἀπόσβεσον, ὦ ἱεροφάντα, τὸ πῦρ: [p. 46] αἰδέσθητι, δᾳδοῦχε, τὰς λαμπάδας: ἐλέγχει σου τὸν Ἴακχον τὸ φῶς: ἐπίτρεψον ἀποκρύψαι τῇ νυκτὶ τὰ μυστήρια: σκότει τετιμήσθω τὰ ὄργια. τὸ πῦρ οὐχ ὑποκρίνεται: ἐλέγχειν καὶ κολάζειν κελεύεται. 

Formerly night, which drew a veil over the pleasures of temperate men, was a time for silence. But now, when night is for those who are being initiated a temptation to sexual license, talk abounds, and the torch-fires convict unbridled passions. Quench the fire, you priest! Shrink from the flaming brands, torchbearer! The light convicts your Iacchos. Experience night to hide the mysteries. Let the rites (orgia) be honoured by darkness. The fire is not acting a part; to convict and to punish is fire’s [God’s fire’s] duty.
### s23
Ταῦτα τῶν ἀθέων τὰ μυστήρια: ἀθέους δὲ εἰκότως ἀποκαλῶ τούτους, οἳ τὸν μὲν ὄντως ὄντα θεὸν ἠγνοήκασιν, παιδίον δὲ ὑπὸ Τιτάνων διασπώμενον καὶ γύναιον πενθοῦν καὶ μόρια ἄρρητα ὡς ἀληθῶς ὑπ̓ αἰσχύνης ἀναισχύντως σέβουσιν, διττῇ ἐνεσχημένοι τῇ ἀθεότητι, 

These are the mysteries of the atheists. And I am right in branding as atheists men who are ignorant of the true God, but shamelessly worship a child [i.e. Dionysos as a child] being torn to pieces by Titans, a poor grief-stricken woman, and parts of the body which, from a sense of shame, are truly too sacred to speak of. It is a twofold atheism in which they are entangled. 

προτέρᾳ μέν, καθ̓ ἣν ἀγνοοῦσι τὸν θεόν, τὸν ὄντως ὄντα μὴ γνωρίζοντες θεόν, ἑτέρᾳ δὲ καὶ δευτέρᾳ δὴ ταύτῃ τῇ πλάνῃ τοὺς οὐκ ὄντας ὡς ὄντας νομίζοντες καὶ θεοὺς τούτους ὀνομάζοντες τοὺς οὐκ ὄντως ὄντας, μᾶλλον δὲ οὐδὲ ὄντας, μόνου δὲ τοῦ ὀνόματος τετυχηκότας. διὰ τοῦτό τοι καὶ ὁ ἀπόστολος διελέγχει ἡμᾶς ‘καὶ ἦτε ξένοι’ λέγων ‘τῶν διαθηκῶν τῆς ἐπαγγελίας, ἐλπίδα μὴ ἔχοντες καὶ ἄθεοι ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ.’ 

(20) First, there is the atheism of being ignorant of God, since they do not recognize the true God.  Then there is the second error of believing in the existence of beings that have no existence, and calling by the name of gods those who are not really gods – no, in fact, who do not even exist, but only have the name. No doubt this is also the reason why the apostle convicts us, when he says, “And you were strangers from the covenants of the promise, being without hope and atheists in the world” [Pseudo-Paul, Letter to the Ephesians 2:12].

Πολλὰ κἀγαθὰ γένοιτο τῷ τῶν Σκυθῶν βασιλεῖ, ὅστις ποτὲ ἦν Ἀνάχαρσις. 18 οὗτος τὸν πολίτην τὸν ἑαυτοῦ, τὴν παρὰ Κυζικηνοῖς μητρὸς τῶν θεῶν τελετὴν ἀπομιμούμενον παρὰ Σκύθαις τύμπανόν τε [p. 48] ἐπικτυποῦντα καὶ κύμβαλον ἐπηχοῦντα καὶ τοῦ τραχήλου τινὰ μηναγύρτην ἐξηρτημένον, κατετόξευσεν, ὡς ἄνανδρον αὐτόν τε παῤ Ἕλλησι γεγενημένον καὶ τῆς θηλείας τοῖς ἄλλοις Σκυθῶν διδάσκαλον νόσου. 

[Example of Anacharsis the Scythian, drawn from Herodotos]

May the Scythian king, whoever he was, have all good things. When a countryman of his own [i.e. Anacharsis] was imitating among the Scythians the rite of the Mother of the Gods as practiced at Kyzikos (or: Cyzicus), by beating a drum and clanging a cymbal, and by having images of the goddess suspended from his neck like a begger for the Mother goddess (mēnagyrtēs), this king killed him with an arrow [Herodotus, Inquiries 4.76 – link]. The king did so on the ground that the man, having been deprived of his own virility in Greece, was now communicating the effeminate disease to his fellow Scythians.

ὧν δὴ χάριν ῾οὐ γὰρ οὐδαμῶς ἀποκρυπτέον̓ θαυμάζειν ἔπεισί μοι ὅτῳ τρόπῳ Εὐήμερον τὸν Ἀκραγαντῖνον καὶ Νικάνορα τὸν Κύπριον καὶ Διαγόραν καὶ Ἵππωνα τὼ Μηλίω 19 τόν τε Κυρηναῖον ἐπὶ τούτοις ἐκεῖνον ῾ὁ 20 Θεόδωρος ὄνομα αὐτᾦ καί τινας ἄλλους συχνούς, σωφρόνως βεβιωκότας καὶ καθεωρακότας ὀξύτερόν που τῶν λοιπῶν ἀνθρώπων τὴν ἀμφὶ τοὺς θεοὺς τούτους πλάνην, ἀθέους ἐπικεκλήκασιν, εἰ καὶ τὴν ἀλήθειαν αὐτὴν μὴ νενοηκότας, ἀλλὰ τὴν πλάνην γε ὑπωπτευκότας, ὅπερ οὐ σμικρὸν εἰς ἀλήθειαν 21 φρονήσεως ζώπυρον ἀναφύεται σπέρμα: ὧν ὁ μέν τις παρεγγυᾷ τοῖς Αἰγυπτίοις, ‘εἰ θεοὺς νομίζετε, μὴ θρηνεῖτε αὐτοὺς μηδὲ κόπτεσθε: εἰ δὲ πενθεῖτε αὐτούς, μηκέτι τούτους ἡγεῖσθε εἶναι θεούς,’ ὁ δ̓ Ἡρακλέα ἐκ ξύλου λαβὼν κατεσκευασμένον ῾ἔτυχε δὲ ἕψων τι οἴκοι, οἷα εἰκός᾿ ‘εἶα δή, ὦ Ἡράκλεις,’ εἶπεν: ‘νῦν σοι ἤδη καιρός, ὥσπερ Εὐρυσθεῖ, ἀτὰρ δὴ καὶ ἡμῖν ὑπουργῆσαι τὸν τρισκαιδέκατον τοῦτον ἆθλον καὶ Διαγόρᾳ τοὔψον 22 παρασκευάσαι.’ κἆτ̓ αὐτὸν εἰς τὸ πῦρ ἐνέθηκεν ὡς ξύλον. 

(21) I must not at all conceal what I think: All this makes me amazed how the label “atheist” has been applied to Euhemeros of Akragas, Nikanor of Cyprus, Diagoras and Hippo of Melos, with that Cyrenian named Theodoros and a good many others besides, men who lived sensible lives and discerned more acutely, I imagine, than the rest of humankind the error connected with these gods. Even if they did not perceive the truth itself, they at least suspected the error. This suspicion of error is a living spark of wisdom, and no small one, which grows up like a seed into truth. One of them [Xenophanes] directs the Egyptians in this way: “If you believe they are gods, do not lament them, nor beat the breast; but if you mourn for them, no longer consider these beings to be gods.” Another, having taken hold of a Herakles made from a log of wood – he happened, likely enough, to be cooking something at home – said: “Come, Herakles, now is your time to undertake this thirteenth labour for me, as you did the twelve for Eurystheus, and prepare Diagoras his dish!” Then he put him into the fire like a log.

[p. 50] Ἀκρότητες ἄρα ἀμαθίας ἀθεότης καὶ δεισιδαιμονία, ὦν ἐκτὸς μένειν σπουδαστέον. 

It appears then that atheism and fear of the lower spirits (deisidaimonia) are the extreme points of stupidity, from which we must earnestly endeavour to keep ourselves apart. . . . [omitted remainder of section which shifts to the causes of the Greek worship of images or idolatry].

[p. 84] τί καὶ χρὴ λέγειν ἔτι, ἀποχρώντως αὐτῶν διεληλεγμένων; 

How much better are Egyptians, when in cities and villages they hold in great honour irrational animals, than Greeks who worship gods such as these? For though the Egyptian gods are beasts, still they are not adulterous, they are not lewd, and not one of them seeks for pleasure contrary to its own nature. But as for the characteristics of the Greek gods, what need is there to say more? They have been sufficiently exposed [i.e. in the previous section about Greek myths about deities].

Ἀλλ̓ οὖν γε Αἰγύπτιοι, ὧν νῦν δὴ ἐμνήσθην, κατὰ τὰς θρῃσκείας τὰς σφῶν ἐσκέδανται: σέβουσι δὲ αὐτῶν Συηνῖται 63 φάγρον τὸν ἰχθύν, μαιώτην δὲ ῾ἄλλος 64 οὗτος ἰχθύς᾿ οἱ τὴν Ἐλεφαντίνην οἰκοῦντες, Ὀξυρυγχῖται τὸν φερώνυμον τῆς χώρας αὐτῶν ὁμοίως ἰχθύν, ἔτι γε μὴν Ἡρακλεοπολῖται ἰχνεύμονα, Σαῗται δὲ καὶ Θηβαῖοι πρόβατον, Λυκοπολῖται δὲ λύκον, Κυνοπολασῖται δὲ κύνα, τὸν Ἆπιν Μεμφῖται, Μενδήσιοι τὸν τράγον. 

(34) However, the Egyptians that I mentioned just now are divided on the issue of worship (thrēskeia). The people of Syene revere the fish phagros. The inhabitants of Elephantine revere another fish, the maiotes. The people of Oxyrhynchos also revere a fish, that which bears the name of their land. Further, the people of Herakleopolis revere the ichneumon; those of of Sais and Thebes, the sheep; those of Lykopolis, the wolf; those of Kynopolis, the dog; those of Memphis, the bull Apis; and, those of Mendes, the goat.

ὑμεῖς δὲ οι（ πάντ̓ ἀμείνους Αἰγυπτίων ῾ὀκνῶ δὲ εἰπεῖν χείρους᾿, οἳ τοὺς Αἰγυπτίους ὁσημέραι γελῶντες οὐ παύεσθε, 65 ποῖοί 66 τινες καὶ περὶ τὰ ἄλογα ζῷα; Θεσσαλοὶ μὲν ὑμῶν τοὺς πελαργοὺς τετιμήκασι διὰ τὴν συνήθειαν, Θηβαῖοι δὲ τὰς γαλᾶς διὰ τὴν Ἡρακλέους γένεσιν. 

[Greeks engaging in animal worship, with citation of works on Greek customs]
But as for you [Greeks], who are in every way better than Egyptians – I pull back from calling you worse – you never let a day pass without laughing at the Egyptians, but what is your attitude with regard to the irrational animals? The Thessalians among you honour storks based on an old custom, and Thebans honour weasels on account of the birth of Herakles.

τί δὲ πάλιν Θετταλοί; μύρμηκας ἱστοροῦνται σέβειν, ἐπεὶ τὸν Δία μεμαθήκασιν ὁμοιωθέντα μύρμηκι τῇ Κλήτορος θυγατρὶ Εὐρυμεδούσῃ μιγῆναι καὶ Μυρμιδόνα γεννῆσαι: Πολέμων δὲ τοὺς ἀμφὶ τὴν Τρωάδα κατοικοῦντας ἱστορεῖ τοὺς ἐπιχωρίους μῦς σέβειν, 67 οὓς σμίνθους καλοῦσιν, ὅτι τὰς νευρὰς [p. 86] τῶν πολεμίων διέτρωγον τῶν τόξων: καὶ Σμίνθιον Ἀπόλλωνα ἀπὸ τῶν μυῶν ἐκείνων ἐπεφήμισαν. 

What else about Thessalians? They are reported to worship ants, because they have been taught that Zeus, in the likeness of an ant, had intercourse with Eurymedusa the daughter of Kletor and gave birth to Myrmidon. Polemon relates that the inhabitants of the Troad worship the local mice (which they call sminthoi), because these used to gnaw through their enemies’ bowstrings, and they named Apollo “Smintheus” after these mice.

Ἡρακλείδης δὲ ἐν Κτίσεσιν ἱερῶν περὶ τὴν Ἀκαρνανίαν φησίν, ἔνθα τὸ Ἄκτιόν ἐστιν ἀκρωτήριον καὶ τοῦ Ἀπόλλωνος τοῦ Ἀκτίου τὸ ἱερόν, ταῖς μυίαις προθύεσθαι βοῦν. οὐδὲ μὴν Σαμίων ἐκλήσομαι ῾πρόβατον, ὥς φησιν Εὐφορίων, σέβουσι Σάμιοἰ οὐδέ γε τῶν τὴν Φοινίκην Σύρων κατοικούντων, ὧν οἱ μὲν τὰς περιστεράς, οἱ δὲ τοὺς ἰχθῦς οὕτω σέβουσι περιττῶς ὡς Ἠλεῖοι τὸν Δία. 

Herakleides, in his work on The Founding of Temples in Akarnania, says that on the promontory of Actium, where the temple of Apollo of Actium is located, a preliminary sacrifice of an ox is made to the flies. Nor will I forget the Samians, who, as Euphorion says, revere the sheep. (35) No, nor will I forget the Syrian inhabitants of Phoenicia, some of whom revere doves and others revere fish [cf. Lucian at this link], as extravagantly as the Eleans worship Zeus.

Εἶεν δή: ἐπειδὴ οὐ θεοί, οὓς θρῃσκεύετε, αὖθις ἐπισκέψασθαί μοι δοκεῖ εἰ ὄντως εἶεν δαίμονες, δευτέρᾳ ταύτῃ, ὡς ὑμεῖς φατέ, ἐγκαταλεγόμενοι τάξει. 

So then, since the ones you whom you worship are not gods, I am resolved to make a fresh examination to see whether it is true that they are lower spirits (daimones) and should be enrolled, as you say, in this second rank 

εἰ γὰρ οὖν δαίμονες, λίχνοι τε καὶ μιαροί. ἔστι μὲν ἐφευρεῖν καὶ ἀναφανδὸν οὕτω κατὰ πόλεις δαίμονας ἐπιχωρίους τιμὴν ἐπιδρεπομένους, παρὰ Κυθνίοις Μενέδημον, παρὰ Τηνίοις Καλλισταγόραν, παρὰ Δηλίοις Ἄνιον, παρὰ Λάκωσιν Ἀστράβακον. τιμᾶται δέ τις καὶ Φαληροῖ κατὰ πρύμναν ἥρως: καὶ ἡ Πυθία συνέταξε θύειν Πλαταιεῦσιν Ἀνδροκράτει καὶ Δημοκράτει καὶ Κυκλαίῳ καὶ Λεύκωνι τῶν Μηδικῶν ἀκμαζόντων ἀγώνων.

[i.e. compared to higher gods]. . . [omitted extensive discussion of whether the so-called gods are really lower spirits].

τίνα δ̓ ἂν φωνὴν ἄλλην, εἰ φωνὴν λάβοιεν Αἰγυπτίων θεοί, οἷα αἴλουροι καὶ γαλαῖ, προήσονται ἢ τὴν Ὁμηρικήν τε καὶ ποιητικήν, τῆς κνίσης τε καὶ ὀψαρτυτικῆς φίλην; τοιοίδε μέντοι παῤ ὑμῖν οἵ τε δαίμονες καὶ οἱ θεοὶ καὶ εἴ τινες [p. 90] ἡμίθεοι ὥσπερ ἡμίονοι κέκληνται: οὐδὲ γὰρ οὐδὲ ὀνομάτων ὑμῖν πενία πρὸς τὰς τῆς ἀσεβείας συνθέσεις.

. . . (36) If Egyptian gods, such as cats and weasels, were to be endowed with speech, what other cry are they likely to give forth than this from Homer’s poems, proclaiming a love for savoury odours and cookery? Be that as it may, such is the character of the lower spirits (daimones) and gods you worship, and of the semi-gods (hēmitheoi) too, if you have any called by this name, on the analogy of mules, or semi-asses. For you have no poverty – not even of words to form into the compounds needed for your impiety.

Φέρε δὴ οὖν καὶ τοῦτο προσθῶμεν, ὡς ἀπάνθρωποι καὶ μισάνθρωποι δαίμονες εἶεν ὑμῶν οἱ θεοὶ καὶ οὐχὶ μόνον ἐπιχαίροντες τῇ φρενοβλαβείᾳ τῶν ἀνθρώπων, πρὸς δὲ καὶ ἀνθρωποκτονίας ἀπολαύοντες: νυνὶ μὲν τὰς ἐν σταδίοις ἐνόπλους φιλονεικίας, νυνὶ δὲ τὰς ἐν πολέμοις ἀναρίθμους φιλοτιμίας ἀφορμὰς σφίσιν ἡδονῆς ποριζόμενοι, ὅπως ὅτι μάλιστα ἔχοιεν ἀνθρωπείων ἀνέδην ἐμφορεῖσθαι φόνων: ἤδη δὲ κατὰ πόλεις καὶ ἔθνη, οἱονεὶ λοιμοὶ ἐπισκήψαντες, σπονδὰς ἀπῄτησαν ἀνημέρους. 

Come then, let us add this: that your gods are inhuman and man-hating lower spirits (daimones) who not only celebrate at the insanity of men, but go so far as to enjoy human slaughter. They provide for themselves sources of pleasure, at one time in the armed contests of the stadium, at another in the innumerable rivalries of war, in order to secure every possible opportunity of glutting themselves to the full with human blood. Before now, too, they have fallen like plagues on whole cities and peoples (ethnē), and have demanded drink-offerings of a savage character.

Ἀριστομένης γοῦν ὁ Μεσσήνιος τῷ Ἰθωμήτῃ Διὶ τριακοσίους ἀπέσφαξεν, τοσαύτας ὁμοῦ καὶ τοιαύτας καλλιερεῖν οἰόμενος ἑκατόμβας: ἐν οἷς καὶ Θεόπομπος ἦν ὁ 1 Λακεδαιμονίων βασιλεύς, ἱερεῖον εὐγενές. 

For instance, Aristomenes the Messenian slaughtered three hundred men to Zeus of Ithome, in the belief that favourable omens are secured by sacrifices of such magnitude and quality. Among the victims was even Theopompos, the Lakedaimonian king, a noble offering.

Ταῦροι δὲ τὸ ἔθνος, οἱ περὶ τὴν Ταυρικὴν χερρόνησον κατοικοῦντες, οὓς ἂν τῶν [p. 92] ξένων παῤ αὐτοῖς ἕλωσι, τούτων δὴ τῶν κατὰ θάλατταν ἐπταικότων, αὐτίκα μάλα τῇ Ταυρικῇ καταθύουσιν Ἀρτέμιδι: 

The Taurian people, who inhabit the Taurian peninsula [north shore of the Black Sea, near Chersonesos], whenever they capture strangers in their territory, that is to say, men who have been shipwrecked, they sacrifice them on the spot to Taurian Artemis. 

ταύτας σου τὰς θυσίας Εὐριπίδης ἐπὶ σκηνῆς τραγῳδεῖ. 

These are your sacrifices which Euripides represents in tragedy upon the stage [Iphigeneia among the Taurians].
#### 4
Μόνιμος δ̓ ἱστορεῖ ἐν τῇ τῶν θαυμασίων συναγωγῇ ἐν Πέλλῃ τῆς Θετταλίας Ἀχαιὸν ἄνθρωπον Πηλεῖ καὶ Χείρωνι καταθύεσθαι: 

Monimos, in his Collection of Amazing Things, relates that in Pella of Thessaly human sacrifice is offered to Peleus and Cheiron, the victim being an Achaian. Thus too, Antikleides in his Homecomings, declares that

Λυκτίους 2 γὰρ ῾Κρητῶν δὲ ἔθνος εἰσὶν οὗτοι 3᾿ Ἀντικλείδης ἐν Νόστοις ἀποφαίνεται ἀνθρώπους ἀποσφάττειν τῷ Διί, καὶ Λεσβίους Διονύσῳ τὴν ὁμοίαν προσάγειν θυσίαν Δωσίδας λέγει: 

the Lyktians, a Cretan people (ethnos), slaughter men to Zeus. Dosidas says that inhabitants of Lesbos offer a similar sacrifice to Dionysos.

Φωκαεῖς δέ ῾οὐδὲ γὰρ αὐτοὺς παραπέμψομαἰ—τούτους Πυθοκλῆς ἐν τρίτῳ Περὶ ὁμονοίας τῇ Ταυροπόλῳ Ἀρτέμιδι ἄνθρωπον ὁλοκαυτεῖν 4 ἱστορεῖ. 

As for Phokaians – for I won’t pass over them either – these people are reported by Pythokles in his third book On Concord to offer a burnt sacrifice of a man to Taurian Artemis. 

#### 7
Ἐρεχθεὺς δὲ ὁ ᾿Λττικὸς καὶ Μάριος ὁ Ῥωμαῖος τὰς αὑτῶν ἐθυσάτην θυγατέρας: ὧν ὁ μὲν τῇ Φερεφάττῃ, ὡς Δημάρατος ἐν πρώτῃ Τραγῳδουμένων, ὁ δὲ τοῖς Ἀποτροπαίοις, ὁ Μάριος, ὡς Δωρόθεος ἐν τῇ τετάρτῃ Ἰταλικῶν ἱστορεῖ. 

(37) Erechtheus the Athenian and Marius the Roman sacrificed their own daughters, the former to Persephone, as Demaratos relates in the first book of his Subjects of Tragedy; the latter, Marius, to the “Averters of evil,” as Dorotheus relates in the fourth book of his investigation of Italian Matters.
#### 8
Φιλάνθρωποί γε ἐκ τούτων καταφαίνονται οἱ δαίμονες: πῶς δὲ οὐχ ὅσιοι ἀναλόγως οἱ δεισιδαίμονες; οἱ μὲν σωτῆρες εὐφημούμενοι, οἱ δὲ σωτηρίαν αἰτούμενοι παρὰ τῶν ἐπιβούλων σωτηρίας. καλλιερεῖν γοῦν τοπάζοντες αὐτοῖς σφᾶς [p. 94] αὐτοὺς λελήθασιν ἀποσφάττοντες ἀνθρώπους. 

To be sure, the lower spirits (daimones) are kind beings, as these instances plainly show! And how can those who fear the lower spirits help being holy in a corresponding way? The former are hailed as saviours; the latter beg for safety from those who plot to destroy safety. Certainly while they suppose that they are offering acceptable sacrifices to the lower spirits, they forget that they are slaughtering human beings. 
#### 9
οὐ γὰρ οὖν παρὰ τὸν τόπον ἱερεῖον γίνεται ὁ φόνος, οὐδ̓ εἰ Ἀρτέμιδί τις καὶ Διὶ ἐν ἱερῷ δῆθεν χωρίῳ μᾶλλον ἢ ὀργῇ καὶ φιλαργυρίᾳ, ἄλλοις ὁμοίοις δαίμοσιν, ἐπὶ βωμοῖς ἢ ἐν ὁδοῖς ἀποσφάττοι τὸν ἄνθρωπον, ἱερὸν 5 ἱερεῖον ἐπιφημίσας, ἀλλὰ φόνος ἐστὶ καὶ ἀνδροκτασία ἡ τοιαύτη θυσία. 

For murder does not become a sacred offering because of the place in which it is committed, not even if you solemnly dedicate a man and then slaughter him in a so-called sacred spot for Artemis or Zeus, rather than for anger or covetousness, other lower spirits of the same sort, or upon altars rather than in roads. On the contrary, such sacrifice is murder and human butchery. . .

If you like, now let us survey the opinions which the philosophers, on their part, assert confidently about the gods. Perhaps we may find philosophy herself, through vanity, forming her conceptions of the godhead out of matter, or else we may be able to show in passing that, when deifying certain divine powers, she sees the truth in a dream. Some philosophers, then, left us the elements as first principles of all things. Water was selected for praise by Thales of Miletos; air by Anaximenes of the same city, who was followed afterwards by Diogenes of Apollonia. Fire and earth were introduced as gods by Parmenides of Elea. Yet only one of this pair, namely fire, is god according to the supposition of both Hippasos of Metaponton and Herakleitos of Ephesos. As to Empedokles of Akragas, he chooses plurality, and reckons “love” and “strife” in his list of gods, in addition to these four elements.

Ἄθεοι μὲν δὴ καὶ οὗτοι, σοφίᾳ τινὶ ἀσόφῳ τὴν ὕλην προσκυνήσαντες καὶ λίθους μὲν ἢ ξύλα οὐ τιμήσαντες, γῆν δὲ τὴν τούτων μητέρα ἐκθειάσαντες καὶ Ποσειδῶνα μὲν οὐκ ἀναπλάττοντες, ὕδωρ δὲ αὐτὸ προστρεπόμενοι. τί γάρ ἐστί ποτε ὁ 4 Ποσειδῶν ἢ ὑγρά τις οὐσία ἐκ τῆς πόσεως ὀνοματοποιουμένη; 

ὥσπερ ἀμέλει ὁ πολέμιος Ἄρης ἀπὸ τῆς ἄρσεως [p. 146] καὶ ἀναιρέσεως κεκλημένος, ᾗ καὶ δοκοῦσί μοι πολλοὶ μάλιστα τὸ ξίφος μόνον πήξαντες ἐπιθύειν ὡς Ἄρει: ἔστι δὲ Σκυθῶν τὸ τοιοῦτον, καθάπερ Εὔδοξος ἐν δευτέρᾳ Γῆς 5 περιόδου λέγει, Σκυθῶν δὲ οἱ Σαυρομάται, ὥς φησιν Ἱκέσιος ἐν τῷ περὶ μυστηρίων, ἀκινάκην σέβουσιν. 

(2) These men also were really atheists, since with a foolish show of wisdom they worshipped matter. They did not, it is true, honour stocks or stones, but they made a god out of earth, which is the mother of these. They do not fashion a Poseidon, but they adore water itself. For what in the world is Poseidon, except a kind of liquid substance named from posis, “drink”? Just as, without a doubt, warlike Ares is so named after arsis and anairesis, “abolition” and “destruction.”

[Scythians and Sauromatians and their war gods]

This is the chief reason, I think, why many peoples simply fix their sword in the ground and then offer sacrifice to it as if to Ares [god of war]. Such is the custom of the Scythians, as Eudoxos says in his second book of Geography, while the Sauromatians, a Scythian people, worship a dagger, according to Hikesios in his book on Mysteries.

τοῦτό τοι καὶ οἱ ἀμφὶ τὸν Ἡράκλειτον τὸ πῦρ ὡς ἀρχέγονον σέβοντες πεπόνθασιν: τὸ γὰρ πῦρ τοῦτο ἕτεροι Ἥφαιστον ὠνόμασαν. 

[Persian Magians, and contrast with Egyptians]

This too is the case with the followers of Herakleitos when they worship fire as the source of all, because this fire is what others named Hephaistos. 

### s65
Περσῶν δὲ οἱ μάγοι τὸ πῦρ τετιμήκασι καὶ τῶν τὴν Ἀσίαν κατοικούντων πολλοί, πρὸς δὲ καὶ Μακεδόνες, ὥς φησι Διογένης ἐν α Περσικῶν. τί μοι Σαυρομάτας καταλέγειν, οὓς Νυμφόδωρος ἐν Νομίμοις βαρβαρικοῖς τὸ πῦρ σέβειν ἱστορεῖ, ἢ τοὺς Πέρσας καὶ τοὺς Μήδους καὶ τοὺς μάγους; θύειν ἐν ὑπαίθρῳ τούτους ὁ Δίνων λέγει, θεῶν ἀγάλματα μόνα τὸ πῦρ καὶ ὕδωρ νομίζοντας. 

The Persian Magians (Magoi / Magi) and many of the inhabitants of Asia have assigned honour to fire. So have the Macedonians, as Diogenes says in the first volume of his Persian History. Why do I need to cite the Sauromatians, whom Nymphodoros [of Amphipolis, third century BCE] in Barbarian Customs [link] reports as worshipping fire, or to cite the Persians, Medes and Magians? Dinon [of Kolophon, fourth century BCE] says that these Magians sacrifice under the open sky, believing that fire and water are the sole elements of divinity.

οὐκ ἀπεκρυψάμην οὐδὲ τὴν τούτων ἄγνοιαν. εἰ γὰρ καὶ τὰ μάλιστα ἀποφεύγειν οἴονται τῆς πλάνης, ἀλλ̓ εἰς ἑτέραν κατολισθαίνουσιν ἀπάτην: ἀγάλματα μὲν θεῶν οὐ ξύλα καὶ λίθους ὑπειλήφασιν ὥσπερ Ἕλληνες οὐδὲ μὴν ἴβιδας καὶ ἰχνεύμονας καθάπερ Αἰγύπτιοι, ἀλλὰ πῦρ τε καὶ ὕδωρ ὡς φιλόσοφοι. μετὰ πολλὰς μέντοι ὕστερον περιόδους ἐτῶν ἀνθρωποειδῆ ἀγάλματα σέβειν αὐτοὺς Βήρωσσος [p. 148] ἐν τρίτῃ Χαλδαϊκῶν παρίστησι, τοῦτο Ἀρταξέρξου τοῦ Δαρείου τοῦ Ὤχου εἰσηγησαμένου, ὃς πρῶτος τῆς Ἀφροδίτης Ἀναΐτιδος 6 τὸ ἄγαλμα ἀναστήσας ἐν Βαβυλῶνι καὶ Σούσοις καὶ Ἐκβατάνοις Πέρσαις καὶ Βάκτροις καὶ Δαμασκῷ καὶ Σάρδεσιν ὑπέδειξε σέβειν. 

Even their ignorance I do not conceal. For although they are quite convinced that they are escaping the error of revering idols, they still slip into another delusion. They do not suppose, like Greeks, that stocks and stones are emblems of divinity, nor ibises and ichneumons, after the custom of Egyptians. But they do admit fire and water, as philosophers do. It was not, however, till many ages had passed that they began to worship statues in human form, as Berossos shows in his third book of Chaldean Matters. For this custom was introduced by Artaxerxes [reigning ca. 465–424 BCE] the son of Darius and father of Ochios, who was the first to set up the statue of Aphrodite Anaitis in Babylon, Susa and Ekbatana, and to enjoin this worship upon Persians and Baktrians, upon Damaskos and Sardis.

ὁμολογούντων τοίνυν οἱ φιλόσοφοι τοὺς διδασκάλους τοὺς σφῶν Πέρσας ἢ Σαυρομάτας ἢ μάγους, παῤ ὧν τὴν ἀθεότητα τῶν σεβασμίων αὐτοῖς μεμαθήκασιν ἀρχῶν, ἄρχοντα τὸν πάντων ποιητὴν καὶ τῶν ἀρχῶν αὐτῶν δημιουργὸν ἀγνοοῦντες, τὸν ἄναρχον θεόν, τὰ δὲ ‘πτωχὰ’ ταῦτα καὶ ‘ἀσθενῆ,’ ᾗ φησιν ὁ ἀπόστολος, τὰ εἰς τὴν ἀνθρώπων ὑπηρεσίαν πεποιημένα ‘στοιχεῖα’ προστρεπόμενοι. 

[Philosophers’ views about four elements derivative of Scythians and Persians]

Therefore, let the philosophers confess that Persians, Sauromatians, and Magians are their teachers, from whom they have learned the atheistic doctrine of their venerated “first principles.” They do not know the great original, the maker of all things, and creator of the “first principles” themselves, God without beginning. Instead, the philosophers offer adoration to these “weak and beggarly elements,” as the apostle calls them, made for the service of men [Paul, Letter to the Galatians 4:9]. . . .

right, / Severe, without pretence, expedient ever, / Fearless and griefless, helpful, soothing pain, / Well-pleasing, advantageous, steadfast, loved, / Esteemed, consistent . . . Renowned, not puffed up, careful, gentle, strong, / Enduring, blameless, lives from age to age.” “Slavish the man who listens to vain opinion, / In hope to light on any good from that.” In these passages he teaches clearly, I think, what is the nature of God, and how common opinion and custom make slaves of those who follow them instead of searching after God.

οὐκ ἀποκρυπτέον οὐδὲ τοὺς ἀμφὶ τὸν Πυθαγόραν, οἵ φασιν ‘ὁ μὲν θεὸς εἷς, οὗτος 20 δὲ οὐχ, ὥς τινες ὑπονοοῦσιν, ἐκτὸς τᾶς διακοσμήσιος, ἀλλ̓ ἐν αὐτᾷ, ὅλος ἐν ὅλῳ τῷ κύκλῳ, ἐπίσκοπος πάσας γενέσιος, κρᾶσις τῶν ὅλων αἰώνων 21 καὶ ἐργάτας τῶν αὐτοῦ δυνάμιων καὶ ἔργων ἁπάντων ἐν οὐρανῷ φωστὴρ καὶ πάντων πατήρ, νοῦς καὶ ψύχωσις τῶ ὅλω κύκλω, 22 πάντων κίνασις.’ 

Nor must we conceal the doctrine of the Pythagoreans, who say that “God is One, and God is not, as some suspect, outside the universal order, but within it, being wholly present in the whole circle, the supervisor of all creation, the blending of all the ages, the wielder of his own powers, the light of all his works in heaven and the father of all things, mind and living principle of the whole circle, movement of all things.”

ἀπόχρη καὶ τάδε εἰς ἐπίγνωσιν θεοῦ ἐπιπνοίᾳ θεοῦ πρὸς αὐτῶν μὲν ἀναγεγραμμένα, πρὸς δὲ ἡμῶν ἐξειλεγμένα τῷ γε καὶ σμικρὸν διαθρεῖν ἀλήθειαν δυναμένῳ.

These sayings have been recorded by their authors through God’s inspiration, and we have selected them. As a guide to the full knowledge of God they are sufficient for every person who is able, even in small measure, to investigate the truth. . . .

Ἴτω δὲ ἡμῖν ῾οὐ γὰρ αὐταρκεῖ μόνον ἡ φιλοσοφίἀ ἀλλὰ καὶ αὐτὴ ἡ 1 ποιητικὴ ἡ περὶ τὸ ψεῦδος τὰ πάντα ἠσχολημένη, μόλις ποτὲ ἤδη ἀλήθειαν μαρτυρήσουσα, μᾶλλον δὲ ἐξομολογουμένη τῷ θεῷ τὴν μυθώδη παρέκβασιν: παρίτω δὴ ὅστις καὶ βούλεται [p. 164] ποιητὴς πρῶτος. 

Let poetry also approach to us (for philosophy alone will not suffice): poetry which is wholly occupied with falsehood— which scarcely will make confession of the truth, but will rather own to God its deviations into fable. Let whoever of those poets chooses advance first. 

Ἄρατος μὲν οὖν διὰ πάντων τὴν δύναμιν τοῦ θεοῦ διήκειν νοεῖ, ὄφῤ ἔμπεδα πάντα φύωνται, τῷ μιν ἀεὶ πρῶτόν τε καὶ ὕστατον ἱλάσκονται: χαῖρε, πάτερ, μέγα θαῦμα, μέγ̓ ἀνθρώποισιν ὄνειαρ. 

Aratus considers that the power of God pervades all things:—

That all may be secure,
Him ever they propitiate first and last,
Hail, Father I great marvel, great gain to man.

ταύτῃ τοι καὶ ὁ Ἀσκραῖος αἰνίττεται Ἡσίοδος τὸν θεόν: 

Thus also the Ascræan Hesiod dimly speaks of God: —

αὐτὸς γὰρ πάντων βασιλεὺς καὶ κοίρανός ἐστιν, ἀθανάτων τέο δ̓ 2 οὔτις ἐρήρισται κράτος ἄλλος. 

For He is the King of all, and monarch
Of the immortals; and there is none that may vie
with Him in power.
### s74
ἤδη δὲ καὶ ἐπὶ τῆς σκηνῆς παραγυμνοῦσι τὴν ἀλήθειαν: 

Also on the stage they reveal the truth:—

ὁ μὲν καὶ εἰς τὸν αἰθέρα καὶ εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν ἀναβλέψας ‘τόνδε ἡγοῦ θεόν,’ φησίν, Εὐριπίδης: ὁ δὲ τοῦ Σοφίλλου Σοφοκλῆς, εἷς ταῖς ἀληθείαισιν, εἷς ἐστὶν θεός, ὃς οὐρανόν τ̓ ἔτευξε καὶ γαῖαν μακρὴν πόντου τε χαροπὸν οἶδμα κἀνέμων βίας: θνητοὶ δὲ πολλὰ 3 καρδίᾳ πλανώμενοι ἱδρυσάμεσθα πημάτων παραψυχὴν θεῶν ἀγάλματ̓ ἐκ λίθων, ἢ χαλκέων ἢ χρυσοτεύκτων ἢ ἐλεφαντίνων τύπους: θυσίας τε τούτοις καὶ κενὰς πανηγύρεις νέμοντες, οὕτως εὐσεβεῖν νομίζομεν. 

says Euripides. And Sophocles, the son of Sophilus, says:—

Look on the ether and heaven, and regard that as God,

One, in truth, one is God,
Who made both heaven and the far-stretching earth,
And ocean's blue wave, and the mighty winds;
But many of us mortals, deceived in heart,
Have set up for ourselves, as a consolation in our afflictions,
Images of the gods of stone, or wood, or brass,
Or gold, or ivory;
And, appointing to those sacrifices and vain festal assemblages,
Are accustomed thus to practice religion.

οὑτοσὶ μὲν ἤδη καὶ παρακεκινδυνευμένως ἐπὶ τῆς σκηνῆς τὴν ἀλήθειαν τοῖς θεαταῖς παρεισήγαγεν. [p. 166] ὁ δὲ Θρᾴκιος ἱεροφάντης καὶ ποιητὴς ἅμα, ὁ τοῦ Οἰάγρου Ὀρφεύς, μετὰ τὴν τῶν ὀργίων ἱεροφαντίαν καὶ τῶν εἰδώλων τὴν θεολογίαν, παλινῳδίαν ἀληθείας εἰσάγει, τὸν ἱερὸν ὄντως ὀψέ ποτε, ὅμως δ̓ οὖν ᾄδων λόγον: 

In this venturous manner has he on the stage brought truth before the spectators. But the Thracian Orpheus, the son of Œagrus, hierophant and poet at once, after his exposition of the orgies, and his theology of idols, introduces a palinode of truth with true solemnity, though tardily singing the strain:—

φθέγξομαι οἷς θέμις ἐστί: θύρας δ̓ ἐπίθεσθε βέβηλοι πάντες ὁμῶς: σὺ δ̓ ἄκουε, φαεσφόρου ἔκγονε Μήνης, Μουσαἶ , ἐξερέω γὰρ ἀληθέα, μηδέ σε τὰ πρὶν ἐν στήθεσσι φανέντα φίλης αἰῶνος ἀμέρσῃ. εἰς δὲ λόγον θεῖον βλέψας τούτῳ προσέδρευε, ἰθύνων κραδίης νοερὸν κύτος: εὖ δ̓ ἐπίβαινε ἀτραπιτοῦ, μοῦνον δ̓ ἐσόρα κόσμοιο ἄνακτα ἀθάνατον. 

I shall utter to whom it is lawful; but let the doors be closed,
Nevertheless, against all the profane. But do you hear,
O Musæus, offspring of the light-bringing moon,
For I will declare what is true. And let not these things
Which once appeared in your breast rob you of dear life;
But looking to the divine word, apply yourself to it,
Keeping right the seat of intellect and feeling; and walk well
In the straight path, and to the immortal King of the universe alone
Direct your gaze.

εἶτα ὑποβὰς διαρρήδην ἐπιφέρει: εἶς ἔστ̓, αὐτογενής, ἑνὸς ἔκγονα πάντα τέτυκται: ἐν δ̓ αὐτοῖς αὐτὸς περινίσσεται, οὐδέ τις αὐτὸν εἰσοράᾳ θνητῶν, αὐτὸς δέ γε πάντας ὁρᾶται. 

Then proceeding, he clearly adds:—

He is one, self-proceeding; and from Him alone all things proceed,
And in them He Himself exerts his activity: no mortal
Beholds Him, but He beholds all.

οὕτως μὲν δὴ Ὀρφεύς: χρόνῳ γέ 4 ποτε συνῆκεν πεπλανημένος. ἀλλὰ σὺ μὴ μέλλων, βροτὲ ποικιλόμητι, βράδυνε, ἀλλὰ παλίμπλαγκτος στρέψας θεὸν ἱλάσκοιο. 

Thus far Orpheus at last understood that he had been in error:—

But linger no longer, O man, endued with varied wisdom;
But turn and retrace your steps, and propitiate God.

εἰ γὰρ καὶ τὰ μάλιστα ἐναύσματά τινα τοῦ λόγου τοῦ θείου λαβόντες Ἕλληνες ὀλίγα ἄττα τῆς ἀληθείας ἐφθέγξαντο, προσμαρτυροῦσι μὲν τὴν δύναμιν αὐτῆς οὐκ ἀποκεκρυμμένην, σφᾶς δὲ αὐτοὺς ἐλέγχουσιν ἀσθενεῖς, οὐκ ἐφικόμενοι τοῦ τέλους. 

For if, at the most, the Greeks, having received certain scintillations of the divine word, have given forth some utterances of truth, they bear indeed witness that the force of truth is not hidden, and at the same time expose their own weakness in not having arrived at the end. 
### s75
ἤδη γὰρ οἶμαι παντί τῳ δῆλον γεγονέναι ὡς τῶν [p. 168] χωρὶς τοῦ λόγου τῆς ἀληθείας ἐνεργούντων τι ἢ καὶ φθεγγομένων ὁμοίων ὄντων τοῖς χωρὶς βάσεως βαδίζειν βιαζομένοις. Δυσωπούντων δέ σε εἰς σωτηρίαν καὶ οἱ περὶ τοὺς θεοὺς ὑμῶν ἔλεγχοι, οὕς διὰ τὴν ἀλήθειαν ἐκβιαζόμενοι κωμῳδοῦσι ποιηταί. 

For I think it has now become evident to all, that those who do or speak anything without the word of truth are like people compelled to walk without feet. Let the strictures on your gods, which the poets, impelled by the force of truth, introduce in their comedies, shame you into salvation. 

Μένανδρος γοῦν ὁ κωμικὸς ἐν Ἡνιόχῳ ἐν Ὑποβολιμαίῳ 5 τῷ δράματι οὐδείς μ̓ ἀρέσκει ῾φησἲ περιπατῶν ἔξω θεὸς μετὰ γραός, οὐδ̓ εἰς οἰκίας παρεισιὼν ἐπὶ τοῦ σανιδίου: 

Menander, for instance, the comic poet, in his drama of the Charioteer, says:—

No God pleases me that goes about
With an old woman, and enters houses
Carrying a trencher.

μητραγύρτης 6 τοιοῦτοι γὰρ οἱ μητραγύρται. ὅθεν εἰκότως ὁ Ἀντισθένης ἔλεγεν αὐτοῖς μεταιτοῦσιν: ‘οὐ τρέφω τὴν μητέρα τῶν θεῶν, ἣν οἱ θεοὶ τρέφουσιν.’ 

For such are the begging priests of Cybele. Hence Antisthenes replies appropriately to their request for alms:—

I do not maintain the mother of the gods,
For the gods maintain her.

πάλιν δὲ ὁ αὐτὸς κωμῳδιοποιὸς ἐν Ἱερείᾳ τῷ δράματι χαλεπαίνων πρὸς τὴν συνήθειαν διελέγχειν πειρᾶται τὸν ἄθεον τῆς πλάνης τῦφον, ἐπιφθεγγόμενος ἐμφρόνως 

Again, the same writer of comedy, expressing his dissatisfaction with the common usages, tries to expose the impious arrogance of the prevailing error in the drama of the Priestess, sagely declaring:—

εἰ γὰρ ἕλκει τὸν θεὸν τοῖς κυμβάλοις ἄνθρωπος εἰς ὃ βούλεται, ὁ τοῦτο ποιῶν ἐστι μείζων τοῦ θεοῦ: ἀλλ̓ ἔστι τόλμης καὶ βίου 7 ταῦτ̓ ὄργανα εὑρημέν̓ ἀνθρώποισιν. 

If a man drags the Deity
Whither he will by the sound of cymbals,
He that does this is greater than the Deity;
But these are the instruments of audacity and means of living
Invented by men.

### s76
[p. 170] καὶ οὐχὶ μόνος ὁ Μένανδρος, ἀλλὰ καὶ Ὅμηρος καὶ Εὐριπίδης καὶ ἄλλοι συχνοὶ ποιηταὶ διελέγχουσιν ὑμῶν τοὺς θεοὺς καὶ λοιδορεῖσθαι οὐ δεδίασιν οὐδὲ καθ̓ ὁπόσον αὐτοῖς. αὐτίκα τὴν Ἀθηνᾶν ‘κυνάμυιαν’ καὶ τὸν Ἥφαιστον ‘ἀμφιγύην’ καλοῦσιν, τῇ δὲ Ἀφροδίτῃ ἡ Ἑλένη φησὶ μηκέτι σοῖσι πόδεσσιν ὑποστρέψειας Ὄλυμπον. 

And not only Menander, but Homer also, and Euripides, and other poets in great numbers, expose your gods, and are wont to rate them, and that soundly too. For instance, they call Aphrodite dog-fly, and Hephæstus a cripple. Helen says to Aphrodite:—

Your godship abdicate!
Renounce Olympus!

ἐπὶ δὲ τοῦ Διονύσου ἀναφανδὸν Ὅμηρος γράφει ὅς ποτε μαινομένοιο Διωνύσοιο τιθήνας σεῦε κατ̓ ἠγάθεον Νυσήιον: αἱ δ̓ ἅμα πᾶσαι θύσθλα χαμαὶ κατέχευαν ὑπ̓ ἀνδροφόνοιο Λυκούργου. 

And of Dionysus, Homer writes without reserve:—

He, mid their frantic orgies, in the groves
Of lovely Nyssa, put to shameful rout
The youthful Bacchus' nurses; they in fear,
Dropped each her thyrsus, scattered by the hand
Of fierce Lycurgus, with an ox-goad armed.

ἄξιος ὡς ἀληθῶς Σωκρατικῆς διατριβῆς ὁ Εὐριπίδης εἰς τὴν ἀλήθειαν ἀπιδὼν καὶ τοὺς θεατὰς ὑπεριδών, ποτὲ μὲν τὸν Ἀπόλλωνα, ὃς μεσομφάλους ἕδρας ναίει βροτοῖσι στόμα νέμων σαφέστατα, διελέγχων, κείνῳ πιθόμενος 8 τὴν τεκοῦσαν ἔκτανον, ἐκεῖνον ἡγεῖσθ̓ ἀνόσιον καὶ κτείνετε: 9 ἐκεῖνος ἥμαρτ̓, οὐκ ἐγώ, ἀμαθέστερος γ̓ ὢν 10 τοῦ καλοῦ καὶ τῆς δίκης, 

Worthy truly of the Socratic school is Euripides, who fixes his eye on truth, and despises the spectators of his plays. On one occasion, Apollo,

Who inhabits the sanctuary that is in the middle of the earth,
Dispensing most certain oracles to mortals,

is thus exposed:—

It was in obedience to him that I killed her who brought me forth;
Him do you regard as stained with guilt — put him to death;
It was he that sinned, not I, uninstructed as I was
In right and justice.

τοτὲ δ̓ ἐμμανῆ εἰσάγων Ἡρακλέα καὶ μεθύοντα ἀλλαχόθι καὶ ἄπληστον: πῶς γὰρ οὐχί; ὃς ἑστιώμενος τοῖς κρέασι [p. 172] χλωρὰ σῦκ̓ ἐπήσθιεν ἄμους᾿ ὑλακτῶν ὥστε βαρβάρῳ μαθεῖν. ἤδη δὲ ἐν Ἴωνι τῷ δράματι γυμνῇ τῇ κεφαλῇ ἐκκυκλεῖ τῷ θεάτρῳ τοὺς θεούς: 

He introduces Heracles, at one time mad, at another drunk and gluttonous. How should he not so represent the god who, when entertained as a , ate green figs to flesh, uttering discordant howls, that even his barbarian host remarked it? In his drama of Ion, too, he barefacedly brings the gods on the stage:—

πῶς οὖν δίκαιον τοὺς νόμους ὑμᾶς βροτοῖς γράψαντας αὐτοὺς ἀδικίας ὀφλισκάνειν; εἰ δ̓, οὐ γὰρ ἔσται, τῷ λόγῳ δὲ χρήσομαι, δίκας βιαίων δώσετ̓ ἀνθρώποις γάμων, σὺ καὶ Ποσειδῶν Ζεύς θ̓, ὃς οὐρανοῦ κρατεῖ, ναοὺς τίνοντες ἀδικίας κενώσετε.

How, then, is it right for you, who have given laws to mortals,
To be yourselves guilty of wrong?
And if — what will never take place, yet I will state the supposition —
You will give satisfaction to men for your adulteries,
You, Poseidon, and you, Zeus, the ruler of heaven, —
You will, in order to make recompense for your misdeeds,
Have to empty your temples.

1 [omitted material]. . .  (11) Now this work of mine is not a writing rhetorically constructed for display. It is a collection of my memoranda stored up for old age as a remedy against forgetfulness, truly an image and outline of those vividly animated discourses which I was privileged to hear and of those blessed and truly remarkable men. 

τούτων ὃ μὲν ἐπὶ τῆς Ἑλλάδος, ὁ Ἰωνικός, οἳ δὲ ἐπὶ τῆς Μεγάλης Ἑλλάδος (τῆς κοίλης θάτερος αὐτῶν Συρίας ἦν, ὃ δὲ ἀπ' Αἰγύπτου), ἄλλοι δὲ ἀνὰ τὴν

One of these men was an Ionian from Greece and the others from greater Greece [i.e. the Greek diaspora]. One from Coele-Syria, one from Egypt, and others from the East. One was born in the land of Assyria, another by origin a Hebrew from Palestine. 

When I met the last one (who was superior in power), having tracked him down in his hiding-place in Egypt, I found rest. 

Σικελικὴ τῷ ὄντι ἦν μέλιττα προφητικοῦ τε καὶ

He was the true, Sicilian bee, gathering from the flowers of the prophetic and apostolic meadow a pure substance of true knowledge (gnōsis) in the souls of his hearers.

But they preserved the tradition of the blessed teaching derived directly from the holy apostles, Peter, James, John, and Paul, the sons receiving it from the father (but few were like the fathers), came by God’s will to us also to plant those ancestral and apostolic seeds. . . [omitted material]

13 (57) Since truth is one (for the lie has ten thousand routes). Just as the female bacchic devotees tore off the limbs of Pentheus [Euripides, The Bacchai], so the sects (haireseis) of barbarian and Greek philosophy have ripped apart truth, and each sect confidently presents the part it obtained as the complete truth. In my opinion, everything is illuminated by the light of the rising sun. Therefore, let everyone, both Greeks and barbarians, who have reached for the truth (whether possessing quite a bit or just a part of truth) display whatever they have of the word of truth.

For instance, eternity presents in an instant the future and the present, as well as the past. But truth, being much more powerful than limitless time, can collect its seeds even though they have fallen on foreign soil. For we will find that so many thoughts held by such sects – at least those that have not become utterly senseless and are not cut out from the order of nature (by cutting off Christ, as the group of women did with the man [Pentheus]) – even though they appear unlike one another, correspond in their origin and with the truth as a whole. For they coincide in a unity, either as a part or a form or a class. For instance, though the highest note is different from the lowest note, both still create one harmony. With numbers, an even number differs from an odd number, but both are needed for math, and this is also the case with shapes: the circle, triangle, square, and whatever other shapes differ from one another. So also all the parts of the whole universe, though differing one from another, preserve their relation to the whole. So, then, barbarian and Greek philosophy has torn off a piece of eternal truth not from the stories about Dionysos, but from the discourses about God pertaining to the eternally existing word (logos) [identified with Jesus]. Whoever brings the separated pieces back together and makes them one, will without a doubt contemplate the perfect word, the truth.

Therefore it is written in Ecclesiastes 1:16-18: “I acquired wisdom that surpassed all others around me in Jerusalem, and my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge, parables and understanding.

This, too, is the choice of the spirit, because in abundance of wisdom is abundance of knowledge (gnōsis).” The one who is conversant with all kinds of wisdom will be, above all, one who knows (gnostikos). Now it is also written, “Abundance of the knowledge of wisdom will give life to him who is of it.” And, again, what this means is clarified by this saying, “All things are in the sight of those who understand” (all things, both Greek and barbarian; but one or the other alone is not complete) “ as is clear to those who wish to receive understanding. Choose instruction over silver, and knowledge above tested gold” (and prefer also perceptivity to pure gold), “for wisdom is better than precious stones, and no precious thing is as valuable as wisdom” [Proverbs 8:9-11].

The Greeks say that after Orpheus and Linos and the most ancient of the poets that appeared among them, the so-called “seven sages (sophoi)” were the first admired for their wisdom. Four of them were from Asia: Thales of Miletos, Bias of Priene, Pittakos of Mitylene, and Cleoboulos of Lindos. Two were from Europe: Solon the Athenian, and Chilon the Lakedaimonian. Some say the seventh was Periander of Corinth, others say Anacharsis the Scythian, and others say Epimenides the Cretan.

Paul knew the latter as a Greek prophet, mentioning him in the Epistle to Titus [1:12-13] where he speaks like this: “It was one of them, their very own prophet, who said, ‘Cretans are always liars, vicious beasts, lazy gluttons.’ That testimony is true.” Do you see how Paul even attributes something true to the prophets of the Greeks, and is not ashamed when building some of them up and shaming others, to make use of Greek poems? When writing to the Corinthians (for this is not the only instance) about the resurrection of the dead, he makes use of a iambic verse from tragedy, saying, “What advantage is it to me if the dead are not raised? Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die. Do not be deceived: ‘Bad company corrupts good character’” [1 Corinthians 15:31-32].)

Others have counted Akousilaos the Argive among the seven wise men, and others Pherekydes of Syros. And Plato substitutes Myso the Chenian for Periander, whom he deemed unworthy of wisdom, on account of his having reigned as a tyrant.

I will soon show that these Greek sages flourished after the time of Moses. Now we must consider how the style of the sages’ philosophy is Hebraic and enigmatic. They adopted brevity as suited for exhortation, and most helpful. 

Even Plato says that in the old days this mode was purposely in vogue among all the Greeks, especially the Lakedaimonians [Spartans] and Cretans, who had the best laws. Some attributed the expression, “know yourself” to Chilon. But Chamaileon, in his book On the Gods, ascribes it to Thales and Aristotle ascribes it to the Pythia [prophetess of the Delphic oracle]. It may be an injunction to the pursuit of knowledge. For it is not possible to know the parts without the essence of the whole, and one must study the origin of the universe in order to understand the nature of humanity.

Again, to Chilon the Lakedaimonian they attribute “let nothing be too much.” Strato, in his book On Inventions, ascribes this short saying to Stratodemos of Tegea but Didymos assigns it to Solon, and he attributes the saying “a middle course is best” to Cleoboulos. The expression “come under a pledge, and mischief is at hand,” Kleomenes says, in his book On Hesiod, was uttered before by Homer [Odyssey 8.351] in the lines: “pledges of the worthless are worthless pledges.” 

The Aristotelians consider this to be Chilon’s, but Didymus says the advice was that of Thales. Then, next in order, the saying “all men are bad” or “most men are bad” (for the same short saying is expressed in two ways), Sotades of Byzantion says that it belongs to Bias. And they attribute the aphorism “practice conquers everything” to Periander, as well as attributing the advice “know the opportunity” to Pittakos. Solon made laws for the Athenians, Pittakos for the Mitylenians. And at a late date, Pythagoras, the student of Pherekydes, first called himself a philosopher.

ὥσπερ οὐδὲ Φερεκύδου τοῦ Συρίου, ᾧ Πυθαγόρας ἐμαθήτευσεν. 

After these three men, there were three successions of philosophy named after the places where they were active: the Italian from Pythagoras, the Ionian from Thales, and the Eleatic from Xenophanes. Pythagoras was from Samos and was the son of Mnesarchos, as Hippobotos says. According to Aristoxenos, in his Life of Pythagoras, as well as Aristarchos and Theopompos, he was from Tyre. But according to Neanthes, Pythagoras was from Syria or Tyre. So according to most people, Pythagoras was a barbarian by descent.

Thales also was a Phoenician in the accounts of Leander and Herodotos record. Others suppose he was a Milesian. Thales alone seems to have met the prophets of the Egyptians. But no one is described as his teacher, nor is any one mentioned as the teacher of Pherekydes of Syros, who had Pythagoras as his student.

But the Italian philosophy, that of Pythagoras, stayed a long time in Metapontium in Italy. Anaximander of Miletos, the son of Praxiades, succeeded Thales; and was himself succeeded by Anaximenes of Miletos, the son of Eurystratos; after whom came Anaxagoras of Klazomenai, the son of Hegesiboulos. Anaxagoras transferred his school (diatribē) from Ionia to Athens. He was succeeded by Archelaos, and Socrates listened to him.

(“In fact, the stone-mason, the law-talker, and charmer of the Greeks,” says Timon in his Satirical Poems, because of his leaving physics for ethics.) Antisthenes, after being a student of Socrates, introduced the Cynic philosophy. Plato withdrew to the Academy. Aristotle, after studying philosophy under Plato, withdrew to the Lyceum, and founded the Peripatetic sect. He was succeeded by Theophrastos, who was succeeded by Strato, and he by Lykon, then Kritolaos, and then Diodoros. Speusippos was the successor of Plato, his successor was Xenokrates, and the successor of the latter was Polemo. The students of Polemo were Krates and Krantor, with whom the old Academy founded by Plato ended. Archesilaos was the associate of Krantor; from whom, down to Hegesilaos, the Middle Academy flourished.

Then Karneades succeeded Hegesilaos, and others came in succession. The student of Krates was Zeno of Kition, the founder of the Stoic sect. He was succeeded by Kleanthes; and the latter by Chrysippos, and others after him. Xenophanes of Kolophon was the founder of the Eleatic school, who, Timaeus says, lived in the time of Hiero, lord of Sicily, and Epicharmus the poet. Apollodoros says that he was born in the fortieth Olympiad [ca. 620 BCE], and reached to the times of Darius and Cyrus [kings of Persia]. 

Parmenides, accordingly, was the student of Xenophanes, and Zeno of him; then came Leukippos, and then Demokritos. Protagoras of Abdera and Metrodoros of Chios were students of Demokritos, and Diogenes of Smyrna was a student of Metrodoros, Anaxarchos under him, and so too Pyrrho, and from him Nausiphanes. Some say that Epicurus was a scholar of his. 

This, in summary, is the succession of the philosophers among the Greeks.

[Chronology to demonstrate Hebrew philosophy was much older than Greek philosophy]

I must next explain in order the chronology of these founders of philosophy in order to show that, by comparison, the Hebrew philosophy was older by many generations.

I have already said that Xenophanes was the founder of the Eleatic philosophy. In the Astrological Investigations, Eudemos [of Rhodes] says that Thales predicted the eclipse of the sun which took place at the time that the Medians and the Lydians fought, in the reign of Cyaxares the father of Astyages over the Medes, and the reign of Alyattos the son of Croesus who ruled over the Lydians. Herodotos in his first book agrees with him. The date is about the fiftieth Olympiad [ca. 580 BCE]. Pythagoras is ascertained to have lived in the days of Polykrates the tyrant, about the sixty-second Olympiad [ca. 532 BCE]. Mnesiphilos is described as a follower of Solon, and was a contemporary of Themistokles. Solon therefore flourished about the forty-sixth Olympiad [ca. 596 BCE]. For Heraclitos, the son of Bauso, persuaded Melankomas the tyrant to abdicate his sovereignty. He rejected the invitation of king Darius to visit the Persians.

These are the times of the oldest sages and philosophers among the Greeks. I hardly need to say that the majority of them were barbarians by extraction and educated by barbarians. Pythagoras is shown to have been either a Tuscan or a Tyrian; Antisthenes was a Phrygian; and, Orpheus was an Odrysian or a Thracian. Most also show Homer to have been an Egyptian. Thales was a Phoenician by birth, and was said to have interacted with the prophets of the Egyptians. Likewise Pythagoras interacted with the same people, by whom he was circumcised so that he could enter the most sacred part of the sanctuary (adyton) and learn from the Egyptians the mystical philosophy. He spoke with the best among the Chaldeans and the Magians, and he gave a hint of what we now call the “assembly” (ekklēsia) [of Jesus followers] in his gathering place for fellow-students (homakoeion) which he maintained.

Plato also does not deny that he imported from the barbarians everything that is best in philosophy, and he admits that he went to Egypt. So Plato writes in the Phaedo [78A] that the philosopher can receive help from all sides: “Great indeed is Greece, O Kebes, where there are good men everywhere, and many are the descent groups (genē) of the barbarians.”

So Plato thinks that some of the barbarians are also philosophers. But Epicurus, on the other hand, supposes that only Greeks can philosophize. In the Symposium [209 D-E], Plato praises barbarians as makers of good laws and correctly refers to: “different people in many different places, both among Greeks and barbarians, with many temples established through such fine children.” And it is clear that the barbarians especially honoured their lawgivers and teachers, designating them gods. For, according to Plato [Phaedrus 247 C], they think that good souls leave “the place beyond the heavens” and submit to coming into this Tartaros, taking on a body and sharing all the evils of birth in their care for the family of humankind. It was them who made laws and proclaimed philosophy: “No greater blessing ever came from the gods to humankind, or ever will” [Timaeus 47 A-B].

(1.68-72) It seems to me that it was because they perceived the great benefit which is brought by sages that the sages themselves were honoured and philosophy cultivated publicly by all the Brahmans [in India] and by all the Odrysians and Getians [in Thrace]. The people of the Egyptians, the Chaldeans [in Babylonia], the inhabitants of Arabia Felix (as it is called), the inhabitants of Palestine, a large portion of the Persian people, and many other peoples alongside them produced sacred discourses about those sages. . .

It is well known that Plato is always found praising the barbarians, remembering that both himself and Pythagoras learned the most and the noblest of their doctrines among the barbarians. For this reason, Plato also called the descent groups of the barbarians “descent groups of barbarian philosophers.” In the Phaedrus [274 E], Plato recognizes the Egyptian king and shows that he is wiser than the god Thoth (whom Plato knew as Hermes). But in the Charmides, it is evident that he knew certain Thracians who were said to make the soul immortal.

(69) Pythagoras is recorded as a student of Sonches, the highest prophet of the Egyptians; Plato is recorded as a student of Sechnyphis of Heliopolis; and, Eudoxos of Knidos is recorded as a student of Konyphis, who was also an Egyptian. In his book On the Soul, . . . [missing material]. Plato again clearly recognizes prophecy when he introduces a prophet announcing the word of Lachesis, uttering predictions to the souls whose destiny is becoming fixed. And in the Timaeus [22 B], Plato introduces the most wise Solon learning from the barbarian. The substance of the declaration is to the following effect: “O Solon, Solon, you Greeks are always children. And no Greek is an old man. For you have no learning that is grey with age”.

Demokritos appropriated the Babylonian ethical discourses, for he is said to have combined with his own compositions a translation of the inscription (stelē) of Akikaros. You may find the distinction notified by him when he writes, “thus says Demokritos.” About himself, too, where, bragging about his erudition, he says, “I have travelled the earth than any man of my time, investigating the most remote parts. I have seen the most skies and lands, and I have heard of learned men in very great numbers. And in composition no one has surpassed me. In demonstration, not even those among the Egyptians who are called Arpenodaptians, with whom I lived in exile eighty years, surpassed me.” For Demokritos went to Babylon, Persia, and Egypt, to learn from the Magians and the priests. 

Pythagoras was enthusiastic about Zoroaster, the Magian of Persia. Those who follow the sect (or: heresy) of Prodikos claim to possess the secret books of Zoroaster.

Herakleitos says that the sibyl [at Delphi] spoke not in a human way but by god’s aid. They say, accordingly, that at Delphi a stone was placed beside the oracle, and the first sibyl, who came from Helikon and was raised by the Muses, sat on it. But some say that she came from Malis, being the daughter of Lamia and granddaughter of Poseidon. In his epic verses, Serapion says that the sibyl contined her divination even after death. He writes that the air that came from her dead body was what caused oracular utterances in voices and omens. Furthermore, when her body decomposed into earth, a grass naturally grew out of it. Whatever animals happened to be there and ate the grass exhibited an accurate knowledge of the future by way of their entrails. He also thinks that the face seen in the moon is the sibyl’s soul.

Numa, the king of the Romans, was a Pythagorean and, aided by the precepts of Moses, prohibited from making an image of god in human form and making an image in the shape of a living creature.

Thus philosophy, a thing of the highest utility, flourished in antiquity among the barbarians, shedding its light on the peoples (ethnē). And afterwards it came to Greece.

First in its ranks were the prophets among the Egyptians; the Chaldeans among the Assyrians; the Druids among the Galatians; the Samanaians among the Bactrians; those who philosophize among the Celts; and, the Magians of the Persians, who predicted the saviour’s birth, and came into the land of Judea guided by a star. The naked sages (gymnosophists) among the Indians are also in the number, and the other barbarian philosophers. 

διττὸν δὲ τούτων τὸ γένος, οἳ μὲν Σαρμᾶναι αὐτῶν, οἳ δὲ Βραχμᾶναι καλούμενοι. 

There are two types [among the Indians], some called Sarmanians and the others Brahmans. 

καὶ τῶν Σαρμανῶν οἱ ὑλόβιοι προσαγορευόμενοι οὔτε πόλεις οἰκοῦσιν οὔτε στέγας ἔχουσιν, δένδρων δὲ ἀμφιέννυνται φλοιοῖς καὶ ἀκρόδρυα σιτοῦνται καὶ ὕδωρ ταῖς χερσὶ πίνουσιν, οὐ γάμον, οὐ παιδοποιίαν 1.15.71.6 ἴσασιν, ὥσπερ οἱ νῦν Ἐγκρατηταὶ καλούμενοι. 

The Sarmanians are also called Hylobians. Neither of the types inhabit cities, nor live in houses. Instead, they are clothed in the bark of trees, they feed on nuts, and they drink water in their hands. Just like those called Encratites today, they do not marry or have children.

Anacharsis was a Scythian, and it is recorded that he was superior to many Greek philosophers. And the Hyperboreans, Hellanikos relates, lived beyond the Riphaean mountains. They learned justice and did not eat meat, but rather nuts. They take everyone who is over sixty years old outside the gates and kill them. There are also among the Germans those called sacred women, who predict future events by inspecting the whirlpools of rivers and the eddies and by listening to the sounds of streams. These women did not allow the men to fight against [Julius] Caesar until the new moon shone.

[Judeans as the oldest barbarian people]

Among all these peoples, by far the most ancient is the Judean descent group (genos). Philo the Pythagorean (along with Aristoboulos the Peripatetic and several others who I will not name to save time here) shows that the philosophy of the Judeans was put into writing before Greek philosophy. The author Megasthenes, a contemporary of Seleukos Nikanor [reigned ca. 305-281 BCE], clearly writes as follows in the third section of his book On Indian Matters: “All that was said about nature by the ancients is said also by philosophers outside of Greece, some things by the Brahmans among the Indians and others by those called Judeans in Syria.”

Some of those more inclined to legends say that certain so-called Dactyls of Ida [a mountain on Crete] were the first sages, to whom are attributed the invention of so-called “Ephesian letters” and musical rhythms. For this reason “dactyls” in music received their name. Now the Dactyls of Ida were Phrygians and barbarians. Herodoros [of Herakleia, fifth century BCE] relates that Herakles was a seer and a student of physics [within philosophy] who received the columns of the universe from the barbarian Atlas, the Phrygian, a story which means that he was taught knowledge of the heavenly bodies. Hermippos of Berytos [early second century CE] calls Charon the Centaur wise, about whom the person who wrote The Battle of Giants says, “that he first led the race of mortals to righteousness by teaching them the solemnity of the oath, propitiatory sacrifices, and the figures of Olympos.” Achilles, who fought at Troy, was taught by Charon. Hippo, the daughter of the Centaur, who dwelt with Aiolus, taught him her father’s theory of physics. Euripides also refers to Hippo as follows: “Who first, by oracles, presaged, and by the rising stars, events divine.” 

By this Aeolos, Odysseus was received as a guest after the taking of Troy. Take note of these dates in comparison with the age of Moses, and with the oldest period of philosophy contemporary with Moses.

Barbarians were inventors not only of philosophy but also of almost of every technical skill. Egyptians were the first to introduce astrology among men, and similarly with Chaldeans. The Egyptians first showed how to burn lamps, divided the year into twelve months, prohibited intercourse with women in temples, and proscribed entry into the temples after contact with a woman without purification. They were also the inventors of land-measurement (geōmetria). There are some who say that the Carians invented prediction based on the stars. The Phrygians were the first who paid attention to the flight of birds. And the Tuscans, neighbours of Italy, paid special attention to sacrifice. The Isaurians and the Arabians invented augury, as the Telmessians divination by dreams. The Tyrrhenians [sometimes identified with Etruscans] invented the trumpet and the Phrygians the flute. For Olympos and Marsyas were Phrygians.

As Ephoros says, Kadmos was a Phoenician who invented letters among the Greeks, and this is why Herodotos [5.58] writes that they were called “Phoenician letters.” They say that the Phoenicians and the Syrians first invented letters. Apis, an indigenous Egyptian, invented medicine before Io came into Egypt. But afterwards they say that Asklepios improved the technical skill. Atlas the Libyan was the first who built a ship and navigated the sea. Kelmis and Damnaneus, Dactyls of Ida, first discovered iron in Cyprus. Another Idaean discovered the tempering of brass, according to Hesiod, a Scythian. The Thracians first invented what is called an harpē (a curved blade), and they were the first to use shields on horseback. Similarly also the Illyrians invented the round shield called the parma. Besides, they say that the Tuscans invented sculpting with clay, and that Itanus (who was a Samnite) first fashioned the oblong shield. Kadmos the Phoenician invented stone-cutting and discovered the gold mines on the Pangaean mountain. Further, another people, the Cappadocians, first invented the stringed instrument called the nabla, and the Assyrians did the same with the two-stringed instrument (dichord). The Carthaginians were the first that constructed a vessel with four banks of oars (quadrireme), and this was built by Bosporos, who was indigenous.

Medea, the daughter of Aietas, a Colchian [modern Georgia], first invented the dyeing of hair. Besides, the Noropians (they are a Paionian descent group, and are now called Noricum [modern Austria and Slovenia]) worked copper, and were the first that purified iron. Amykos the king of the Bebrykians was the first inventor of boxing-gloves.

In music, Olympos the Mysian practised the Lydian harmony. The people called Troglodytes invented the sambuca, a musical instrument. It is said that the crooked pipe was invented by Satyros the Phrygian; likewise also diatonic harmony was invented by Hyagnis, a Phrygian too. Notes were invented by Olympos, a Phrygian; as also the Phrygian harmony, the half-Phrygian scale, and the half-Lydian scale, by Marsyas, who belonged to the same region as those mentioned above. The Doric scale was invented by Thamyris the Thracian.

We have heard that the Persians were the first who fashioned the chariot, bed, and footstool. The Sidonians were the first to construct a vessel with three banks of oars (trireme). The Sicilians, close to Italy, were the first inventors of the phorminx, which is not much inferior to the lyre, and they invented castanets. In the time of Semiramis queen of the Assyrians, they relate that linen garments were invented. And Hellanikos says that Atossa queen of the Persians was the first who composed a letter.

These things are reported by Scamon of Mitylene [FGrHist 3 B 475], Theophrastos of Ephesos, Kydippos of Mantineia, Antiphanes, Aristodemos [FGrHist 3 B 383] and Aristotle, as well as Philostephanos and Strato the Peripatetic in his books On Inventions. I have added a few details from them in order to confirm the inventive and practical ability of the barbarians. The lifestyles of the Greeks have been improved by them. And if any one objects to barbarian language, Anacharsis says, “All the Greeks speak Scythian to me” [Epistle 1]. Anacharsis was held in admiration by the Greeks. He said, “My covering is a cloak; my supper, milk and cheese” [Epistle 5]. Do you see that the barbarian philosophy offers actions rather than words?

The apostle [Paul] says this: “So with yourselves, if you utter speech in a tongue that is not intelligible, how will any one know what is said? For you will be speaking into air. There are doubtless many different languages in the world, and none is without meaning. But if I do not know the meaning of the language, I will be a barbarian to the speaker and the speaker a barbarian to me. . . Therefore, he who speaks in a tongue should pray for the power to interpret.” [1 Corinthians 14.9-11, 13 [RSV adapted].

[Skills in oral instruction and in writing came late to the Greeks]

Yes, and skills in oral instruction and writing entered Greece late. Alkmaion, the son of Perithos, of Krotona [ca. sixth century BCE], first composed a treatise on nature. And it is related that Anaxagoras of Klazomenai, the son of Hegesiboulos, first published a book in writing. The first to adapt music to poetical compositions was Terpander of Antissa [ca. seventh century BCE], and he set the laws of the Lakedaimonians [Spartans] to music. Lasos of Hermione [ca. sixth century BCE] invented the choral hymn (dithyramb); Stesichoros of Himera [ca. sixth century BCE], the hymn; Alkman the Spartan, the choral song; Anakreon of Teos [ca. sixth century BCE], love songs; Pindar the Theban [ca. 518-438 BCE], the dance accompanied with song. Timotheus of Miletos [ca. 450-360 BCE] was the first to execute those musical compositions called “nomoi” on the lyre, with dancing.

Moreover, Archilochos of Paros invented iambic poetry, and Hipponax of Ephesos invented “limping iambic” poetry. Tragedy owed its origin to Thespis of Athens [ca. 535-533 BCE], and comedy to Susarion of Ikaria [ca. 581-560 BCE]. Their dates are handed down by the grammarians. But it would be tedious to represent them accurately. resently, however, Dionysos, on whose account the Dionysian spectacles are celebrated, is later than Moses. They say that Antiphon [ca. 480-411 BCE] of Rhamnous, the son of Sophilos, first invented ethical exhortation and rhetorical figures, and was the first to compose a legal defence for a fee, and wrote a forensic speech for delivery, as Diodoros says. Apollodoros of Kyme first assumed the name of critic, and was called a grammarian. Some say it was Eratosthenes of Cyrene [ca. 275-194 BCE] who was first called a grammarian, since he published two books which he entitled Grammatical Matters. The first who was called a grammarian, as we now use the term, was Praxiphanes, the son of Dionysophenes of Mitylene. Zeleukos the Lokrian was reported to have been the first legislator. Others say that it was Menos the son of Zeus, in the time of Lynkeus. He comes after Danaos, in the eleventh generation from Inachos and Moses, as we will show a little further on. And Lykourgus, who lived many years after the taking of Troy, legislated for the Lakedaimonians a hundred and fifty years before the Olympiads. We have spoken before about the time of Solon.

(80) Drakon, who was also a legislator, has his birth recorded in around the thirty-ninth Olympiad [ca. 624 BCE]. Antilochos, who wrote about the learned men from the age of Pythagoras to the death of Epicurus, which took place in the tenth day of the month Gamelion, makes up altogether three hundred and twelve years [i.e. ca. 582-271 BCE]. Moreover, some say that Phanothea, the wife of Ikarios, invented the heroic hexameter; others say it was Themis, one of the Titanides. However, in his work On the Pythagorean Philosophy, Didymos relates that Theano of Kroton was the first woman philosopher and composer of poetry.

[Conclusion about Greek philosophy]

According to some, Greek philosophy in one way or another teaches the truth accidentally, obscurely, and partially. Others would have it started by the devil (diabolos). Several suppose that certain powers descended to inspire all philosophy [cf. 1 Enoch 1-36]. But even if Greek philosophy does not fully comprehend the extent of the truth and, furthermore, is too weak to fulfill the commandments of the Lord, it nonetheless prepares the way for the truly royal teaching. In some way or another, it offers training, shapes character, and prepares the person who believes in Providence to receive the truth.

Further, Onomacritus the Athenian, who is said to have been the author of the poems ascribed to Orpheus, is ascertained to have lived in the reign of the Pisistratidae, about the fiftieth Olympiad. 

Ὀρφεὺς δὲ, ὁ συμπλεύσας 1.21.131.2 

Ἡρακλεῖ, Μουσαίου διδάσκαλος· 

And Orpheus, who sailed with Hercules, was the pupil of Musaeus. 

Ἀμφίων γὰρ δυσὶ προάγει γενεαῖς τῶν Ἰλιακῶν, 

Amphion precedes the Trojan war by two generations. 

∆ημόδοκος δὲ καὶ Φήμιος μετὰ τὴν Ἰλίου ἅλωσιν ὃ μὲν γὰρ παρὰ τοῖς Φαίαξιν, ὃ δὲ

παρὰ τοῖς μνηστῆρσι) κατὰ τὸ 1.21.131.3 κιθαρίζειν εὐδοκίμουν. 

And Demodocus and Phemius were posterior to the capture of Troy; for they were famed for playing on the lyre, the former among the Phaeacians, and the latter among the suitors. 

καὶ τοὺς μὲν

Προδίκου1.21.131.4 τοῦ Σαμίου. 

And the Oracles ascribed to Musaeus are said to be the production of Onomacritus, and the Crateres of Orpheus the production of Zopyrus of Heraclea, and The Descent to Hades that of Prodicus of Samos. 

Ἴων δὲ ὁ Χῖος ἐν τοῖς Τριαγμοῖς καὶ Πυθαγόραν εἰς

1.21.131.5 Ὀρφέα ἀνενεγκεῖν τινα ἱστορεῖ. 

Ion of Chios relates in the Triagmi, that Pythagoras ascribed certain works [of his own] to Orpheus. 

Ἐπιγένης δὲ ἐν τοῖς Περὶ τῆς εἰς Ὀρφέα

ποιήσεως Κέρκωπος εἶναι λέγει τοῦ Πυθαγορείου τὴν Εἰς Ἅιδου κατάβασιν καὶ τὸν

Ἱερὸν λόγον, τὸν δὲ Πέπλον καὶ τὰ Φυσικὰ 1.21.131.6 Βροντίνου. 

Epigenes, in his book respecting The Poetry attributed to Orpheus, says that The Descent to Hades and the Sacred Discourse were the production of Cecrops the Pythagorean; and the Peplus and the Physics of Brontinus. 

ναὶ μὴν καὶ

Τέρπανδρον ἀρχαΐζουσί τινες· 

Some also make Terpander out ancient. 

Ἑλλάνικος γοῦν τοῦτον ἱστορεῖ κατὰ Μίδαν

νεώτερον φέρει τὸν Τέρπανδρον, διημιλλῆσθαι δὲ τὸν Λέσχην Ἀρκτίνῳ καὶ

νενικηκέναι· 

Hellanicus, accordingly, relates that he lived in the time of Midas: but Phanias, who places Lesches the Lesbian before Terpander, makes Terpander younger than Archilochus, and relates that Lesches contended with Arctinus, and gained the victory. 

1.21.131.7 Ξάνθος δὲ ὁ Λυδὸς περὶ τὴν ὀκτωκαιδεκάτην ὀλυμπιάδα (ὡς

Ἀρχίλοχον μετὰ τὴν εἰκοστὴν ἤδη γνωρίζεσθαι ὀλυμπιάδα. 

Xanthus the Lydian says that he lived about the eighteenth Olympiad; as also Dionysius says that Thasus was built about the fifteenth Olympiad: so that it is clear that Archilochus was already known after the twentieth Olympiad. 

μέμνηται γοῦν καὶ τῆς

Μαγνήτων ἀπωλείας προσφάτως γεγενημένης. 

He accordingly relates the destruction of Magnetes as having recently taken place. 

1.21.131.8 Σιμωνίδης μὲν οὖν κατὰ

Ἀρχίλοχον φέρεται, 

Simonides is assigned to the time of Archilochus. 

Καλλῖνος δὲ πρεσβύτερος οὐ μακρῷ· τῶν γὰρ Μαγνήτων ὁ μὲν

Ἀρχίλοχος ἀπολωλότων, ὃ δὲ εὐημερούντων μέμνηται· 

Callinns is not much older; for Archilochus refers to Magnetes as destroyed, while the latter refers to it as flourishing. 

Εὔμηλος δὲ ὁ Κορίνθιος

πρεσβύτερος ὢν ἐπιβεβληκέναι Ἀρχίᾳ τῷ Συρακούσας κτίσαντι.

Eumelus of Corinth being older, is said to have met Archias, who founded Syracuse.

Quoniam autem," inquit, "nati volunt vivere, et mortes habere, vel potius quiescere; filios quoque relinquunt, ut mortes fiant." Clarum est autem cum eo conyenire Empedoclem quoque dicentem: Deflevi et luxi, insolitum cernens miser orbem.


Et amplius: Mortua ham ex vivis fecit, species commutans.

Et rursus: Hei mihi! quam infelix horninure genus atque misellum Litibus ex quantis prognati et planctibus estis?

Dicit autem Sibylla quoque: Mortales homines, caro qui tantum, et nihil estis; Similiter atque poem, qui scribit: Haud homine infelix tellus mage quldquam aHt alma.

Quin etiam Theognis malam ostendit esse generationera, dicens hoc modo: Optima non nasci res est mortalibus aegris, Nec nitidi soils luce micante frui, Extemplo aut natum portas invadere Ditis.

It is clear that Heraclitus regards birth as something evil when he says: "When men are born they are fain to live and suffer death," or rather go to their rest, "and they leave children who also suffer death."  Empedocles is obviously in agreement with him when he says:
"When I saw the place, so strange it was, I wept and wailed."
And further:
"For out of the living he made the dead, changing their forms."
And again;
"0 woe, unhappy race of mortals, wretched men!
Out of what kind of dissensions and groans were you born!”
And the Sibyl also says:
"Mortal men are ye, and fleshly, being nothing," like the poet who writes:
"Earth nurtures nothing weaker than a man.

His autem consequenria scribit quoque Euripides, poem tragicus: Nam nos decebat convenire publice, et Deftere natum, quod tot ingreditur mala:

Ast mortuum, cuique jam quies data est, Efferre laetis gratulationibus.

Et rursus similia sic dicit: Quis novit, an vivere quidera siet mori, Siet mori autem vivere?

Moreover Theognis shows that birth is evil when he
speaks as follows:
"For mortals best it is not to be born at all
And never to see the rays of the bright sun,
But if born to pass the gates of Hades as soon as possible."
With this agrees also the tragic poet Euripides when he writes:
"Where a man is born we ought to assemble only to bewail His lot in coming into so much evil.
But when one dies and comes to the end of troubles
Then we should rejoice and praise his happy departure."
And again he says the same in these words:
"Who knows if life be not in truth but death And death be life.

3.3.16.1 ταὐτὸν δὴ τούτοις φαίνεται καὶ Ἡρόδοτος ποιῶν λέγοντα τὸν Σόλωνα·

θάνατον δὲ ἐπαινεῖν. 

Idem quod hi, videtur Herodotus quoque inducere dicentem Solonera: "0 Croese, quivis homo nihil est aliud quam calamitas." Jam veto ejus de Cleobide et Bitone fabula plane nihil aliud vult, quam vituperare generationera, laudare autern morterm.

Herodotus, it is clear, makes Solon say the same as this: "0 Croesus, every man is a misfortune." And his myth about Cleobis and Biton has obviously no other intention than to disparage birth and praise death. " As scattered leaves, so is mankind," says Homer.41 And in the Cratylus Plato attributes to Orpheus the doctrine that the soul in this body is suffering punishment. This is what he says: "Some say that the body is a tomb of the soul, as being buried in it for the present life. And because the soul expresses (semainei) by this body whatever it may wish to express, so it is rightly called a tomb (sema). The Orphics, in particular, seem to have given it this name, as they think the soul suffers punishment for its misdeeds,

See Λόγος Στρώματα Κλήμεντος του Ἀλεξανδρέως III 3, 24, 2 (II 206, 22 Staeh.) on the Pythagoreans:

ταύτηι μυστικῶς ἀπαγορεύουσι κυάμοις χρῆσθαι, οὐχ ὅτι πνευματοποιὸν καὶ δύσπεπτον καὶ τοὺς ὀνείρους τεταραγμένους ποιεῖ τὸ ὄσπριον, οὐδὲ μὴν ὅτι ἀνθρώπου κεφαλῆι ἀπείκασται κύαμος κατὰ τὸ ἐπύλλιον ἐκεῖνο·

« ἶσόν τοι κυάμους τρώγειν (see verse below Athen.) κεφαλάς τε τοκήων. »

“Thus they mystically forbid them to use beans, not because they produce flatulence, are hard to digest, and that pulse produces troubled dreams, nor because the bean resembles the head of a man, in accordance with that verse:

‘It is the same to eat beans and the heads of one’s parents.’ ”

(trans. by the author)

Compare on the use of the words ἐσθίειν (“to eat”) and τρώγειν (“to nibble”) in the New Testament Haußleiterum Archiv für lateinische Lexikographie und Grammatik mit Einschluß des älteren Mittelalters IX 1896, 300.

μᾶλλον δὲ ὅτι κύαμοι

3.3.24.3 Θεόφραστος γοῦν ἐν τῷ

πέμπτῳ τῶν Φυτικῶν αἰτίων τὰ κελύφη τῶν κυάμων περὶ τὰς ῥίζας τῶν νεοφύτων

δένδρων περιτιθέμενα ξηραίνειν τὰ φυόμενα ἱστορεῖ, καὶ αἱ κατοικίδιοι δὲ ὄρνιθες

συνεχῶς ταῦτα σιτούμεναι ἄτοκοι γίνονται. 

Hac itaque ratione dicunt etiam Pythagoreos abstinere a rebus venereis. Mihi autem contra videntur uxores quidem ducere, ut liberos suscipiant, velle autem a venerea voluptate se continere post susceptos liberos. Proinde mystice uti fabis prohibent, non quod sit legumen flatum excitens, et concoctu difficile, et somnia efficiat turbulenta; neque quod hominis capiti sit sireills ut vult ille versiculus: Idem est namque fabam atque caput corrodere patris; sed potius quod fabae, si comedantur, steriles efficiant mulieres. 

It is asserted that on this ground the Pythagoreans exercised abstinence. But to me, on the contrary, it seems that they marry for the sake of procreating children, but after they have begotten children they desire to control sexual indulgence. That is why they give the mysterious command to abstain from beans, not because pulse leads to flatulence and is indigestible and causes troubled dreams, nor because the bean is shaped like a man's head; as the verse has it, "It is alike to eat beans and the head of one's parents." The real reason is that if beans are eaten they make women barren. At any rate Theophrastus in the fifth book of his Causes of Plants relates that if the pods of beans are put round the roots of newly planted trees the shoots dry up and that if birds that live round houses are continuously fed on beans they become unable to lay eggs.

οἳ δέ, διὰ τὸ μῖσος τὸ πρὸς τὴν σάρκα τῆς κατὰ γάμον συναλλαγῆς καὶ τῆς τῶν καθηκόντων βρωμάτων μεταλήψεως ἀχαρίστως ἀπαλλάττεσθαι ποθοῦντες, ἀμαθεῖς τε καὶ ἄθεοι, ἀλόγως ἐγκρατευόμενοι, καθάπερ τὰ πλεῖστα τῶν ἄλλων 3.7.60.2 ἐθνῶν. 

But those who from a hatred for the flesh ungratefully long to have nothing to do with the marriage union and the eating of reasonable food, are both blockheads and atheists, and exercise an irrational chastity like the other heathen. 

Βραχμᾶναι γοῦν οὔτε ἔμψυχον ἐσθίουσιν οὔτε οἶνον πίνουσιν· ἀλλ' οἳ μὲν αὐτῶν καθ' ἑκάστην ἡμέραν ὡς ἡμεῖς τὴν τροφὴν προσίενται, ἔνιοι δ' αὐτῶν διὰ τριῶν ἡμερῶν, ὥς φησιν Ἀλέξανδρος ὁ Πολυΐστωρ ἐν τοῖς Ἰνδικοῖς· καταφρονοῦσι δὲ θανάτου καὶ παρ' οὐδὲν ἡγοῦνται τὸ ζῆν· πείθονται γὰρ εἶναι παλιγγενεσίαν, θεοὺς δὲ 3.7.60.3 σέβουσιν Ἡρακλέα καὶ Πᾶνα. 

For example, the Brahmans neither eat animal flesh nor drink wine. But some of them take food every way, as we do, while others do so only on every third day, as Alexander Polyhistor says in his Indian History. They despise deaths and reckon life of no account. For they are persuaded that there is a regeneration. The gods they worship are Heracles and Pan. 

οἱ καλούμενοι δὲ Σεμνοὶ τῶν Ἰνδῶν γυμνοὶ διαιτῶνται τὸν πάντα βίον· οὗτοι τὴν ἀλήθειαν ἀσκοῦσι καὶ περὶ τῶν μελλόντων προμηνύουσι καὶ σέβουσί τινα πυραμίδα, ὑφ' 3.7.60.4 ἣν ὀστέα τινὸς θεοῦ νομίζουσιν ἀποκεῖσθαι. 

And the Indians who are called Holy Men go naked throughout their entire life. They seek for the truth, and predict the future, and reverence a certain pyramid beneath which, they think, lie the bones of a certain god. 

οὔτε δὲ οἱ γυμνοσοφισταὶ οὔθ' οἱ λεγόμενοι Σεμνοὶ γυναιξὶ χρῶνται· παρὰ φύσιν γὰρ τοῦτο καὶ παράνομον δοκοῦσι, δι' ἣν αἰτίαν σφᾶς αὐτοὺς ἁγνοὺς τηροῦσι,  παρθενεύουσι δὲ καὶ αἱ Σεμναί. δοκοῦσι δὲ παρατηρεῖν τὰ οὐράνια καὶ διὰ τῆς τούτων σημειώσεως τῶν μελλόντων προμαντεύεσθαί τινα.

Neither the Gymnosophists nor the so-called Holy Men have wives. They think sexual relations are unnatural and contrary to law. For this cause they keep themselves chaste. The Holy Women are also virgins. They observe, it seems, the heavenly bodies and from what they indicate foretell future events.

(3.94, this paragraph adapted from McCrindle’s translation) The Brahmans neither eat any living thing nor drink wine. Some of them eat food every day, like ourselves, while others among eat once every three days, as Alexander Polyhistor relates in his Indian Matters. They despise death, and set no value on life because they are persuaded that there is a new birth. They worship Herakles and Pan. But those Indians who are called Semnians (Semnai) [compare his reference to Sarmanians above] go naked all their lives. The Semnians practise truth, make predictions about the future, and worship a kind of pyramid beneath which they think the bones of some divinity lie buried. But neither the naked sages (gymnosophists) nor the Semnians have sex with women, because they regard this as contrary to nature and unlawful. For this reason, they keep themselves chaste. The Semnians, too, remain virgins. They observe closely the heavenly bodies and, by the indications about future which these offer, make some predictions.

In the same way, too, the Pythagoreans figuratively called the planets the "dogs of Persephone;" and to the sea they applied the metaphorical appellation of "the tears of Kronus." Myriads on myriads of enigmatical utterances by both poets and philosophers are to be found; and there are also whole books which present the mind of the writer veiled, as that of Heraclitus On Nature, who on this very account is called "Obscure."

Before handling the point proposed, we must, by way of preface, add to the close of the fifth book what is wanting. For since we have shown that the symbolical style was ancient, and was employed not only by our prophets, but also by the majority of the ancient Greeks, and by not a few of the rest of the Gentile Barbarians, it was requisite to proceed to the mysteries of the initiated. I postpone the elucidation of these till we advance to the confutation of what is said by the Greeks on first principles; for we shall show that the mysteries belong to the same branch of speculation. And having proved that the declaration of Hellenic thought is illuminated all round by the truth, bestowed on us in the Scriptures, taking it according to the sense, we have proved, not to say what is invidious, that the theft of the truth passed to them.

Come, and let us adduce the Greeks as witnesses against themselves to the theft. For, inasmuch as they pilfer from one another, they establish the fact that they are thieves; and although against their will, they are detected, clandestinely appropriating to those of their own race the truth which belongs to us. For if they do not keep their hands from each other, they will hardly do it from our authors. I shall say nothing of philosophic dogmas, since the very persons who are the authors of the divisions into sects, confess in writing, so as not to be convicted of ingratitude, that they have received from Socrates the most important of their dogmas. But after availing myself of a few testimonies of men most talked of, and of repute among the Greeks, and exposing their plagiarizing style, and selecting them from various periods, I shall turn to what follows.

6.2.5.3 Ὀρφέως τοίνυν ποιήσαντος· ὣς οὐ

κύντερον ἦν καὶ ῥίγιον ἄλλο γυναικός, 

Orpheus, then, having composed the line: "Since nothing else is more shameless and wretched than woman,"

6.2.5.4 Ὅμηρος ἄντικρυς λέγει· ὣς οὐκ

αἰνότερον καὶ κύντερον ἄλλο γυναικός. 

Homer plainly says: "Since nothing else is more dreadful and shameless than a woman."

6.2.5.5 Γράψαντός τε Μουσαίου· ὡς αἰεὶ

τέχνη μέγ' ἀμείνων ἰσχύος ἐστίν, 

And Musaeus having written: "Since art is greatly superior to strength,"

6.2.5.6 Ὅμηρος λέγει μήτι τοι δρυτόμος περιγίνεται

ἠὲ βίηφι. 

Homer says: "By art rather than strength is the woodcutter greatly superior."

6.2.5.7 Πάλιν τοῦ Μουσαίου ποιήσαντος· ὡς δ' αὔτως καὶ φύλλα φύει

ζείδωρος ἄρουρα· ἄλλα μὲν ἐν μελίῃσιν ἀποφθίνει, ἄλλα δὲ φύει· ὣς δὲ καὶ

ἀνθρώπων γενεὴν καὶ φῦλον ἑλίσσει. 

Again, Musaeus having composed the lines: "And as the fruitful field produceth leaves, And on the ash trees some fade, others grow, So whirls the race of man its leaf,"

6.2.5.8 Ὅμηρος μεταγράφει· φύλλα τὰ μέν τ' 

ἄνεμος χαμάδις χέει, ἄλλα δέ θ' ὕλη τηλεθόωσα φύει, ἔαρος δ' ἐπιγίνεται ὥρη· ὣς

ἀνδρῶν γενεὴ ἣ μὲν φύει, ἣ δ' ἀπολήγει. 

Homer transcribes: "Some of the leaves the wind strews on the ground.

The budding wood bears some; in time of spring, They come. So springs one race of men, and one departs."

6.2.5.9 Πάλιν δ' αὖ Ὁμήρου εἰπόντος· οὐχ

ὁσίη κταμένοισιν ἐπ' ἀνδράσιν εὐχετάασθαι, 

Again, Homer having said: "It is unholy to exult over dead men,"

6.2.5.10 Ἀρχίλοχός τε καὶ Κρατῖνος

γράφουσιν, ὃ μέν· οὐ γὰρ ἐσθλὰ κατθανοῦσι κερτομεῖν ἐπ' ἀνδράσιν, 6.2.5.11

Κρατῖνος δὲ ἐν τοῖς Λάκωσι· φοβερὸν ἀνθρώποις τόδ' αὖ, κταμένοις ἐπ' αἰζηοῖσιν

καυχᾶσθαι μέγα. 

Archilochus and Cratinus write, the former: "It is not noble at dead men to sneer;" and Cratinus in the Lacones: "For men 'tis dreadful to exult Much o'er the stalwart dead."

6.2.6.1 Αὖθίς τε ὁ Ἀρχίλοχος τὸ Ὁμηρικὸν ἐκεῖνο μεταφέρων·

ἀασάμην, οὐδ' αὐτὸς ἀναίνομαι· ἀντί νυ πολλῶν, 6.2.6.2 ὧδέ πως γράφει· ἤμβλακον, 

καί πού τινα ἄλλον ἥδ' ἄτη κιχήσατο· 

Again, Archilochus, transferring that Homeric line: "I erred, nor say I nay: -- instead of many" writes thus: "I erred, and this mischief hath somehow seized another."

6.2.6.3 καθάπερ ἀμέλει κἀκεῖνο τὸ ἔπος· ξυνὸς

ἐνυάλιος, 

As certainly also that line: "Evenhanded war the slayer slays."

καί τε κτανέοντα κατέκτα, 6.2.6.4 μεταποιῶν αὐτὸς ὧδέ πως ἐξήνεγκεν· † 

ἔρξω· ἐτήτυμον γὰρ ξυνὸς ἀνθρώποισιν Ἄρης. 6.2.6.5 ἔτι κἀκεῖνο μεταφράζων· νίκης

ἀνθρώποισιν θεῶν ἐν † πείρᾳ κεῖται, 

He also, altering, has given forth thus: "I will do it. For Mars to men in truth is evenhanded."

6.2.6.6 διὰ τοῦδε τοῦ ἰάμβου δῆλός ἐστι· καὶ

νέους θάρρυνε, νίκης δὲ ἐν θεοῖσι πείρατα. 6.2.7.1 Πάλιν Ὁμήρου εἰπόντος·

ἀνιπτόποδες, χαμαιεῦναι, 6.2.7.2 Εὐριπίδης ἐν Ἐρεχθεῖ γράφει· ἐν ἀστρώτῳ πέδῳ

εὕδουσιν, πηγαῖς δ' οὐχ ὑγραίνουσι<ν> πόδας. 

Also, translating the following: "The issues of victory among men depend on the gods," he openly encourages youth, in the following iambic: "Victory's issues on the gods depend." Again, Homer having said: "With feet unwashed sleeping on the ground," Euripides writes in Erechteus: "Upon the plain spread with no couch they sleep Nor m the streams of water lave their feet."

6.2.7.3 Ἀρχιλόχου τε ὁμοίως

εἰρηκότος· ἀλλ' ἄλλος ἄλλῳ κραδίην ἰαίνεται, 6.2.7.4 παρὰ τὸ Ὁμηρικόν· ἄλλος γάρ

<τ'> ἄλλοισιν ἀνὴρ ἐπιτέρπεται ἔργοις, 6.2.7.5 Εὐριπίδης ἐν τῷ Οἰνεῖ φησιν· ἀλλὰ

ἄλλος ἄλλοις μᾶλλον ἥδεται τρόποις. 

Archilochus having likewise said: "But one with this and one with that His heart delights? in correspondence with the Homeric line: "For one in these deeds, one in those delights," Euripides says in OEneus: "But one in these ways, one in those, has more delight."

6.2.7.6 Ἀκήκοα δὲ Αἰσχύλου μὲν λέγοντος·

οἴκοι μένειν χρὴ τὸν καλῶς εὐδαίμονα– καὶ τὸν κακῶς πράσσοντα καὶ τοῦτον

μένειν, 

And I have heard Aeschylus saying: "He who is happy ought to stay at home; There should he also stay, who speeds not well."

6.2.7.7 Εὐριπίδου δὲ τὰ ὅμοια ἐπὶ τῆς σκηνῆς βοῶντος· μακάριος ὅστις εὐτυχῶν οἴκοι μένει, 

And Euripides, too, shouting the like on the stage: Happy the man who, prosperous, stays at home."

6.2.7.8 ἀλλὰ καὶ Μενάνδρου ὧδέ πως κωμῳδοῦντος· οἴκοι

μένειν χρὴ καὶ μένειν ἐλεύθερον, ἢ μηκέτ' εἶναι τὸν καλῶς εὐδαίμονα. 

Menander, too, on comedy, saying: "He ought at home to stay, and free remain, Or be no longer rightly happy."

6.2.8.1 Πάλιν

Θεόγνιδος μὲν λέγοντος· οὐκ ἔστι<ν> φεύγοντι φίλος καὶ πιστὸς ἑταῖρος, 

Again, Theognis having said: "The exile has no comrade dear and true,"

6.2.8.2 

Εὐριπίδης πεποίηκεν· πένητα φεύγοντα φεύγει πᾶς τις ἐκποδὼν φίλος. 

Euripides has written: "Far from the poor flies every friend."

6.2.8.3 

Ἐπιχάρμου τε εἰπόντος· ὦ θύγατερ, αἰαῖ τύχας· συνοικεῖς ὦν νέῳ γ' ἔσσα παλαιτέρα, 

καὶ ἐπάγοντος· ὃ μὲν γὰρ ἄλλην δῆτα λαμβάνει νεάνιδα, <ἃ δ'> ἄλλον δ' ἄλλῃ

<δῆτα> μαστεύει τινά, 

And Epicharmus, saying: "Daughter, woe worth the day Thee who art old I marry to a youth;" and adding: "For the young husband takes some other girl, And for another husband longs the wife,"

6.2.8.4 Εὐριπίδης γράφει· κακὸν γυναῖκα πρὸς νέον ζεῦξαι

νέαν· † ὃ μὲν γὰρ ἄλλης λέκτρον ἱμείρει λαβεῖν, ἣ δ' ἐνδεὴς τοῦδ' οὖσα βουλεύει

κακά. 

Euripides writes: "'Tis bad to yoke an old wife to a youth; For he desires to share another's bed, And she, by him deserted, mischief plots."

6.2.8.5 Ἔτι Εὐριπίδου μὲν ἐν τῇ Μηδείᾳ εἰπόντος· κακοῦ γὰρ ἀνδρὸς δῶρα

ὄνησιν οὐκ ἔχει, 6.2.8.6 Σοφοκλῆς ἐν τῷ Αἴαντι τῷ μαστιγοφόρῳ ἐκεῖνό φησι τὸ

ἰαμβεῖον· ἐχθρῶν δ' ἄδωρα δῶρα καὶ οὐκ ὀνήσιμα. 

Euripides having, besides, said in the Medea: "For no good do a bad man's gifts,"Sophocles in Ajax Flagellifer utters this iambic: "For foes' gifts are no gifts, nor any boon."

6.2.8.7 Σόλωνος δὲ ποιήσαντος·

τίκτει γὰρ κόρος ὕβριν, ὅταν πολὺς ὄλβος ἕπηται, 

Solon having written: "For surfeit insolence begets, When store of wealth attends."

6.2.8.8 ἄντικρυς ὁ Θέογνις γράφει·

τίκτει τοι κόρος ὕβριν, ὅταν κακῷ ὄλβος ἕπηται. 

Theognis writes in the same way: "For surfeit insolence begets, When store of wealth attends the bad."

6.2.8.9 ὅθεν καὶ ὁ Θουκυδίδης ἐν

ταῖς ἱστορίαις εἰώθασιν δὲ οἱ πολλοὶ τῶν ἀνθρώπων φησίν, οἷς ἂν μάλιστα καὶ δι' 

ἐλαχίστου ἀπροσδόκητος 6.2.8.10 εὐπραγία ἔλθῃ, εἰς ὕβριν τρέπεσθαι. καὶ Φίλιστος

ὁμοίως τὰ αὐτὰ μιμεῖται ὧδε λέγων· τὰ δὲ πολλὰ κατὰ λόγον τοῖς ἀνθρώποις

εὐτυχοῦντα ἀσφαλέστερα <ἢ> παρὰ δόξαν· καὶ κακοπραγίαν **· εἰώθασι γὰρ μάλιστα

οἱ παρὰ δόξαν ἀπροσδοκήτως εὖ πράσσοντες εἰς ὕβριν τρέπεσθαι.

Pherecydes 7.2

6.2.9.1 Πάλιν

Εὐριπίδου ποιήσαντος· ἐκ γὰρ πατρὸς καὶ μητρὸς ἐκπονουμένων σκληρὰς διαίτας οἱ

γόνοι βελτίονες, 

Whence also Thucydides, in the Histories, says: -- "Many men, to whom in a great degree, and in a short time, unlookedfor prosperity comes, are wont to turn to insolence." And Philistus likewise imitates the same sentiment, expressing himself thus: -- "And the many things which turn out prosperously to men, in accordance with reason, have an incredibly dangerous s tendency to misfortune. For those who meet with unlooked success beyond their expectations, are for the most part wont to turn to insolence." Again, Euripides having written: "For children sprung of parents who have led A hard and toilsome life, superior are;"

6.2.9.2 Κριτίας γράφει· ἄρχομαι δέ τοι ἀπὸ γενετῆς ἀνθρώπου· πῶς

ἂν βέλτιστος τὸ σῶμα γένοιτο καὶ ἰσχυρότατος; εἰ ὁ φυτεύων γυμνάζοιτο καὶ ἐσθίοι

ἐρρωμένως. καὶ ταλαιπωροίη τὸ σῶμα καὶ ἡ μήτηρ τοῦ παιδίου τοῦ μέλλοντος

ἔσεσθαι ἰσχύοι τὸ σῶμα καὶ γυμνάζοιτο. 

Critias writes: "For I begin with a man's origin: how far the best and strongest in body will he be, if his father exercises himself, and eats in a hardy way, anti subjects his body to toilsome labour; and if the mother of the future child be strong in body, and give herself exercise."

Αὖθίς τε Ὁμήρου ἐπὶ τῆς ἡφαιστοτεύκτου ἀσπίδος εἰπόντος· 6.2.9.3 ἐν μὲν γαῖαν

ἔτευξ', ἐν δ' οὐρανόν, ἐν δὲ θάλασσαν· ἐν δ' ἐτίθει ποταμοῖο μέγα σθένος Ὠκεανοῖο, 

Again, Homer having said of the Hephaestusmade shield: "Upon it earth and heaven and sea he made, And Ocean's rivers' mighty strength portrayed,"

6.2.9.4 Φερεκύδης ὁ Σύριος λέγει· Ζᾶς ποιεῖ φᾶρος μέγα τε καὶ καλὸν καὶ ἐν αὐτῷ

ποικίλλει γῆν καὶ Ὠγηνὸν καὶ τὰ Ὠγηνοῦ δώματα. 

Pherecydes of Syros says: -- "Zas makes a cloak large and beautiful, and works on it earth and Ogenus, and the palace of Ogenus."

6.2.9.5 Ὁμήρου τε εἰπόντος·

αἰδώς, ἥτ' ἄνδρας μέγα σίνεται ἠδ' ὀνίνησιν, 

And Homer having said: "Shame, which greatly hurts a man or he!ps,"

6.2.9.6 Εὐριπίδης ἐν Ἐρεχθεῖ γράφει·

αἰδοῦς δὲ <κ>αὐτὸς δυσκρίτως ἔχω πέρι· καὶ δεῖ γὰρ αὐτῆς κἄστιν αὖ κακὸν μέγα. 

Euripides writes in Erechtheus: "Of shame I find it hard to judge; ' Tis needed.' 'Tis at times a great mischief."

6.2.10.1 Λάβοις δ' ἂν ἐκ παραλλήλου τῆς κλοπῆς τὰ χωρία κἀκ τῶν 6.2.10.2 

συνακμασάντων καὶ ἀνταγωνισαμένων σφίσι τὰ τοιαῦτα, Εὐριπίδου μὲν ἐκ τοῦ

Ὀρέστου· ὦ φίλον ὕπνου θέλγητρον, ἐπίκουρον νόσου, 

Take, by way of parallel, such plagiarisms as the following, from those who flourished together, and were rivals of each other. From the Orestes of Euripides: "Dear charm of sleep, aid in disease."

6.2.10.3 Σοφοκλέους <δ'> ἐκ

τῆς Ἐριφύλης· ἄπελθε· κινεῖς ὕπνον ἰητρὸν νόσου, 

From the Eriphyle of Sophocies: "Hie thee to sleep, healer of that disease."

6.2.10.4 καὶ Εὐριπίδου μὲν ἐξ

Ἀντιγόνης· ὀνόματι μεμπτὸν τὸ νόθον, ἡ φύσις δ' ἴση, 

And from the Antigone of Sophocles: "Bastardy is opprobrious in name; but the nature is equal;"

6.2.10.5 Σοφοκλέους δὲ ἐξ

Ἀλεαδῶν· ἅπαν τὸ χρηστὸν τὴν ἴσην ἔχει φύσιν, 

And from the Aleuades of Sophocles: "Each good thing has its nature equal."

6.2.10.6 πάλιν Εὐριπίδου μὲν ἐκ

Τημένου· τῷ γὰρ πονοῦντι καὶ θεὸς συλλαμβάνει, 

Again, in the Otimenus of Euripides: "For him who toils, God helps;"

6.2.10.7 Σοφοκλέους δὲ ἐν Μίνῳ·

οὐκ ἔστι τοῖς μὴ δρῶσι σύμμαχος τύχη, 

And in the Minos of Sophocles; "To those who act not, fortune is no ally;"

6.2.10.8 ναὶ μὴν Εὐριπίδου μὲν ἐξ

Ἀλεξάνδρου· χρόνος δὲ δείξει <σ'>· ᾧ τεκμηρίῳ μαθὼν ἢ χρηστὸν ὄντα γνώσομαί σε

ἤ<τοι> κακόν, 

And from the Alexander of Euripides: "But time will show; and learning, by that test, I shall know whether thou art good or bad;"

6.2.10.9 Σοφοκλέους δὲ ἐξ Ἱππόνου· πρὸς ταῦτα κρύπτε μηδέν, ὡς ὁ

πάνθ' ὁρῶν καὶ πάντ' ἀκούων πάντ' ἀναπτύσσει χρόνος. 

And from the Hipponos of Sophocles: "Besides, conceal thou nought; since Time, That sees all, hears all, all things will unfold."

6.2.11.1 Ἀλλὰ κἀκεῖνα

ὁμοίως ἐπιδράμωμεν. Εὐμήλου γὰρ ποιήσαντος· Μνημοσύνης καὶ Ζηνὸς Ὀλυμπίου

ἐννέα κοῦραι, 

But let us similarly run over the following; for Eumelus having composed the line, "Of Memory and Olympian Zeus the daughters nine,"

6.2.11.2 Σόλων τῆς ἐλεγείας ὧδε ἄρχεται· Μνημοσύνης καὶ Ζηνὸς

Ὀλυμπίου ἀγλαὰ τέκνα. 

Solon thus begins the elegy: "Of Memory and Olympian Zeus the children bright."

6.2.11.3 Πάλιν αὖ τὸ Ὁμηρικὸν παραφράζων Εὐριπίδης· τίς

πόθεν εἶς ἀνδρῶν; πόθι τοι πτόλις ἠδὲ τοκῆες; 6.2.11.4 τοῖσδε χρῆται τοῖς ἰαμβείοις

ἐν τῷ Αἰγεῖ· ποίαν σε φῶμεν γαῖαν ἐκλελοιπότα πόλει ξενοῦσθαι τῇδε; τίς πάτρας θ' 

ὅρος; τίς ἔσθ' ὁ φύσας; τοῦ κεκήρυξαι πατρός; 

Again, Euripides, paraphrasing the Homeric line: "What, whence art thou? Thy city and thy parents, where?" employs the following iambics in Aegeus: "What country shall we say that thou hast left To roam in exile, what thy land -- the bound Of thine own native soil? Who thee begat?

And of what father dost thou call thyself the son?"

6.2.11.5 Τί δ'; οὐ Θεόγνιδος εἰπόντος·

οἶνος πινόμενος πουλὺς κακός· ἢν δέ τις αὐτῷ χρῆται ἐπισταμένως, οὐ κακὸν ἀλλ' 

ἀγαθόν, 6.2.11.6 Πανύασ<σ>ις γράφει· ὡς οἶνος θνητοῖσι θεῶν πάρα δῶρον ἄριστον, 

πινόμενος κατὰ μέτρον, ὑπέρμετρος δὲ χερείων. 

And what? Theognis having said: "Wine largely drunk is bad; but if one use It with discretion, 'tis not bad, but good,"- does not Panyasis write?

"Above the gods' best gift to men ranks wine, In measure drunk; but in excess the worst."

6.2.12.1 Ἀλλὰ καὶ Ἡσιόδου λέγοντος· σοὶ δ' ἐγὼ ἀντὶ πυρὸς δώσω κακόν, ᾧ κεν ἅπαντες τέρπωνται, 

Hesiod, too, saying: "But for the fire to thee I'll give a plague,

6.2.12.2 

Εὐριπίδης ποιεῖ· ἀντὶ πυρὸς δὲ γὰρ ἄλλο πῦρ μεῖζον καὶ δυσμαχώτερον βλάστον

γυναῖκες. 

For all men to delight themselves withal,"- Euripides writes: "And for the fire Another fire greater and unconquerable, Sprung up in the shape of women"

6.2.12.3 Πρὸς τούτοις Ὁμήρου λέγοντος· γαστέρα δ' οὔ πως ἔστιν

ἀποπλῆσαι μεμαυῖαν, οὐλομένην, ἣ πολλὰ κάκ' ἀνθρώποισι δίδωσιν, 

And in addition, Homer, saying: "There is no satiating the greedy paunch, Baneful, which many plagues has caused to men."

6.2.12.4

Εὐριπίδης ποιεῖ· νικᾷ δὲ χρεία μ' ἡ κακῶς τε ὀλουμένη γαστήρ, ἀφ' ἧς δὴ πάντα

γίνεται κακά. 

Euripides says : "Dire need and baneful paunch me overcome; From which all evils come."

6.2.12.5 Ἔτι Καλλίᾳ τῷ κωμικῷ γράφοντι· μετὰ μαινομένων φασὶ<ν> 

χρῆναι μαίνεσθαι πάντας ὁμοίως, 6.2.12.6 Μένανδρος ἐν Πωλουμένοις παρισάζεται

λέγων· οὐ πανταχοῦ τὸ φρόνιμον ἁρμόττει παρόν· καὶ συμμανῆναι δ' ἔνια δεῖ. 

Besides, Callias the comic poet having written: "With madmen, all men must be mad, they say,"- Menander, in the Poloumenoi, expresses himself similarly, saying: "The presence of wisdom is not always suitable:

One sometimes must with others play the fool."

6.2.12.7 Ἀντιμάχου τε τοῦ Τηίου εἰπόντος· ἐκ γὰρ δώρων πολλὰ κάκ' ἀνθρώποισι

πέλονται, 6.2.12.8 Ἀγίας ἐποίησεν· δῶρα γὰρ ἀνθρώπων νοῦν ἤπαφεν ἠδὲ καὶ ἔργα. 

And Antimachus of Teos having said: "From gifts, to mortals many ills arise,"- Augias composed the line: "For gifts men's mind and acts deceive."

6.2.13.1 Ἡσιόδου δὲ εἰπόντος· οὐ μὲν γάρ τι γυναικὸς ἀνὴρ ληίζετ' ἄμεινον τῆς

ἀγαθῆς· τῆς δ' αὖτε κακῆς οὐ ῥίγιον ἄλλο, 6.2.13.2 Σιμωνίδης εἶπεν· γυναικὸς δ' 

οὐδὲν χρῆμα ἀνὴρ ληίζεται ἐσθλῆς ἄμεινον οὐδὲ ῥίγιον κακῆς. 

And Hesiod having said: "Than a good wife, no man a better thing Ere gained; than a bad wife, a worse,"- Simonides said: "A better prize than a good wife no man Ere gained, than a bad one nought worse."

6.2.13.3 Πάλιν

Ἐπιχάρμου εἰπόντος· ὡς πολὺν ζήσων χρόνον χὠς ὀλίγον οὕτως διανοοῦ, 6.2.13.4 

Εὐριπίδης γράφει· τί δήποτε ὄλβῳ μὲν μὴ σαφεῖ βεβηκότες οὐ ζῶμεν ὡς ἥδιστα μὴ

λυπούμενοι; 

Again, Epicharmas having said : "As destined Ion to live, and yet not long, Think of thyself."- Euripides writes: "Why? seeing the wealth we have uncertain is, Why don't we live as free from care, as pleasant As we may?"

6.2.13.5 Ὁμοίως τοῦ κωμικοῦ ∆ιφίλου εἰπόντος· εὐμετάβολός ἐστιν

ἀνθρώπων βίος, 6.2.13.6 Ποσείδιππος· οὐδεὶς ἄλυπος τὸν βίον διήγαγεν ἄνθρωπος

ὢν οὐδὲ μέχρι τοῦ τέλους πάλιν ἔμεινεν ἀτυχῶν. 

Similarly also, the comic poet Diphilus having said: "The life of men is prone to change,"- Posidippus says: "No man of mortal mould his life has passed From suffering free. Nor to the end again Has continued prosperous."

6.2.13.7 καὶ κατάλληλά σοί φησιν ὁ

Πλάτων γράφων περὶ ἀνθρώπου <ὡς> εὐμεταβόλου ζῴου. 6.2.13.8 Αὖθις Εὐριπίδου

εἰπόντος· ὦ πολύμοχθος βιοτὴ θνητοῖς, ὡς ἐπὶ παντὶ σφαλερὰ κεῖσαι, καὶ τὰ μὲν

αὔξεις, τὰ δὲ ἀποφθινύθεις, 

Similarly speaks to thee Plato, writing of man as a creature subject to change. Again, Euripides having said: "Oh life to mortal men of trouble full, How slippery in everything art thou I

Now grow'st thou, and thou now decay'st away.

καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ὅρος κείμενος οὐδεὶς εἰς ὅντινα χρὴ

τελέσαι θνητοῖς, πλὴν ὅταν ἔλθῃ κρυερὰ ∆ιόθεν θανάτου πεμφθεῖσα τελευτή, 

6.2.13.9 ∆ίφιλος γράφει· οὐκ ἔστι βίος ὃς οὐ<χὶ> κέκτηται κακά, λύπας, μερίμνας, 

ἁρπαγάς, στρέβλας, νόσους. τούτων ὁ θάνατος καθάπερ ἰατρὸς φανεὶς ἀνέπαυσεν

τοὺς ἔχοντας ἀναπαύσας ὕπνῳ. 

And there is set no limit, no, not one, For mortals of their course to make an end, Except when Death's remorseless final end Comes, sent from Zeus,"- Diphilus writes: "There is no life which has not its own ills, Pains, cares, thefts, and anxieties, disease; And Death, as a physician, coming, gives Rest to their victims in his quiet sleep."

6.2.14.1 Ἔτι τοῦ Εὐριπίδου εἰπόντος· πολλαὶ μορφαὶ

τῶν δαιμονίων, πολλὰ δ' ἀέλπτως κραίνουσι θεοί, 6.2.14.2 ὁ τραγικὸς ὁμοίως

Θεοδέκτης γράφει· τὸ μὴ βεβαίους τὰς βροτῶν εἶναι τύχας. 

Furthermore, Euripides having said: "Many are fortune's shapes, And many things contrary to expectation the gods perform,"- The tragic poet Theodectes similarly writes: "The instability of mortals' fates."

6.2.14.3 Βακχυλίδου τε

εἰρηκότος· παύροισι δὲ θνητῶν τὸν ἅπαντα χρόνον δαίμων ἔδωκεν πράσσοντα<ς> ἐν

καιρῷ πολιοκρόταφον γῆρας ἱκνεῖσθαι, πρὶν ἐγκῦρσαι δύᾳ, 6.2.14.4 Μοσχίων ὁ

κωμικὸς γράφει· κεῖνος δ' ἁπάντων ἐστὶ μακαριώτατος, ὃς διὰ τέλους ζῶν ὁμαλὸν

ἤσκησε<ν> βίον. 

And Bacchylides having said : "To few alone of mortals is it given To reach hoary age, being prosperous all the while, And not meet with calamities,"- Moschion, the comic poet, writes: "But he of all men is most blest, Who leads throughout an equal life."

6.2.14.5 Εὕροις δ' ἂν καὶ Θεόγνιδος εἰπόντος· οὔτοι χρήσιμόν ἐστι

νέα γυνὴ ἀνδρὶ γέροντι· οὐ γὰρ πηδαλίῳ πείθεται ὡς ἄκατος, 6.2.14.6 Ἀριστοφάνη

τὸν κωμικὸν γράφοντα· αἰσχρὸν νέᾳ γυναικὶ πρεσβύτης ἀνήρ. 

And you will find that, Theognis having said: "For no advantage to a mall grown old A young wife is, who will not, as a ship The helm, obey,"- Aristophanes, the comic poet, writes: "An old man to a young wife suits but ill."

6.2.14.7 Ἀνακρέοντος

γὰρ ποιήσαντος· Ἔρωτα γὰρ τὸν ἁβρὸν μέλπομαι βρύοντα μίτραις πολυανθέμοις

ἀείδειν· ὅδε καὶ θεῶν δυνάστης, ὅδε καὶ βροτοὺς δαμάζει, 

For Anacreon, having written: "Luxurious love I sing, With flowery garlands graced, He is of gods the king, He mortal men subdues?- 

6.2.14.8 Εὐριπίδης γράφει·

Ἔρως γὰρ ἄνδρας οὐ μόνους ἐπέρχεται οὐδ' αὖ γυναῖκας, ἀλλὰ καὶ θεῶν ἄνω ψυχὰς

ταράσσει κἀπὶ πόντον ἔρχεται. 

Euripides writes : "For love not only men attacks, And women; but disturbs The souls of gods above, and to the sea Descends."

6.2.15.1 Ἀλλ' ἵνα μὴ ἐπὶ πλέον προΐῃ ὁ λόγος

φιλοτιμουμένων ἡμῶν τὸ εὐεπίφορον εἰς κλοπὴν τῶν Ἑλλήνων κατὰ τοὺς λόγους

τε καὶ τὰ δόγματα ἐπιδεικνύναι, φέρε ἄντικρυς μαρτυροῦντα ἡμῖν Ἱππίαν τὸν

σοφιστὴν τὸν Ἠλεῖον, ὃς <εἰς> τὸν αὐτὸν περὶ τοῦ προκειμένου μοι 6.2.15.2 

σκέμματος ἥκει λόγον, παραστησώμεθα ὧδέ πως λέγοντα· τούτων ἴσως εἴρηται τὰ

μὲν Ὀρφεῖ, τὰ δὲ Μουσαίῳ, κατὰ βραχὺ ἄλλῳ ἀλλαχοῦ, τὰ δὲ Ἡσιόδῳ, τὰ δὲ Ὁμήρῳ, 

τὰ δὲ τοῖς ἄλλοις τῶν ποιητῶν, τὰ δὲ ἐν συγγραφαῖς τὰ μὲν Ἕλλησι, τὰ δὲ

βαρβάροις· ἐγὼ δὲ ἐκ πάντων τούτων τὰ μέγιστα καὶ ὁμόφυλα συνθεὶς τοῦτον

καινὸν καὶ πολυειδῆ τὸν λόγον ποιήσομαι. 

But not to protract the discourse further, in our anxiety to show the propensity of the Greeks to plagiarism in expressions and dogmas, allow us to adduce the express testimony of Hippias, the sophist of Elea, who discourses on the point in hand, and speaks thus: "Of these things some perchance are said by Orpheus, some briefly by Musaeus; some in one place, others in other places; some by Hesiod, some by Homer, some by the rest of the poets; and some in prose compositions, some by Greeks, some by Barbarians. And I from all these, placing together the things of most importance and of kindred character, will make the present discourse new and varied."

6.2.16.1 Ὡς δὲ μὴ ἄμοιρον τήν τε

φιλοσοφίαν τήν τε ἱστορίαν, ἀλλὰ μηδὲ τὴν ῥητορικὴν τοῦ ὁμοίου ἐλέγχου

περιίδωμεν, καὶ τούτων ὀλίγα παραθέσθαι εὔλογον. 6.2.16.2 Ἀλκμαίωνος γὰρ τοῦ

Κροτωνιάτου λέγοντος ἐχθρὸν ἄνδρα 6.2.16.3 ῥᾷον φυλάξασθαι ἢ φίλον ὁ μὲν

Σοφοκλῆς ἐποίησεν ἐν τῇ Ἀντιγόνῃ· τί γὰρ γένοιτ' <ἂν> ἕλκος μεῖζον ἢ φίλος κακός;

And in order that we may see that philosophy and history, and even rhetoric, are not free of a like reproach, it is right to adduce a few instances from them. For Alcmaeon of Crotona having said, "It is easier to guard against a man who is an enemy than a friend," Sophocles wrote in the Antigone: "For what sore more grievous than a bad friend?"

6.2.16.4 Ξενοφῶν δὲ εἴρηκεν· οὐκ ἂν ἐχθροὺς ἄλλως πως βλάψειεν ἄν τις ἢ φίλος

δοκῶν εἶναι. 

And Xenophon said: "No man can injure enemies in any way other than by appearing to be a friend."

6.2.16.5 Καὶ μὴν ἐν Τηλέφῳ εἰπόντος Εὐριπίδου· Ἕλληνες ὄντες

βαρβάροις δουλεύσομεν; 

And Euripides having said in Telephus: "Shall we Greeks be slaves to Barbarians? "- 

6.2.16.6 Θρασύμαχος ἐν τῷ ὑπὲρ Λαρισαίων λέγει· Ἀρχελάῳ

δουλεύσομεν Ἕλληνες ὄντες βαρβάρῳ; 

Thrasymachus, in the oration for the Larissaeans, says: "Shall we be slaves to Archelaus -- Greeks to a Barbarian?"

6.2.17.1 Ὀρφέως δὲ ποιήσαντος· ἔστιν ὕδωρ

ψυχῇ, θάνατος δ' ὑδάτεσ<σ>ιν ἀμοιβή, ἐκ δὲ ὕδατος <μὲν> γαῖα, τὸ δ' ἐκ γαίας πάλιν

ὕδωρ· ἐκ τοῦ δὴ ψυχὴ ὅλον αἰθέρα ἀλλάσσουσα· 6.2.17.2 Ἡράκλειτος ἐκ τούτων

συνιστάμενος τοὺς λόγους ὧδέ πως γράφει· ψυχῇσιν θάνατος ὕδωρ γενέσθαι, ὕδατι

δὲ θάνατος γῆν γενέσθαι, ἐκ γῆς δὲ ὕδωρ γίνεται, ἐξ ὕδατος δὲ ψυχή. 

And Orpheus having said: "Water is the change for soul, and death for water; From water is earth, and what comes from earth is again water, And from that, soul, which changes the whole ether;" and Heraclitus, putting together the expressions from these lines, writes thus: "It is death for souls to become water, and death for water to become earth; and from earth comes water, and from water soul."

6.2.17.3 Ναὶ

μὴν Ἀθάμαντος τοῦ Πυθαγορείου εἰπόντος ὧδε ἀγέννατος παντὸς ἀρχὰ καὶ

ῥιζώματα τέσσαρα τυγχάνοντι, πῦρ, ὕδωρ, ἀήρ, γῆ· 

And Athamas the Pythagorean having said, "Thus was produced the beginning of the universe; and there are four roots -- fire, water, air, earth: for from these is the origination of what is produced," -- 

ἐκ τούτων γὰρ αἱ γενέσεις τῶν

γινομένων ὁ Ἀκραγαντῖνος 6.2.17.4 ἐποίησεν Ἐμπεδοκλῆς· τέσσαρα τῶν πάντων

ῥιζώματα πρῶτον ἄκουε· πῦρ καὶ ὕδωρ καὶ γαῖαν ἰδ' αἰθέρος ἄπλετον ὕψος· ἐκ γὰρ

τῶν ὅσα τ' ἦν ὅσα τ' ἔσσεται ὅσσα τ' ἔασιν. 

Empedocles of Agrigentum wrote : "The four roots of all things first do thou hear- Fire, water, earth, and ether's boundless height:

For of these all that was, is, shall be, comes."

6.2.17.5 Καὶ Πλάτωνος μὲν λέγοντος διὰ

τοῦτο καὶ <οἱ> θεοὶ τῶν ἀν6.2.17.5 θρωπείων ἐπιστήμονες, οὓς ἂν διὰ πλείστου

ποιῶνται, θᾶττον ἀπαλ6.2.17.6 λάττουσι τοῦ ζῆν 

And Plato having said,"Wherefore also the gods, knowing men, release sooner from life those they value most,

Μένανδρος πεποίηκεν· ὃν οἱ θεοὶ

φιλοῦσιν, ἀποθνῄσκει νέος. 

"Menander wrote: "Whom the gods love, dies young."

6.2.18.1 Εὐριπίδου δὲ ἐν μὲν τῷ Οἰνομάῳ γράφοντος·

τεκμαιρόμεσθα τοῖς παροῦσι τὰ ἀφανῆ, 6.2.18.2 ἐν δὲ τῷ Φοίνικι· τὰ ἀφανῆ

θεὸς κιβδηλότατον ποίησε βροτοῖσι, καὶ γνῶναι πάντων τοῦτ' ἀνιαρότερον, 6.2.18.7 

Εὐριπίδης μὲν γὰρ γράφει· ὦ Ζεῦ, τί δὴ χρυσοῦ μὲν ὃς κίβδηλος ἦν, τεκμήρια

ἀνθρώποισιν ὤπασας σαφῆ, ἀνδρῶν δὲ ὅτῳ χρὴ τὸν κακὸν διειδέναι, οὐδεὶς

χαρακτὴρ ἐμπέφυκε σώματι; 

And Euripides having written in the OEnomaus: "We judge of things obscure from what we see;" and in the Phoenix: "By signs the obscure is fairly grasped?- Hyperides says, "But we must investigate things unseen by learning from signs and probabilities." And Isocrates having said, "We must conjecture the future by the past," Andocides does not shrink from saying, "For we must make use of what has happened previously as signs in reference to what is to be." Besides, Theognis having said : "The evil of counterfeit silver and gold is not intoler able, O Cyrnus, and to a wise man is not difficult of detection; But if the mind of a friend is hidden in his breast, If he is false, and has a treacherous heart within, This is the basest thing for mortals, caused by God, And of all things the hardest to detect,"- Euripides writes : "Oh Zeus, why hast thou given to men clear tests Of spurious gold, while on the body grows No mark sufficing to discover clear The wicked man?"

6.2.18.8 Ὑπερείδης δὲ καὶ αὐτὸς λέγει· χαρακτὴρ οὐδεὶς

ἔπεστιν ἐπὶ τοῦ προσώπου τῆς διανοίας τοῖς ἀνθρώποις. 

Hyperides himself also says, "There is no feature of the mind impressed on the countenance Of men."

6.2.19.1 Πάλιν Στασίνου

ποιήσαντος· νήπιος ὃς πατέρα κτείνων παῖδας καταλείπει, 6.2.19.2 Ξενοφῶν λέγει·

ὁμοίως γάρ μοι νῦν φαίνομαι πεποιηκέναι, ὡς εἴ τις πατέρα ἀποκτείνας τῶν παίδων

αὐτοῦ φείσαιτο. 6.2.19.3 Σοφοκλέους τε ἐν Ἀντιγόνῃ ποιήσαντος· μητρός τε ἐν

Ἅιδου καὶ πατρὸς τετευχότων, οὐκ ἔστ' ἀδελφὸς ὅστις ἂν βλάστοι ποτέ, 6.2.19.4 

Ἡρόδοτος λέγει· μητρὸς καὶ πατρὸς οὐκ ἔτ' ὄντων, ἀδελφὸν ἄλλον οὐχ ἕξω. 6.2.19.5 

Πρὸς τούτοις Θεοπόμπου ποιήσαντος· δὶς παῖδες οἱ γέροντες ὀρθῷ τῷ λόγῳ, 

Again, Stasinus having composed the line: "Fool, who, having slain the father, leaves the children,"- Xenophon says, "For I seem to myself to have acted in like manner, as if one who killed the father should spare his children." And Sophocles having written in the Antigone: "Mother and father being in Hades now, No brother ever can to me spring forth?- Herodotus says, "Mother and father being no more, I shall not have another brother." In addition to these, Theopompus having written: "Twice children are old men in very truth;"

6.2.19.6 

καὶ πρό γε τούτου Σοφοκλέους ἐν τῷ Πηλεῖ· Πηλέα τὸν Αἰάκειον οἰκουρὸς μόνη

γερονταγωγῶ καὶ ἀναπαιδεύω <πάλιν>· πάλιν γὰρ αὖθις παῖς ὁ γηράσκων ἀνήρ, 

6.2.19.7 Ἀντιφῶν ὁ ῥήτωρ λέγει· γηροτροφία γὰρ προσέοικεν παιδοτροφίᾳ, 6.2.19.8 

ἀλλὰ καὶ ὁ φιλόσοφος Πλάτων· ἄρ', ὡς ἔοικεν, ὁ γέρων δὶς παῖς γένοιτ' ἄν. 6.2.20.1

παραπέμψομαι· Κρατίνου ἐν Πυτίνῃ εἰπόντος· τὴν μὲν παρασκευὴν ἴσως γινώσκετε, 

And before him Sophocles in Peleus: "Peleus, the son of Aeacus, I, sole housekeeper, Guide, old as he is now, and train again, For the aged man is once again a child,"- Antipho the orator says, "For the nursing of the old is like the nursing of children." Also the philosopher Plato says, "The old man then, as seems, will be twice a child." Further, Thucydides having said, "We alone bore the brunt at Marathon," -- Demosthenes said, "By those who bore the brunt at Marathon." Nor will I omit the following. Cratinus having said in the "The preparation perchance you know,"

6.2.20.4 Ἀνδοκίδης ὁ ῥήτωρ λέγει· τὴν μὲν παρασκευήν, ὦ ἄνδρες δικασταί, καὶ τὴν

προθυμίαν τῶν ἐχθρῶν τῶν ἐμῶν σχεδόν τι πάντες εἴσεσθε. 6.2.20.5 ὁμοίως καὶ

Αἰσχίνης λέγει· τὴν μὲν παρασκευὴν ὁρᾶτε, ὦ ἄνδρες Ἀθηναῖοι, καὶ τὴν παράταξιν. 

6.2.20.7 Πάλιν ∆ημοσθένους εἰπόντος ὅση μέν, ὦ ἄνδρες Ἀθηναῖοι, σπουδὴ περὶ

Ἰσοκράτους πάλιν εἰρηκότος ὥσπερ τῶν χρημάτων, ἀλλ' οὐκ 6.2.21.2 ἐκείνου

συγγενὴς οὖσα Λυσίας ἐν τοῖς Ὀρφανικοῖς λέγει· καὶ φανερὸς γέγονεν οὐ τῶν

σωμάτων συγγενὴς ὤν, ἀλλὰ τῶν χρημάτων. 6.2.21.3 Ἐπεὶ καὶ Ὁμήρου ποιήσαντος·

ὦ πέπον, εἰ μὲν γὰρ πόλεμον περὶ τόνδε φυγόντες αἰεὶ δὴ μέλλοιμεν ἀγήρω τ' 

ἀθανάτω τε ἔσσεσθ', οὔτε κεν αὐτὸς ἐνὶ πρώτοισι μαχοίμην οὔτε κε σὲ στέλλοιμι

μάχην ἐς κυδιάνειραν· νῦν δ', ἔμπης γὰρ κῆρες ἐφεστᾶσι<ν> θανάτοιο μυρίαι, ἃς οὐκ

ἔστι φυγεῖν βροτὸν οὐδ' ὑπαλύξαι, ἴομεν, εἴ κέ τῳ εὖχος ὀρέξομεν, ἠέ τις ἡμῖν, 

Andocides the orator says, "The preparation, gentlemen of the jury, and the eagerness of our enemies, almost all of you know." Similarly also Nicias, in the speech on the deposit, against Ly-sias, says, "The preparation and the eagerness of the adversaries, ye see, O gentlemen of the jury." After him Aeschines says, "You see the preparation, O men of Athens, and the line of battle." Again, Demosthenes having said, "What zeal and what canvassing, O men of Athens, have been employed in this contest, I think almost all of you are aware;" and Philinus similarly, "What zeal, what forming of the line of battle, gentlemen of the jury, have taken place in this contest, I think not one of you is ignorant." Isocrates, again, having said, "As if she were related to his wealth, not him," Lysias says in the Orphics, "And he was plainly related not to the persons, but to the money." Since Homer also having written: "O friend, if in this war, by taking flight, We should from age and death exemption win, I would not fight among the first myself, Nor would I send thee to the glorious fray; But now -- for myriad fates of death attend In any case, which man may not escape Or shun -- come on. To some one we shall bring Renown, or some one shall to us,"

6.2.21.4 Θεόπομπος γράφει· εἰ μὲν γὰρ ἦν τὸν κίνδυνον τὸν παρόντα διαφυγόντας

ἀδεῶς διάγειν τὸν ἐπίλοιπον χρόνον, οὐκ ἂν ἦν θαυμαστὸν φιλοψυχεῖν, νῦν δὲ

τοσαῦται κῆρες τῷ βίῳ παραπεφύκασιν ὥστε τὸν ἐν ταῖς μάχαις θάνατον

αἱρετώτερον εἶναι δοκεῖν. 6.2.21.5 Τί δ'; οὐχὶ καὶ Χίλωνος τοῦ σοφιστοῦ

ἀποφθεγξαμένου ἐγγύα, 6.2.21.6 πάρα δ' ἄτα Ἐπίχαρμος τὴν αὐτὴν γνώμην ἑτέρῳ

ὀνόματι προηνέγκατο εἰπών· ἐγγύας ἄτα <'στι> θυγάτηρ, ἐγγύα δὲ ζαμίας. 6.2.22.1 

Ἀλλὰ καὶ τοῦ ἰατροῦ Ἱπποκράτους ἐπιβλέπειν οὖν δεῖ καὶ ὥρην 6.2.22.2 καὶ χώρην

καὶ ἡλικίην καὶ νόσους 

Theopompus writes, "For if, by avoiding the present danger, we were to pass the rest of our time in security, to show love of life would not be wonderful.

But now, so many fatalities are incident to life, that death in battle seems preferable." And what? Child the sophist having uttered the apophthegm, "Become surety, and mischief is at hand," did not Epicharmus utter the same sentiment in other terms, when he said, "Suretyship is the daughter of mischief, and loss that of suretyship?" Further, Hippocrates the physician having written, "You must look to time, and locality, and age, and disease,"

γράφοντος Εὐριπίδης ἐν ἑξαμέτρῳ τινὶ ῥήσει φησίν· ὃς οἶδ' 

ἰατρεύειν καλῶς, πρὸς τὰς διαίτας τῶν ἐνοικούντων πόλιν τὴν γῆν <τ'> ἰδόντα τὰς

νόσους σκοπεῖν χρεών. 

Euripides says in Hexameters : - "Those who the healing art would practise well, Must study people's modes of life, and note The soil, and the diseases so consider."

6.2.22.3 Ὁμήρου πάλιν ποιήσαντος· μοῖραν δ' οὔ τινά φημι

πεφυγμένον ἔμμεναι ἀνδρῶν. 6.2.22.4 ὅ τε Ἀρχῖνος λέγει· πᾶσι μὲν ἀνθρώποις

ὀφείλεται ἀποθανεῖν ἢ 6.2.22.5 πρότερον ἢ εἰς ὕστερον, ὅ τε ∆ημοσθένης· πᾶσι μὲν

γὰρ ἀνθρώποις τέλος τοῦ βίου θάνατος, κἂν ἐν οἰκίσκῳ τις αὑτὸν καθείρξας τηρῇ. 

Homer again, having written: "I say no mortal man can doom escape,"- Archinus says, "All men are bound to die either sooner or later;" and Demosthenes, "To all men death is the end of life, though one should keep himself shut up in a coop."

6.2.23.1 Ἡροδότου τε αὖ ἐν τῷ περὶ Γλαύκου τοῦ Σπαρτιάτου λόγῳ φήσαντος τὴν

Πυθίαν εἰπεῖν τὸ πειρηθῆναι τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ τὸ ποιῆσαι 6.2.23.2 ἴσον γενέσθαι, 

Ἀριστοφάνης ἔφη· δύναται γὰρ ἴσον τῷ δρᾶν τὸ νοεῖν, 

And Herodotus, again, having said, in his discourse about Glaucus the Spartan, that the Pythian said, "In the case of the Deity, to say and to do are equivalent," Aristophanes said : "For to think and to do are equivalent."

6.2.23.3 καὶ πρὸ τούτου ὁ

Ἐλεάτης Παρμενίδης· τὸ γὰρ αὐτὸ νοεῖν ἐστί<ν> τε καὶ εἶναι. 

And before him, Parmenides of Elea said: "For thinking and being are the same."

6.2.23.4 Ἢ οὐχὶ καὶ

Πλάτωνος εἰπόντος ἡμεῖς δὲ τοῦτο λέξοιμεν ἂν ἴσως οὐκ ἀτόπως, ὅτι ἀρχὴ μὲν

ἔρωτος ὅρασις, μειοῖ δὲ τὸ πάθος ἐλπίς, 6.2.23.5 τρέφει δὲ μνήμη, τηρεῖ δὲ συνήθεια, 

Φιλήμων ὁ κωμικὸς γράφει· ὁρῶσι πάντες πρῶτον, εἶτ' ἐθαύμασαν, ἔπειτ' 

ἐπεθεώρησαν, εἶτ' ἐς ἐλπίδα. ἐνέπεσοι· οὕτω γίνεται ἐκ τούτων ἔρως. 

And Plato having said, "And we shall show, not absurdly perhaps, that the beginning of love is sight; and hope diminishes the passion, memory nourishes it, and intercourse preserves it;" does not Philemon the comic poet write : "First all see, then admire; Then gaze, then come to hope; And thus arises love?"

6.2.23.6 Ἀλλὰ

καὶ ∆ημοσθένους εἰπόντος πᾶσι γὰρ ἡμῖν ὁ θάνατος ὀφεί6.2.23.7 λεται καὶ τὰ ἑξῆς, ὁ

ἔστιν ἐκφυγέειν, ὁπόσοι γῆν ἐπιφερβόμεθα. 

Further, Demosthenes having said, "For to all of us death is a debt," and so forth, Phanocles writes in Loves, or The Beautiful: "But from the Fates' unbroken thread escape Is none for those that feed on earth."

6.2.24.1 Εὕροις δ' ἂν καὶ Πλάτωνος

εἰπόντος παντὸς γὰρ φυτοῦ ἡ πρώτη βλάστη, καλῶς ὁρμηθεῖσα πρὸς ἀρετήν, τῆς

παραλλάξωσιν τὴν νεωτέραν ἡλικίαν. 6.2.24.3 Κἀκεῖνο τὸ Ἐμπεδοκλέους· ἤδη γάρ

ποτ' ἐγὼ γενόμην κοῦρός τε κόρη τε θάμνος τ' οἰωνός τε καὶ εἰν ἁλὶ ἔλλοπος ἰχθύς, 

6.2.24.4 Εὐριπίδης ἐν Χρυσίππῳ μεταγράφει· θνῄσκει δὲ οὐδὲν τῶν γινομένων, 

διακρινόμενον δ' ἄλλο πρὸς ἄλλο μορφὴν ἑτέραν ἐπέδειξεν. 

You will also find that Plato having said, "For the first sprout of each plant, having got a fair start, according to the virtue of its own nature, is most powerful in inducing the appropriate end;" the historian writes, "Further, it is not natural for one of the wild plants to become cultivated, after they have passed the earlier period of growth;" and the following of Empedo cles: "For I already have been boy and girl, And bush, and bird, and mute fish in the sea,"- Euripides transcribes in Chrysippus: "But nothing dies Of things that are; but being dissolved, One from the other, Shows another form."

6.2.24.56 Πλάτωνός τε

ἐν Πολιτείᾳ εἰπόντος κοινὰς εἶναι τὰς γυναῖκας Εὐριπίδης ἐν Πρωτεσιλάῳ γράφει·

κοινὸν γὰρ εἶναι χρῆν γυναικεῖον λέχος. 

And Plato having said, in the Republic, that women were common, Euripides writes in the Protesilaus: "For common, then, is woman's bed."

6.2.24.7 Ἀλλ' Εὐριπίδου γράφοντος· ἐπεὶ τά

γ' ἀρκοῦντα ἱκανὰ τοῖς γε σώφροσιν, 6.2.24.8 Ἐπίκουρος ἄντικρύς φησι·

πλουσιώτατον αὐτάρκεια πάντων. 

Further, Euripides having written : "For to the temperate enough sufficient is "- Epicurus expressly says, "Sufficiency is the greatest riches of all."

6.2.24.9 Αὖθίς τε Ἀριστοφάνους γράφοντος·

βέβαιον ἕξεις τὸν βίον δίκαιος ὤν, χωρίς τε θορύβου καὶ φόβου ζήσεις καλῶς, 

6.2.24.10 ὁ Ἐπίκουρος λέγει· δικαιοσύνης καρπὸς μέγιστος ἀταραξία. 

Again, Aristophanes having written : "Life thou securely shalt enjoy, being just And free from turmoil, and from fear live well,"- Epicurus says, "The greatest fruit of righteousness is tranquillity."

6.2.25.1 Αἱ μὲν

οὖν ἰδέαι τῆς κατὰ διάνοιαν Ἑλληνικῆς κλοπῆς εἰς ὑπόδειγμα ἐναργὲς τῷ διορᾶν

δυναμένῳ τοιαίδε οὖσαι ἅλις ἔστωσαν. 

Let these species, then, of Greek plagiarism of sentiments, being such, stand as sufficient for a clear specimen to him who is capable of perceiving.

ἤδη δὲ οὐ τὰς διανοίας μόνον καὶ λέξεις

ὑφελόμενοι καὶ παραφράσαντες ἐφωράθησαν, ὡς ἐδείχθη, ἀλλὰ γὰρ καὶ τὰ φώρια ἄντι6.2.25.2 κρυς ὁλόκληρα ἔχοντες διελεγχθήσονται· αὐτοτελῶς γὰρ τὰ ἑτέρων

Σαμίου τὴν Οἰχαλίας ἅλωσιν. 

And not only have they been detected pirating and paraphrasing thoughts and expressions, as will be shown; but they will also be convicted of the possession of what is entirely stolen. For stealing entirely what is the production of others they have published it as their own; as Eugamon of Cyrene did the entire book on the Thesprotians from Musaeus, and Pisander of Camirus the Heraclea of Pisinus of Lindus, and Panyasis of Halicarnassus, the capture of OEchalia from Cleophilus of Samos.

6.2.26.1 Εὕροις δ' ἂν καὶ Ὅμηρον τὸν μέγαν ποιητὴν

ἐκεῖνα τὰ ἔπη· οἷον δὲ τρέφει ἔρνος ἀνὴρ ἐριθηλὲς ἐλαίης καὶ τὰ ἑξῆς κατὰ λέξιν

μετενηνοχότα παρ' Ὀρφέως ἐκ τοῦ ∆ιονύσου ἀφανισμοῦ. 

You will also find that Homer, the great poet, took from Orpheus, from the Disappearance of Dionysus, those words and what follows verbatim: "As a man trains a luxuriant shoot of olive."

6.2.26.2 Ἔν τε τῇ Θεογονίᾳ

ἐπὶ τοῦ Κρόνου Ὀρφεῖ πεποίηται· κεῖτ' ἀποδοχμώσας παχὺν αὐχένα, κὰδ δέ μιν

And in the Theogony, it is said by Orpheus of Kronos: "He lay, his thick neck bent aside; and him All-conquering Sleep had seized."

ταῦτα δὲ Ὅμηρος ἐπὶ τοῦ Κύκλωπος μετέθηκεν. 6.2.26.3 

Ἡσίοδός τε ἐπὶ τοῦ Μελάμποδος ποιεῖ· ἡδὺ δὲ καὶ τὸ πυθέσθαι, ὅσα θνητοῖσιν

ἔδειμαν ἀθάνατοι, δειλῶν τε καὶ ἐσθλῶν τέκμαρ ἐναργές, καὶ τὰ ἑξῆς παρὰ

Μουσαίου λαβὼν τοῦ ποιητοῦ κατὰ λέξιν. 

These Homer transferrred to the Cyclops. And Hesiod writes of Melampous: "Gladly to hear, what the immortals have assigned To men, the brave from cowards clearly marks;" and so forth, taking it word for word from the poet Musaeus.

6.2.26.4 Ἀριστοφάνης δὲ ὁ κωμικὸς ἐν ταῖς

πρώταις Θεσμοφοριαζούσαις 6.2.26.5 τὰ ἐκ τῶν Κρατίνου Ἐμπιπραμένων

μετήνεγκεν ἔπη. Πλάτων δὲ ὁ κωμικὸς καὶ Ἀριστοφάνης ἐν τῷ ∆αιδάλῳ τὰ ἀλλήλων

ὑφαιροῦνται. 6.2.26.6 τὸν μέντοι Κώκαλον τὸν ποιηθέντα Ἀραρότι τῷ Ἀριστοφάνους

υἱεῖ 6.2.26.7 Φιλήμων ὁ κωμικὸς ὑπαλλάξας ἐν Ὑποβολιμαίῳ ἐκωμῴδησεν. 

And Aristophanes the comic poet has, in the first of the Thesmophoriazusoe, transferred the words from the Empiprameni of Cratinus. And Plato the comic poet, and Aristophanes in Doeda-lus, steal from one another. Cocalus, composed by Araros, the son of Aristophanes, was by the comic poet Philemon altered, and made into the comedy called Hypobolimoens.

τὰ δὲ

Ἡσιόδου μετήλλαξαν εἰς πεζὸν λόγον καὶ ὡς ἴδια ἐξήνεγκαν Εὔμηλός 6.2.26.8 τε καὶ

Ἀκουσίλαος οἱ ἱστοριογράφοι. Μελησαγόρου γὰρ ἔκλεψεν Γοργίας ὁ Λεοντῖνος καὶ

Εὔδημος ὁ Νάξιος οἱ ἱστορικοὶ καὶ ἐπὶ τούτοις ὁ Προκοννήσιος Βίων, ὃς καὶ τὰ

Κάδμου τοῦ παλαιοῦ μετέγραψεν κεφαλαιούμενος, Ἀμφίλοχός τε καὶ Ἀριστοκλῆς

καὶ Λεάνδριος καὶ Ἀναξιμένης καὶ Ἑλλάνικος καὶ Ἑκαταῖος καὶ Ἀνδροτίων και

Φιλόχορος ∆ιευχίδας τε ὁ Μεγαρικὸς τὴν ἀρχὴν τοῦ λόγου ἐκ τῆς 6.2.27.1 

Ἑλλανίκου ∆ευκαλιωνείας μετέβαλεν. σιωπῶ δὲ Ἡράκλειτον τὸν 6.2.27.2 Ἐφέσιον, 

ὃς παρ' Ὀρφέως τὰ πλεῖστα εἴληφεν. 

Eumelus and Acusilaus the historiographers changed the contents of Hesiod into prose, and published them as their own. Gorgias of Leontium and Eudemus of Naxus, the historians, stole from Melesagoras. And, besides, there is Bion of Proconnesus, who epitomized and transcribed the writings of the ancient Cadmus, and Archilochus, and Aristotle, and Leandrus, and Hellanicus, and Hecataeus, and Androtion, and Philochorus. Dieuchidas of Megara transferred the beginning of his treatise from the Deucalion of Hellanicus. I pass over in silence Heraclitus of Ephesus, who took a very great deal from Orpheus.

παρὰ Πυθαγόρου δὲ καὶ τὴν ψυχὴν ἀθάνατον

εἶναι Πλάτων ἔσπακεν, ὃ δὲ παρ' Αἰγυ6.2.27.3 πτίων. πολλοί τε τῶν ἀπὸ Πλάτωνος

συγγραφὰς πεποίηνται, καθ' ἃς ἀποδεικνύουσι τούς τε Στωϊκούς, ὡς ἐν ἀρχῇ

εἰρήκαμεν, τόν τε Ἀριστοτέλη τὰ πλεῖστα καὶ κυριώτατα τῶν δογμάτων παρὰ

6.2.27.5 Ταυτὶ μὲν οὖν ταύτῃ· ἐπιλείψει γάρ με

ἣν παρ' ἡμῶν εἰλήφασιν. 

From Pythagoras Plato derived the immortality of the soul; and he from the Egyptians. And many of the Platonists composed books, in which they show that the Stoics, as we said in the beginning, and Aristotle, took the most and principal of their dogmas from Plato. Epicurus also pilfered his leading dogmas from Democritus. Let these things then be so. For life would fail me, were I to undertake to go over the subject in detail, to expose the selfish plagiarism of the Greeks, and how they claim the discovery of the best of their doctrines, which they have received from us.

Pherecydes 7.2

Now also Valentinus, the Coryphaeus of those who herald community, in his book on The Intercourse of Friends, writes in these words: 

[4] "πολλὰ τῶν γεγραμμένων ἐν ταῖς δημοσίαις βίβλοις εὑρίσκεται γεγραμμένα ἐν τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ τοῦ θεοῦ· τὰ γὰρ κοινὰ ταῦτα ἔστι τὰ ἀπὸ καρδίας ῥήματα, νόμος ὁ γραπτὸς ἐν καρδίᾳ· οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ λαὸς ὁ [6.6.53] [1] τοῦ ἠγαπημένου, ὁ φιλούμενος καὶ φιλῶν αὐτόν." 

"Many of the things that are written, though in common hooks, are found written in the church of God. For those sayings which proceed from the heart are vain. For the law written in the heart is the People of the Beloved -- loved and loving Him." 

δημοσίας γὰρ βίβλους εἴτε τὰς Ἰουδαϊκὰς λέγει γραφὰς εἴτε τὰς τῶν φιλοσόφων, κοινοποιεῖ τὴν ἀλήθειαν.

For whether it be the Jewish writings or those of the philosophers that he calls "the Common Books," he makes the truth common. 

[2]    Ἰσίδωρός τε ὁ Βασιλείδου υἱὸς ἅμα καὶ μαθητὴς ἐν τῷ πρώτῳ τῶν τοῦ προφήτου Παρχὼρ Ἐξηγητικῶν καὶ αὐτὸς κατὰ λέξιν γράφει· 

And Isidore," at once son and disciple to Basilides, in the first hook of the Expositions of the Prophet Parchor, writes also in these words: 

"The Attics say that certain things were intimated to Socrates, in consequence of a daemon attending on him. And Aristotle says that all men are provided with daemons, that attend on them during the time they are in the body,-having taken this piece of prophetic instruction and transferred it to his own books, without acknowledging whence he had abstracted this statement." 

[3] "φασὶ δὲ οἱ Ἀττικοὶ μεμηνῦσθαί τινα Σωκράτει παρεπομένου δαίμονος αὐτῷ, καὶ Ἀριστοτέλης δαίμοσι κεχρῆσθαι πάντας ἀνθρώπους λέγει συνομαρτοῦσιν αὐτοῖς παρὰ τὸν χρόνον τῆς ἐνσωματώσεως, προφητικὸν τοῦτο μάθημα λαβὼν καὶ καταθέμενος εἰς τὰ ἑαυτοῦ [4] βιβλία, μὴ ὁμολογήσας ὅθεν ὑφείλετο τὸν λόγον τοῦτον." 

καὶ πάλιν ἐν τῷ δευτέρῳ τῆς αὐτῆς συντάξεως ὧδέ πως γράφει· 

And again, in the second book of his work, he thus writes: 

"καὶ μή τις οἰέσθω, ὅ φαμεν ἴδιον εἶναι τῶν ἐκλεκτῶν, τοῦτο προειρημένον ὑπάρχειν ὑπό τινων φιλοσόφων· οὐ γάρ ἐστιν αὐτῶν εὕρεμα, τῶν δὲ προφητῶν σφετερισάμενοι προσέθηκαν τῷ [μὴ] ὑπάρχοντι κατ' αὐτοὺς [5] σοφῷ." 

"And let no one think that what we say is peculiar to the elect, was said before by any philosophers. For it is not a discovery of theirs. For having appropriated it from our prophets, they attributed it to him who is wise according to them." 

αὖθίς τε ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ· 

Again, in the same: 

"καὶ γάρ μοι δοκεῖ τοὺς προσποιουμένους φιλοσοφεῖν, ἵνα μάθωσι τί ἐστιν ἡ ὑπόπτερος δρῦς καὶ τὸ ἐπ' αὐτῇ πεποικιλμένον φᾶρος, πάντα ὅσα Φερεκύδης ἀλληγορήσας ἐθεολόγησεν, λαβὼν ἀπὸ τῆς τοῦ Χὰμ προφητείας τὴν ὑπόθεσιν·

"For to me it appears that those who profess to philosophize, do so that they may learn what is the winged oak,'" and the variegated robe on it, all of which Pherecydes has employed as theological allegories, having taken them from the prophecy of Chum.
