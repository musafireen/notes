The Egg, Phanes, and the Titans.

aiunt ergo qui sapientiores sunt inter gentiles, primo omnium Chaos fuisse: 

“The wise men, then, who are among the Gentiles, say that first of all things was chaos; 

hoc per multum tempus exteriores sui solidans partes, fines sibi et fundum quendam fecisse, tanquam in ovi immanis modum formamque collectum, intra quod multo nihilominus tempore, quasi intra oni testam, fotum vivificatumque esse animal quoddam; 

that this, through a long time solidifying its outer parts, made bounds to itself and a sort of foundation, being gathered, as it were, into the manner and form of a huge egg, within which, in the course of a long time, as within the shell of the egg, there was cherished and vivified a certain animal; 

disruptoque post haec immani illo globo processisse speciem quandam hominis duplicis formae, quam illi masculofeminam vocant; 

and that afterwards, that huge globe being broken, there came forth a certain kind of man of double sex, which they call masculo-feminine. 

hunc etiam Phaneta[m] nominarunt, ab apparendo, quia cum appa | ruisset, inquiunt, tunc etiam lux effulsit. 

This they called Phanetas, from appearing, because when it appeared, they say, then also light shone forth. 

et ex hoc dicunt progenitam esse substantiam, prudentiam, motum, coitum: ex his factum Coelum et Terram. 

And from this, they say that there were produced substance, prudence, motion, and coition, and from these the heavens and the earth were made. 

ex Coelo sex progenitos mares, quos et Titanas vocitarunt, et sunt nomina eorum quidem qui ex Coelo orti sunt, haec: 

From the heaven they say that six males were produced, whom they call Titans; and in like manner, from the earth six females, whom they called Titanides. 

And these are the names of the males who sprang from the heaven: 

Oceanus, Coeus, Crios, Hyperion, Iapetos, Cronos, qui apud nos Saturnus nominatur. 

Oceanus, Cœus, Crios, Hyperion, Iapetus, Cronos, who amongst us is called Saturn. 

similiter et earum quae e Terra ortae sunt nomina sunt haec: 

In like manner, the names of the females who sprang from the earth are these: 

Theia, Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne, Tethys, Phoebe.

Theia, Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne, Tethys, Phoebe.”

The Titans marry and Kronos devours his children.

ex his omnibus qui primus fuerat e Coelo natus, primam Terrae filiam accepit uxorem, secundus secundam et caeteri similiter per ordinem. 

“Of all these, the first-born of the heaven took to wife the first-born of earth; the second the second, and in like manner all the rest. 

primus ergo qui primam duxerat, propter eam deductus est deorsum; 

The first male, therefore, who had married the first female, was on her account drawn downwards; 

secunda vero propter eum cui nupserat, ascendit sursum; 

but the second female rose upwards, by reason of him to whom she was married; 

et ita singuli per ordinem facientes, manserunt in his qui eis nuptiali sorte obuenerant locis (Cf. J. Kroll Lehren d. Herm Trismeg. 237.) ex istorum coniunctionibus alios quoque innumeros asserunt progenitos. 

and so each doing in their order, remained in those places which fell to their share by the nuptial lot. From their intercourse they assert that innumerable others sprang. 

sed de illis sex maribus unus, qui dicitur Saturnus, in coniugium accepit Rheam, et cum responso quodam commonitus esset, quod qui ex ea naceretur for | tior ipso futurus esset regnoque eum depelleret, omnes qui ei nascerentur filios devorare instituit. 

But of these six (Titanic) males, the one who is called Saturn (Κρόνος) received in marriage Rhea, and having been warned by a certain oracle that he who should be born of her should be more powerful than himself, and should drive him from his kingdom, he determined to devour all the sons that should be born to him. 

huic ergo primus nascitur filius, quem Aiden appellarunt, qui apud nos Orcus nominatur, quem pro causis quibus supra diximus assumptum devorat pater. 

First, then, there is born to him a son called Aides, who amongst us is called Orcus (Ὅρκος); and him, for the reason we have just stated, he took and devoured. 

post hunc secundum genuit, quem Neptunum dicunt, quemque simili modo devoravit. 

After him he begot a second son, called Neptune; and him he devoured in like manner. 

novissimum genuit eum, quem Iovem appellant, sed hunc mater miserans Rhea, per artem devoraturo subtrahit patri, 

Last of all, he begot him whom they call Jupiter; but him his mother Rhea pitying, by stratagem withdrew from his father when he was about to devour him. 

et primo quidem ne vagitus pueri innotesceret, Corybandtas quosdam cymbala fecit ac tympana percutere, ut obstrepente sonitu vagitus non audiretur infantis.

And first, indeed, that the crying of the child might not be noticed, she made certain Corybantes strike cymbals and drums, that by the deafening sound the crying of the infant might not be heard.”

Kronos swallows the stone, and the Three Zefs assume their rulerships.

Sed cum ex uteri imminutione intellexisset pater editum partum, expetebat ad devorandum; 

"But when he understood from the lessening of her belly that her child was born, he demanded it, that he might devour it; 

tune Rhea lapidem ei offerens magnum ‘hunc genui’ inquit. 

then Rhea presented him with a large stone, and told him that that was what she had brought forth. 

at ille accipiens absorbuit, et lapis devoratus eos quos primo absorbuerat filios, trusit et coëgit exire. 

And he took it, and swallowed it; and the stone, when it was devoured, pushed and drove forth those sons whom he had formerly swallowed. 

primus ergo procedens descendit Orcus, et inferiora, hoc est inferna, occupat loca. 

Therefore Orcus (Hades, ᾍδης), coming forth first, descended, and occupies the lower, that is, the infernal regions. 

secundus utpote illo superior super aquas detruditur, is quem Neptunum vocant. 

The second, being above him...he whom they call Neptune (Ποσειδῶν), is thrust forth upon the waters. 

tertius qui arte matris Rheae superfuit, ab ipsa caprae superpositus in coelum emissus est.

The third (Ζεὺς), who survived by the artifice of his mother Rhea, she put upon a she-goat and sent into heaven.”

Conclusion.

Hactenus anilis gentilium fabula et genealogia processerit; sine fine enim est, si velim omnes generationes eorum quos deos appellant, et impia gesta proferre.

“But enough of the old wife’s fables and genealogy of the Gentiles; for it were endless if I should set forth all the generations of those whom they call Gods, and their wicked doings."
