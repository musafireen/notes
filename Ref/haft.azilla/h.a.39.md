الباب التاسع والثلاثون في معرفة قتل الحسين في الباطن قال المفضل: سألت مولانا الصادق علينا سلامه عن قوله تعالى: « وَفَدَيْنَاهُ بِذِبْحِ 

عَظِيمٍ». قال الصادق : إن الحسن كان في زمن إبراهيم كان إسحاق والحسين كان إسماعيل. 

:قلت يا مولاي، أخبرني بقصة المسيح. 

من 

:قال هل ترى المسيح أفضل عند الله من جميع النبيين والمرسلين والأوصياء الطاهرين، ولكن الله إذا أراد أن يظهر أمراً، أظهر بعضه ليستدل بذلك الظاهر على باطنه، ويستدل في البعض على الكل، لكي لا يستكبرون قدرة الله عز وجل، ولا تنقطع عظمة الله عن أنبيائه وأوصيائه وأصفيائه، وكان الحسين بن علي أكرم على اله من أن يذيقه الحديد على أيدي الكفرة، وحاشا أن يذيقه حر الحديد، وين عند الله لطف التدبير ما يتلطف باوليائه، وينقذهم من أهل عداوته، ويهلك أعداءه واعداء أوليائه بالحجة البالغة، وإنه عز وجل عادل لا يجوز، وحليم لا يميل، ولقد فعل الله سبحانه بالحسين فعلة لم يفعلها بالمسيح ولا بزكريا ولا بيحيى ولا بأحد من الأنبياء، وإن الذبح في الظاهر كان إلى إسماعيل الذي فدي بذبح عظيم، هو الحسين الذي هو عينه واسمه ونسبه وليس بينهما فرق كأنهما واحد، ولقد ذبح في الظاهر أكثر من ألف مرة على ما يتوهمون أهل الكفر ، وإنما الحسين مثله كمثل المسيح ، وقوله تعالى: «وَقَوْلِهِمْ إِنَّا قَتَلْنَا الْمَسِيحَ عِيسَى ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ وَمَا قَتَلُوهُ وَمَا صَلَبُوهُ وَلَكِنْ شُبِّهَ لَهُمْ وَإِنَّ الَّذِينَ اخْتَلَفُوا فِيهِ لَفِي شَكٍّ مِنْهُ مَا لَهُمْ بِهِ مِنْ عِلْمٍ إِلَّا اتِّبَاعَ الظَّنِّ وَمَا قَتَلُوهُ يَقِينًا * بَلْ رَفَعَهُ اللَّهِ إِلَيْهِ». 

فهذه الصفة صفة قتل الأنبياء والأوصياء والأولياء والله يفعل ما يشاء. 

اللهم العن الجبت والطاغوت

ثم قال الصادق : ما تقول أهل الكوفة في هذه الآية، يا مفضل: «إِنِّي أَرَى فِي الْمَنَامِ أنّى أَذْبَحُكَ فَانْظُرْ مَاذَا تَرَى قَالَ يَا أَبَتِ افْعَلْ مَا تُؤْمَرُ سَتَجِدُنِي إِنْ شَاءَ اللَّهِ مِنَ الصَّابِرِينَ فَلَمّا أَسْلَمَا وَتَلَّهُ لِلْجَبِينِ * وَنَادَيْنَاهُ أَنْ يَا إِبْرَاهِيمُ * قَدْ صَدَقْتَ الرَؤْيَا إِنَّا كَذَلِكَ نَجْزِي 

الْمُحْسِنِينَ إِنْ هَذَا لَهُوَ الْبَلَاءُ الْمُبِينُ - وَفَدَيْنَاهُ بِذِبْحٍ عَظِيمٍ»، 

*

قال المفضل هل تريد يا مولاي قول شيعتك أم قول غيرها؟ قال: أريد ما تقوله غير شيعتي. فقلت: يقولون أن الذي فدى إسماعيل بذبح عظيم هو كبش أملح خرج من الجنة. قال الصادق : سبحان الله إن الله لم يخلق للجنة شيئا يعنيه بالقتل. إن هذا أيضا من كفرهم يزعمون أن اله أخرج من الجنة كيشا فذبحه بلا جرم ولا ذنب، والله تعالى 

عادل لا يجور. یا مفضل : أخبرني عن المفدي والمفدى، أيهما أعظم قدرة؟ 

قلت: كيف؟ 

قال: وفديناه بذبح عظيم وجعل الأمر العظيم للمفدي. 

قلت: سيدي، هذا شيء لا أعلمه إلا تعلمني به؟ 

قال الصادق : ويحك يا مفضل لو علم الناس أمر ذلك الذبح العظيم لطال تعجبهم وولهت عقولهم و ازداد کفرهم وعدوانهم على الله ورسوله ، ولكن طمس على أعينهم وختم على قلوبهم وحرمهم معرفة سره ومكنونه. 

یا مفضل، إن الكبش الذي فدي به الحسين كان الألم، ألم قريش، وهو يومئذ شيخ في تركيب كبش. 

اما رايت با مفضل قرنيه في البيت الحرام معلقين؟ 

قلت نعم يا مولاي 

۲۰۶ 

اللهم عجل لوليک الفرج 

قال: فذاك القرنان لذلك الكبش الذي فدى به الحسين ، ثم ضحك الصادق حتى 

بدت نواجذه. 

:قلت يا مولاي ما الذي أضحكك؟ 

قال: یا مفضل: إن الناس إذا اجتمعوا بالموسم بمكة المكرمة رغبوا أن ينظروا إلى قرني الكبش تعجبا لأنه من الجنة ونحن نقوم بالنظر إليهما تعجباً، إنهما قرنا دلامة. فالناس يتعجبون من شيء ونحن فتعجب من شيء خلافه. 

ثم قال: يا مفضل، ما تقول شيعتي في ذلك؟ قلت يا مولاي يروي عن جابر عن الباقر في قوله: «وفديناه بذبح عظيم» أن إسحق هو الحسن والحسين لها هو إسماعيل. 

قال الصادق صدقوا بما قالوه فالحسين أعظم خطرا عند الله من أن يذبح، ولكن الناس لا يعلمون منزلة أولياء الله تعالي وشيعتنا يسمعون الباطن منا من علم الله وعلم وصیه و علم رسوله محمد ، فيؤتونه إلى إخوانهم المؤمنين، ولا يقبلون من غيرهم الباطل، وهو اعظم عند الله، ويبطلون الحق ويحقون الباطل، والله أعلم بلطفه وتدبيره لا يسال عما يفعل وهم يسالون: « يَضْرِبُ اللهِ الْأَمْثَالَ لِلنَّاسِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَذَكَّرُونَ». وقال: «انْظُرْ كَيْفَ نُبَيْنُ لَهُمُ الآيَاتِ ثُمَّ انْظُرْ أَنَّى يُؤْفَكُونَ». وقال تعالى في موضع آخر: «لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ» . فضرب سبحانه وتعالى أمثالا في كتابه للناس وما يعقلها إلا العالمون. 

قال المفضل يا مولاي والله أشفيتني وأذهبت علي كل هم وغم. 

قال الصادق : إن الله تعالى شفاء لما في الصدور وهدى ورحمة للمؤمنين، والباطن 

هو شفاء الصدور. 

قلت الحمد لله على ذلك. 

اللهم العن الجبت والطاغوت

فقال: یا مفضل هذا سبب ذبح الكبش ألم أخبرك بتفصيل اليوم الذين اجتمعوا على 

قتل الحسين السلام. 

قلت: نعم

**"In Knowing the Killing of Hussein in the Esoteric/Inner"**

Mufaddal said: "I want to ask you about the verse:

_**"But we saved him from a great slaughter. And We left for him among generations (to**_

_**come) in later times"**_

(The Holy Qur'an 37:107-108)

The Imam responded: “In the time of Abraham...

"Imam Al Hassan used to be Prophet Isaac

And Imam Al Hussein used to be Prophet Ismael.”

Mufaddal said "O Master, tell me about the story of the Messiah."

The Imam said "Do you see the Messiah better with Allah than all the Prophets and Messengers and Purified Vicegerents? If Allah wants to show a matter, he shows part of it so that the Inner/Esoteric may be inferred from the Apparent. And He implies in some for all (meaning Allah pointed out Jesus' escape from the cross as an indication that Sent from Allah and Chosen by Him, they too were not killed by their enemies and it is only in the Apparent made to look so and what is implied about one prophet is true about all).

So they are not Scornful concerning the Ability of Allah and so the Greatness of Allah is not cut off from His Prophets and Vicegerents and Purified Ones. And Hussein son of Ali was dearer to Allah than to make him taste the pain of the Iron at the hands of the Disbelievers.

And He was far from letting him taste the pain of the Iron and Verily Allah has Plans of Kindness for His Preferred Ones and He saves them from His Enemies.

And He destroys His enemies and the enemies of His Preferred Ones with the Extreme proof and Verily Allah is Just and does not oppress, and is Tolerant and does not stray.

And Allah did something with Hussein that He did not do with the Messiah nor Zachariyah nor John (Yahya) nor anyone of the Prophets.

The Slaughter in the Apparent was for Ismael who was ransomed with a Great Slaughter, he is Hussein who is him exactly and his name and lineage. And there is no Difference between them, it is as if they are one and he was slaughtered in the Apparent more than 1,000 times as imagined by the people of disbelief, but Hussein's example is like that of the Messiah. And Allah's words:

_**"Make sure! And their saying: 'We killed Christ Jesus the son of Mary,**_

_**the Apostle of Allah", but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but so it was made**_

_**to appear to them. And those who differ therein are full of doubts with no (certain)**_

_**knowledge, but only conjecture to follow; for sure they killed him not.**_

_**Nay, Allah raised him up unto Himself."**_

(The Holy Qur'an 4:157-158)

That description is the description of the killing of the Prophets and Vicegerents and Preferred of Allah, and Allah does what He wills. What do the people of Kufa say about this verse O Mufaddal?

- 61 -

_**“I see in my sleep that I offer thee in sacrifice: Now see what is thy view!"**_

_**He said: 'O my father! Do as thou art commanded: thou will find me, if Allah so wills**_

_**one practicing Patience and Constancy!"**_

_**So when they had both submitted their wills (to Allah), and he had laid him prostrate**_

_**on his forehead (For sacrifice).**_

_**We called out to him 'O Abraham! Thou hast already fulfilled the vision!" - thus indeed**_

_**do We reward those who do right.**_

_**For this was obviously a trial.**_

_**And We ransomed him with a momentous sacrifice."**_

(The Holy Qur'an 37:102-107)

Mufaddal said "Do you want what your Shia say or other than your Shia?"

The Imam replied "I want what other than my Shia say."

Mufaddal said "They say that what was ransomed for slaughter in exchange for Ismael was a sheep from Paradise"

Imam Al Sadiq said "SubhanAllah, verily Allah did not create anything for Paradise which He then tortures by Killing. That is also from their Disbelief, claiming that Allah brought a Sheep out of Paradise and slaughtered it with no Crime nor Sin and Allah is Just. O Mufaddal tell me about the Ransomed and Ransomed, which is Greater in Position?"

Mufaddal asked "How?"

The Imam said "And We ransomed him with a Great Slaughter' and He made the Great matter for the Ransomed"

Mufaddal said "That is something I do not know, will you teach me about it?"

The Imam said "Woe to you O Mufaddal, if the people knew the matter of that Slaughter they would be in wonderment for a long time and their minds (would spin) and their disbelief would increase and their enmity against Allah and His Prophet. But Allah stamped over their eyes and sealed their hearts and forbade them from knowing His secret and its contents.

O Mufaddal the Sheep that Hussein was ransomed with was the Idol, the Idol of Quraysh and he was in those days an old man in the incarnation of a Sheep. Have you not seen O

Mufaddal his two horns hanging at the Holy House (Kaaba)?"

Mufaddal said "Yes Master"

The Imam said "So those horns belong to that Sheep that Hussein was ransomed with" then the Imam laughed until his gums showed.

Mufaddal said "O Master, what makes you laugh?"

The Imam said "The people if they gather in the season in Mecca the Blessed, theywant to look at the horns of the Sheep in wonderment because it is from paradiseand we look at them in wonderment because they are the horns of an idol. So the people wonder at one thing and we wonder at another.O Mufaddal, what does my Shia say about that?"

Mufaddal said "O Master, Jabbir narrates from Imam Al Baqir about Allah's words _**'And we**_

_**ransomed him with a great sacrifice'**_ that Isaac is Hassan and Hussein is Ismael"

The Imam said "They have spoken the truth in what they said for Hussein is Greater with Allah than to be slaughtered but people do not know the station of the Preferred of Allah. Our

- 62 -

Shia hear from us this Inner/Esoteric knowledge of Allah and His Vicegerent and Prophet Mohammed and they give it to their Believing Brothers. And they do not accept from other than them Falsehood, and he is Greater with Allah and they falsify the Truth and make the False into Truth. And Allah knows best His Gentleness and Planning, He is not asked about what He does and they are asked.

**"So Allah sets forth parables for men, in order that they may receive** **admonition/Remember."**

(The Holy Qur'an 14:25)

_**"See how Allah doth make His signs clear to them; yet see in what ways they are**_

_**deluded away from the truth?"**_

(The Holy Qur'an 5:75)

_**"That they may reflect."**_

(The Holy Qur'an 59:21)

So Allah set examples in His book for the people and none understand it except for the Knowers/Gnostics."

Mufaddal said "O Master, by Allah you have cured me and banished all grief and worries from me."

The Imam said "Verily, Allah is a cure for what is in the breasts and a Guidance and Mercy for the Believers and the Esoteric/Inner is what is the cure for the breasts.

q replied "They are the Five Veils that Night and Day and Prayer and Zakat (Charity) and the Building in Creation have been built upon"

Mufaddal asked "And what about the Piercing Stars that we see between the Sky and the Earth, Spread out and Hanging?"

Imam Al Sadiq replied "Those are the Light Bodies that were made for the Believers from their works. As such in the Sky of Bodies a Sun and Moon, seen by the ones unlike them in the manner which you see them, the Honored Light Bodies. And in every Sky of these Seven Adamites, an Adam Standing, Fixed, on the same example of what Allah created of the First creation. And they have ranks in the Skies, Sky by Sky, in accordance with their rank and Degree."

Mufaddal said "Tell me, are the Seven Skies all one or are there preferences of some over the other, and who are the inhabitants of every Sky?"

The Imam replied:

"The First Sky is the Housing of the Imams.

The Second is for the Ones who spoke.

The Third is for the Noble/Smart.

The Fourth is for the Dedicated.

The Fifth is for the Orphans.

The Sixth is for the Veils.

And the Sevenths is for the Doors.

And everything has its reason and motives in its (placement in a) home, and its specialty and how it shows in the Sky and Peace, the End"

**"In Knowing the Throne and its Corners"**

Mufaddal recited:

_**"These are the Signs/Verses of the Book of Wisdom.**_

_**Is it a matter of wonderment to men that We have sent Our inspiration to a man from**_

_**among themselves?**_

_**That he should warn mankind (of their danger) and give the good news to the**_

_**Believers that they have before their Lord the lofty rank of truth.**_

_**(But) say the Unbelievers: "This is indeed an evident sorcerer!**_

_**Verily your Lord is Allah, who created the heavens and the earth in six days,**_

_**and then was firmly established on the throne, (and his throne was on water)**_

_**regulating and governing all the things."**_

(The Holy Qur'an 10:1-3)

Imam Al Sadiq said "O Mufaddal, do you know about the Throne anything?"

Mufaddal said "No",

So the Imam said

"The Inner meaning of the Throne is Four Corners, or Four Persons.

The First Corner is Mohammed (sawas). Allah is my leader and Lord and I am the Leader of the Believers. Whoever I am the Leader of then Ali is his Leader.

The Second Corner is the Prince of the Believers.

The Third Corner is Al Hassan.

And the Fourth Corner is All Hussain.

Mufaddal asked "O Master, what is the meaning of His words _**'And His Throne was on**_

_**water?"**_

Imam Al Sadiq replied "Do you not know its interpretation?"

Mufaddal said "No."

The Imam said "The Water is the Knowledge and his saying to Ali is Knowledge. Did you not hear Allah's words?

_**"...and We send down pure water from the sky.**_

_**That with it We may give life to a dead land, and slake the thirst of things We have**_

_**created, cattle and men in great numbers.**_

_**And We have distributed the (water) amongst them, in order that they may celebrate**_

_**(our) praises, but most men are averse (to aught) but (rank) ingratitude."**_

(The Holy Qur'an 25:48-50)

And the meaning is We sent down pure Water from the Sky which is the Knowledge, Allah purified it and specialized it for His Chosen Ones and Prophets and Purified the Ones. That with it We may give life to a dead land, and We slake the thirst of Our Preferred /Chosen of Our Blessings with this Inner Knowledge. And what Blessing is Greater than this Knowledge and Peace"

**"In Knowing the Mountains and the Oceans and the Adamite Veils"**

Mufaddal asked Imam Jafar al Sadiq (as) about Allahś words:

_**"Allah is He Who created seven Skies and of the earth a similar number.**_

_**Through the midst of them Descends His Command: that ye may know that Allah has**_

_**power over all things that ye may know that Allah has power over all things, and that**_

_**Allah surrounds all things in (His) Knowledge."**_

(The Holy Qur'an 65:12)

The Imam replied "The Seven Skies, it is the Light Veils. As for the Earths, it is the Seven Adamite Veils" then he explained it to Mufaddal and said "As for the meaning of:

_**"Is it that ye deny Him Who created the earth in two Days? And do ye join equals with**_

_**Him? He is the Lord of (all) the Worlds.**_

_**He set on the (earth), mountains standing firm, high above it, and bestowed blessings**_

_**on the earth, and measured therein all things to give them nourishment in due**_

_**proportion, in four Days, in accordance with (the needs of) those who seek**_

_**(Sustenance). Moreover He Established Himself Firmly unto the sky, and it had been**_

_**(as) smoke: He said to it and to the earth: "Come ye together, willingly or unwillingly."**_

_**They said: "We do come (together), in willing obedience." So He completed them as**_

_**seven firmaments in two Days, and He assigned to each heaven its duty and**_

_**command. And We adorned the lower heaven with lights, and with guard.**_

_**Such is the Decree of (Him) the Exalted in Might, Full of Knowledge."**_

(The Holy Qur'an 41:9-12)

Take its interpretation from the Inner/Esoteric of our Knowledge that is in fact the Hidden Secret of Allah and His Safeguarded Knowledge.

Mufaddal said "O Master, Specialize for me something of this Knowledge and what is the meaning of the Lordś words "And ye join equals?"

The Imam replied "It means do you make the Veils equal and obey them as you obey Allah, Lord of the Worlds, who veiled Himself with these Veils? And made Mountains from above it?"

Mufaddal said "That (verse) is something the people have failed to interpret/explain"

"The Mountains are the Imams O Mufaddal, and if it wasn't for the Imams, you would doubt your religion and go astray and turn from the Clear Path. And they forbid you from being Fake, did you not hear Him say _**'He set on the (earth), mountains standing firm'**_ to shake ya, meaning the Earth. For the Earth is the Believers and the Mountains are the Imams as Allah has said"

**"In Knowing the Last Adam and his Age/Time"**

Imam Al Sadiq said "Verily Allah brought down the Last Adam in the End Times and Typhoons, and He created for him and his seed an Earth and Sky.

And Air and Water and a Heaven and a Hell as He created for the ones that were before, because Allah creates in every Sky a Paradise out of the good works of Adam and his seed.

And He created in every Earth a Hell from the Sins of Iblis and his seed, and the Heavens are in the Sky, and the Hell in the Earth.

And He created an Eye/Fountain in the Sky that is often called 'The Eye/Fountain of Life' and it is the resting place of the Believers.

For if a Believer dies, his Soul is carried until it rises to the Sky according to its faith.

Then it is dipped into that Eye/Fountain.

And when it (the soul) is dipped, it forgets all the Grief and Pain that passed upon it in this world.

And it wears its Light Body, then stay in Heaven with the Angels.

And he sheathes to another Light when his breath comes out.

And there comes forth Semen then his soul returned to the Semen at that exact time.

Meaning when the Breath leaves and Peace"

**"In Knowing the Believers and how they are born and where is their Destination and** **how they are returned after their Death"**

Mufaddal asked Imam Ja´far al Sadiq, Peace and Blessings be upon him about the Birth of the Believers.

The Imam replied:

“There is no Believer that dies except that his soul is carried to Imam Ali and he looks in it.

If it was a Tested Purified Believer, the Angels raise with his Soul to the Sky and dip it into the Eye at the door of Heaven, its name is the Eye/Fountain of Life.

If it leaves its Light Body and lived in Heaven with the Angels and Prophets, while the Body is being grown in his motherś belly.

And it is that in the very hour that the Soul leaves his Body, Sperm falls into the Belly of his (new) mother.

And in that Hour and in that time exactly, the Sperm grows into Congealed Blood/a Leech.

And if it becomes Congealed Blood/a Leech, the Angels take a Soul from the Souls of the Disbelievers and places it into the Congealed Blood so it is tortured.

So the Soul of the Disbeliever is punished in the Wombs, in the Blood and Menstruation and Darkness until it becomes a Body.

The Soul of the Believer is in Bliss in Paradise while the weakened Soul of the Disbeliever is tortured until it becomes an embryo.

So if it becomes an Embryo, a Soul of the Disbeliever Souls is placed in that Body in the womb, it is hung upside down weakened in the Body. And so it grows and the Soul of the Disbeliever is tortured and Hung Upside Down in Blood and Menstruation and other than that of what is in the Womb. Until the Body reaches its Appointed Time, and if it reaches its Appointed Time, the Angels gather to the Soul that is in Heaven. And they take the Covenant upon it. And the Woman is made to Release from Imprisoning the Soul. And if the (Believer) Soul is slow in its descent, the Release is slower on the Woman and her pain increases. It is then that the Soul is presented before the Lord and He takes its Covenant for Himself after the Angels took it, then the Angels descend with it and the Imam is with them. So if it finishes to the position of the Woman, the Angels rebuke it such a Rebuke that the Body flips upside down in Fear of the Rebuke of the Angels. His Bottom becomes his High and that is why he emerges Head before Feet. And if he comes out, the Angels place the Soul of that Believer into it, and that is after he is dropped (been born).

And a Sign of the Birth of the Believer is that the Body if it is dropped and the soul penetrates it, the newborn will look to the Sky. Because he is looking at the Imam and at the Angels that Descended, so his face brightens and he smiles and laughs happily for his Imam and the Angels. And he does not frown nor look gloomy in that hour, that is the Sign of the Believer and if the Imam and Angels leave him, he cries upon their leaving.

And All Praises to Allah as a Guide, and Proof and Peace, the End."

# Door # 35

**"In Knowing the Birth of the Disbeliever"**

Mufaddal asked "How is the Birth of the Disbeliever?"

Imam Jafar al Sadiq replied:

"The Birth of the Disbeliever is that when he is dropped, he looks to the Sky in fear of the Angels that brought him. His face becomes gloomy and he frowns..and he cries from that hour and remains angry, crying, frowning, screaming until the Angels leave him. It is then that his Terror calms and becomes still and his self returns to him and his crying disappears, that is the Sign of his Dropping. As for the Sign of his Birth, if his Soul leaves his Body at Death, in that exact Hour the Sperm enters into his (new) mother's Belly. And the Angels come at the time the Spirit leaves the Body and they take it until they reach the First Air of the First Earth that has the First Fire/Hell. And it is dipped into an Eye/Fountain of Hell often called the Eye of the Lowly because the Souls become lowly in that Eye/Fountain.

Then they dip him into it such a dip that he finds in that dip so much of God's Punishment that if it were put on a Mountain it would've crumbled it. And he forgets then all that was good and tasteful of the World that had passed upon him and the Soul is sent into the Fire for 40

Days. For 40 Days until the Sperm becomes congealed blood then the Angels bring him out of the torture and imprison him in the Womb. And it continues to sack blood and Menstruation and eating until the appointed time comes to it and the Angels of Torture come to it.

And if the Soul looks at the Angels of Torture, it is overtaken with terror and it thinks it will go out to Torture and back to the Eye/Fountain it was in. So it is there that the Woman falls into Release (labor) and it becomes painful on her. And the Angels are present in an image other than their image and the Imam (as) is present and Rebukes it a Final Rebuke.

And it turns the Head down in Fear and Terror from the image of the Imam. And so the newborn comes out Crying, with a Frowning Face, and (discharge) is coming out of his throat and sight. And perhaps he turns on his face and side in Terror, and he remains crying until the Imam and Angels leave from him and Peace"

**"In Knowing the Two Souls/Spirits that are trapped in the Body"**

Mufaddal said "Tell me about the Two Souls that are trapped in the Body and where does each so go?"

Imam Al Sadiq replied "One of them is called 'The Registered"

"And from it comes Sneezing, Yawning, Trembling in the Body, Pleasant Smells... and Wisdom in the Body. And that is why if someone sneezes, the people say to him "God bless you" and if he yawns, he twisted and heightened in the Body. As for the other Hung Soul, from it comes Facces and Nasty Winds, and that is because the Winds run into the Mouth and Nose. And for that reason what comes out runs from the bottom of the person and does not come out from above the head, and that is from the Soul being upside down and Peace"

**"In Knowing the Birth of the Prophets and Vicegerents and Purified and Preferred** **Ones and the Doors and the Veils"**

Mufaddal asked the Imam (as) about the Birth of the Vicegerents.

The Imam said "How unbelievable, how unbelievable, O Mufaddal, and the Wonder of all Wonder from this. If the birth of the Believer was as such, then how is the birth of the Prophets and Vicegerents!

And know that the Birth of the Vicegerents differs from the Birth of the Believers just as the Believerś Birth differs from the Disbeliever's.

Therefore the Mothers of the Vicegerents are the Depository of a Dignified Secret and Command from Allah."

Mufaddal said "Tell me O Master about the Birth of the Vicegerents"

The Imam said "The First of Wonders is that the Mothers of the Vicegerents are Males, not Females.”

Mufaddal said "O Master, Subhanallah, How could that be?"

The Imam replied "The Angels are the ones in the Image of Women."

Then the Imam read the Verses:

_**"And they make the Angels who serve The Most Merciful into Women. Did they**_

_**witness their creation? Their evidence (testimony, what they said about this matter)**_

_**will be recorded, and they will be called to account!"**_

(The Holy Qur'an 43:19)

"Do you know O Mufaddal, who is meant by this?"

Mufaddal said "No Master"

The Imam said "It means Fatimah, do you know who Fatima is O Mufaddal?"

Mufaddal said "My Master alone knows"

The Imam said "O Mufaddal, I have preferred you with your Question.”

Mufaddal said "Other than you, all praises due to Allah that blessed me in that and all Thanks for all His Blessings, and to Him is Gratitude for that and for His Guidance and for Knowing Him."

Then the Imam recited:

_**"No one can withhold the mercy which Allah opens to mankind; and whatever He**_

_**withholds - so after it, none can release it, and He is the Most Honourable, the Wise**_"

(The Holy Qur'an 35:2)

- 57 -

Mufaddal asked "What is the interpretation of this verse?"

The Imam replied "What Allah opens of this Inner/Esoteric Knowledge for the people is a Mercy and is a Special matter He specialized for them. O Mufaddal, Verily the people think that the Mothers of the Vicegerents give Birth, but did you not read the Surah:

_**"Nay! I swear by this city. And you shall be made free from obligation in this city.”**_

This Verse Literally has Two Meanings: _**"And the Begetter and that which he beget"**_ Or it could also mean: _**"And the Begetter and he did not beget."**_

_**"Verily We have created man into toil and struggle."**_

(The Holy Qur'an 90:1-4)

For this Verse has an Esoteric/ Inner Meaning, do you see that it "begetter or begat" or that it is "begetter and no born/begat?" And how can it be born when Allah has said 'did not beget?"

Mufaddal said "O Master is this Verse concerning the Vicegerents alone or does it concern the rest of humans?"

The Imam replied "It is concerning the Vicegerents Specifically."

Mufaddal said "And what about His words 'Verily, We have created man in toil?"

The Imam replied "It means the Human is the father of Preference and he is the First and every time in the Qur'an there is a mention of the Devil, he is the Second."

Then the Imam recited:

_**"And the day whent the unjust (Abu Bakr) will gnaw his hands, saying,**_

_**"Alas, if only I had chosen a way with the (Noble) Messenger (of Allah)!"**_

_**"Woe to me - Alas, if only I had not taken that one (Umar) for a friend."**_

_**"He indeed led me astray from the advice that had come to me"**_

_**...and Satan deserts man, leaving him unaided."**_

(The Holy Qur'an 25:27-29)

"He means by this that the Second was a Deserter of the Father of Preference"

And the Imam said "Verily We Have created man into toil and struggle.' means the First is in doubt and fatigue and tiredness in 3 Darknesses. The Darkness of the Belly and the Darkness of the Womb and the Darkness of Likeness and he is in these Darknesses eating Blood and Menstruation. O Mufaddal the Believer is more Honored by Allah to be fed from this anything and you think it with your mind, rather they are innocent of it.

As for the Vicegerents, they are according to what I have told you,” then he recited:

_**"Does he think that none see him?**_

_**He may say (boastfully); Wealth have I squandered in abundance!**_

_**Does he think that none have power over him?"**_

(The Holy Qur'an 90:5-7)

_**"Verily, We have power over him and We Punish him."**_

Mufaddal said "The people are destroyed!"

Imam Al Sadiq said "The people are our Shia rather the ones who are destroyed are the ones who obeyed our enemies."

Mufaddal said "The most beloved of things to me is that you finish for me the Birth of the Vicegerents."

Imam Al Sadiq said "Verily Allah built the Bodies of the Vicegerents as Thighs on the Angels until they reach the Appointed Time. That is with the Purity of the Angels as I told you, so if Allah wanted to show the Imam in the Apparent as a Discipline to this Creation. He sends a Spirit/Soul from Him and it enters the newborn that might be purified from all pollution and it did not challenge it with the womb. But the Spirit/Soul enters into him as a Discipline for the people, do you know O Mufaddal what is the Example of this?"

Mufaddal replied "No O Master"

The Imam said "The Birth of the Imam and his Death are not a Birth nor Death, rather they are the Example of a man who wears a Shirt and takes it off when he wills."

The Imam said: "That is why Allah said

_**'We talk to one who is a child in the cradle."**_

(The Holy Qur'an 19:29)

"For this reason, did you not hear what Allah said of the Cradle, when He said "And how can we talk to one who is a child in the cradle? And I am not a child, the Book came to me before you have seen me rather I entered this Body upon perplexedness and as such the Vicegerents are as such. And if they were Children, they would not understand nor comprehend and such as I have told you about a man who wore his shirt and ripped it off, and all Praises due to Allah Always and Forever and Peace."

**"In Knowing the Killing of the Imam"**

Mufaddal said to Imam Jafar al Sadiq "Tell me about the death of the Imam and his killing and how is that?"

The Imam smiled until his gums showed and then said

"You must be talking about Al Hussain and his Slaughter.

And the Killing of the Prince of the Believers

And the killing of Zachariyah

And (the killing of) 'John the Baptist' (Prophet Yahya)"

And (the killing of) Jesus"

It is accomplished.

Mufaddal said "That was in my Chest"

The Imam replied "Verily those O Mufaddal are the Purified of Allah and His Preferred Ones and His Goodness. Do you believe He would allow them to taste the Pain of the Pain of the Iron at the hands of their enemies? And it is only in the Apparent (made to seem that way) as a Confirmation of Allah's proof upon them as for them actually being killed or slaughtered.

Verily, Allah protects His Preferred Ones and Purified Ones from that and Peace"

**"In Knowing the Killing of Hussein in the Esoteric/Inner"**

Mufaddal said: "I want to ask you about the verse:

_**"But we saved him from a great slaughter. And We left for him among generations (to**_

_**come) in later times"**_

(The Holy Qur'an 37:107-108)

The Imam responded: “In the time of Abraham...

"Imam Al Hassan used to be Prophet Isaac

And Imam Al Hussein used to be Prophet Ismael.”

Mufaddal said "O Master, tell me about the story of the Messiah."

The Imam said "Do you see the Messiah better with Allah than all the Prophets and Messengers and Purified Vicegerents? If Allah wants to show a matter, he shows part of it so that the Inner/Esoteric may be inferred from the Apparent. And He implies in some for all (meaning Allah pointed out Jesus' escape from the cross as an indication that Sent from Allah and Chosen by Him, they too were not killed by their enemies and it is only in the Apparent made to look so and what is implied about one prophet is true about all).

So they are not Scornful concerning the Ability of Allah and so the Greatness of Allah is not cut off from His Prophets and Vicegerents and Purified Ones. And Hussein son of Ali was dearer to Allah than to make him taste the pain of the Iron at the hands of the Disbelievers.

And He was far from letting him taste the pain of the Iron and Verily Allah has Plans of Kindness for His Preferred Ones and He saves them from His Enemies.

And He destroys His enemies and the enemies of His Preferred Ones with the Extreme proof and Verily Allah is Just and does not oppress, and is Tolerant and does not stray.

And Allah did something with Hussein that He did not do with the Messiah nor Zachariyah nor John (Yahya) nor anyone of the Prophets.

The Slaughter in the Apparent was for Ismael who was ransomed with a Great Slaughter, he is Hussein who is him exactly and his name and lineage. And there is no Difference between them, it is as if they are one and he was slaughtered in the Apparent more than 1,000 times as imagined by the people of disbelief, but Hussein's example is like that of the Messiah. And Allah's words:

_**"Make sure! And their saying: 'We killed Christ Jesus the son of Mary,**_

_**the Apostle of Allah", but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but so it was made**_

_**to appear to them. And those who differ therein are full of doubts with no (certain)**_

_**knowledge, but only conjecture to follow; for sure they killed him not.**_

_**Nay, Allah raised him up unto Himself."**_

(The Holy Qur'an 4:157-158)

That description is the description of the killing of the Prophets and Vicegerents and Preferred of Allah, and Allah does what He wills. What do the people of Kufa say about this verse O Mufaddal?

- 61 -

_**“I see in my sleep that I offer thee in sacrifice: Now see what is thy view!"**_

_**He said: 'O my father! Do as thou art commanded: thou will find me, if Allah so wills**_

_**one practicing Patience and Constancy!"**_

_**So when they had both submitted their wills (to Allah), and he had laid him prostrate**_

_**on his forehead (For sacrifice).**_

_**We called out to him 'O Abraham! Thou hast already fulfilled the vision!" - thus indeed**_

_**do We reward those who do right.**_

_**For this was obviously a trial.**_

_**And We ransomed him with a momentous sacrifice."**_

(The Holy Qur'an 37:102-107)

Mufaddal said "Do you want what your Shia say or other than your Shia?"

The Imam replied "I want what other than my Shia say."

Mufaddal said "They say that what was ransomed for slaughter in exchange for Ismael was a sheep from Paradise"

Imam Al Sadiq said "SubhanAllah, verily Allah did not create anything for Paradise which He then tortures by Killing. That is also from their Disbelief, claiming that Allah brought a Sheep out of Paradise and slaughtered it with no Crime nor Sin and Allah is Just. O Mufaddal tell me about the Ransomed and Ransomed, which is Greater in Position?"

Mufaddal asked "How?"

The Imam said "And We ransomed him with a Great Slaughter' and He made the Great matter for the Ransomed"

Mufaddal said "That is something I do not know, will you teach me about it?"

The Imam said "Woe to you O Mufaddal, if the people knew the matter of that Slaughter they would be in wonderment for a long time and their minds (would spin) and their disbelief would increase and their enmity against Allah and His Prophet. But Allah stamped over their eyes and sealed their hearts and forbade them from knowing His secret and its contents.

O Mufaddal the Sheep that Hussein was ransomed with was the Idol, the Idol of Quraysh and he was in those days an old man in the incarnation of a Sheep. Have you not seen O

Mufaddal his two horns hanging at the Holy House (Kaaba)?"

Mufaddal said "Yes Master"

The Imam said "So those horns belong to that Sheep that Hussein was ransomed with" then the Imam laughed until his gums showed.

Mufaddal said "O Master, what makes you laugh?"

The Imam said "The people if they gather in the season in Mecca the Blessed, theywant to look at the horns of the Sheep in wonderment because it is from paradiseand we look at them in wonderment because they are the horns of an idol. So the people wonder at one thing and we wonder at another.O Mufaddal, what does my Shia say about that?"

Mufaddal said "O Master, Jabbir narrates from Imam Al Baqir about Allah's words _**'And we**_

_**ransomed him with a great sacrifice'**_ that Isaac is Hassan and Hussein is Ismael"

The Imam said "They have spoken the truth in what they said for Hussein is Greater with Allah than to be slaughtered but people do not know the station of the Preferred of Allah. Our

- 62 -

Shia hear from us this Inner/Esoteric knowledge of Allah and His Vicegerent and Prophet Mohammed and they give it to their Believing Brothers. And they do not accept from other than them Falsehood, and he is Greater with Allah and they falsify the Truth and make the False into Truth. And Allah knows best His Gentleness and Planning, He is not asked about what He does and they are asked.

**"So Allah sets forth parables for men, in order that they may receive** **admonition/Remember."**

(The Holy Qur'an 14:25)

_**"See how Allah doth make His signs clear to them; yet see in what ways they are**_

_**deluded away from the truth?"**_

(The Holy Qur'an 5:75)

_**"That they may reflect."**_

(The Holy Qur'an 59:21)

So Allah set examples in His book for the people and none understand it except for the Knowers/Gnostics."

Mufaddal said "O Master, by Allah you have cured me and banished all grief and worries from me."

The Imam said "Verily, Allah is a cure for what is in the breasts and a Guidance and Mercy for the Believers and the Esoteric/Inner is what is the cure for the breasts."

Mufaddal said "All praises and thanks to Allah for that."

The Imam said "O Mufaddal that is the reason for the slaughter of the Sheep, Did I not tell you about the details of the day they gathered on Killing Hussein?"

Mufaddal said "Yes" The End of this Door and Peace.
