الباب الاربعون في معرفة قتل الحسين على الباطن في زمن بني أميه 

قال المفضل : أخبرني يا مولاي عن قصة الحسين كيف اشتبه على الناس قتله وذبحه كما اشتبه على من كان قبلهم في قتل المسيح. قال الصادق يا مفضل هذا سر من أسرار الله أشكله على الناس فعرفوه، خاصة أولياءه و عباده المومنون المختصون من خلقه... 

إنّ الامام يدخل في الأبدان طوعاً و كرهاً و يخرج منها إذا شاء طوعاً و كرعاً كما ينزع أحدكم جبته وقميصه بلا تكلف ولا ريب فلما اجتمعوا على الحسين ليذبحوه، خرج من بدمه و رفعه الله إليه ، و منع الأعداء منه، و قد سخط سخطة جبار عنيد ولا تقوم بعظمته السموات والارض و الجبال ، إنه قادر سبحانه أن يعاجلهم العذاب، ولكنه حليم ذو بأس لا يخشى القوّة ولا خلف لوعده، و لا معقب لحكمه كما وصف سبحانه، إنه يقول ما يشاء ويظهر فى حجاب ما يشاء، و إنما يعجل من يخاف القوة، فأما الله إذا أراد أن يخلق شيئاً يقول له كن فيكون، فإنه تعالى لا يعجل العقوبة. وان الحسين لما خرج الى العراق و كان الله محتجب به صار لاينزل منزلاً صلوات الله عليه الا ويأتيه جبرئيل فيحدثه حتى اذا كان اليوم الذي اجتمعت فيه العساكر علیه و اصطفت الخيول لديه و قام الحرب ، حينئذ دعا مولانا الحسین ام جبرئیل و قال له: يا اخى من انا؟ قال: انت الله الذي لا إله الا هو الحى القيوم و المميت والمحى ، انت الذي تأمر السماء فتطیعک و الارض فتنتهى لامرک و الجبال فتجیبک و البحار فتسارع الی طاعتک و 

انت الذي لا يصل اليک کيد کائد و الاضرر ...ار 

قال الحسين : يا جبرئیل 

قال جبرئیل: لبیک یا مولای 

اللهم العن الجبت والطاغوت 

قال الحسين : أفترى هذا الخلق المنكوس تحدثهم انفسهم ان يقتلوا سيدهم لضعفهم ، ولكنهم لن يصلوا الى ذلك ، ولا الى احد من اولياء الله ، كما انهم لن يصلوا الی عیسی والی امیرالمومنین علی ، ولكنهم عملوا ذلك ليحل عليهم العذاب بعد الحجة والبيان. 

قال الحسین: یا جبرئيل انطلق الى هذا الملعون الضال الجاحد المنكوس ، وقل له: من تريد ان تحارب؟ 

قال فانطلق جبرئيل فى صورة رجل غريب مجهول ، فدخل على عمر بن سعد و هو جالس علی کرسیه بین قواده و حراسه و أبوابه ، فخرق صفوفهم حتى وصل اليه و 

وقف بين يديه. فاما نظر اليه عمر بن سعد ارتاب منه ، وارتعب وقال له: من انت؟ 

قال جبرئيل: انا عبد من عبیدالله جئت اسألک عمن تريد ان تحارب؟ قال: اريد ان الحارب الحسين بن على، و هذا كتاب عبیدالله بن زياد يأمرني فيه ان اقتل الحسين بن على و أوجه اليه رأسه و اعتزل العسكر. 

فقال له: ویحک تقتل رب العالمین و اله الاولين و الآخرين و خالق السموات و الارض و 

ما بينهما. 

فقال عمر: ويحكم، إن إبليس من أحد أعواننا، ونحن من حزبه وجنده متفقین علی قتل ابن بنت رسول الله ، فكيف يخوننا ويروعنا ؟ واما أمر هذا الرجل فقد أخلج صدري وأشغلني عن أمري، فقال رجل من القوم: أصلح الله الأمير، إنه تحقق عندي معرفة ذلك الرجل، ولا يعرفه غيري. 

قال هات ما عندك قال الرجل: أن الحسين وأباه كانا يشتغلان بشيء من السحر ولا بد قد بلغك عن 

۲۱۴ 

اللهم عجل لوليک الفرج 

علي شيء كثير من هذا الفن، وكان يزعم أن سحره دلالة. قال: صدقت وأصبت، قد بلغني عنه شيء من ذلك السحر، ولا يمكن أمرنا هذا إلا إلى السحر ، وما ذكرته إلى هذه الساعة، ولولا أن تكون قد ذكرتني من سحره لكان قد بدا إلى عند محاربته وكنت قد هممت باعتزالي ولكن اتوئي بقوسى فقد قوي قلبي وذهب علي رعبي، وأشهدكم على أنه بريء مما كان عليه علي بن أبي طالب، وما عليه ولده الحسين ، ثم رمي سهمه، وقال إلى رجاله وعسكره: إني أول من يرمي سهمه في عسكر الساحر، وأمر الناس أن يتهيأوا بسلاحهم إلى قتال ابن بنت رسول 

الله مالی 

وكان أول من طلعت طلایعه رجلان حبشيان عظيمان، وكأن عيونهما الجمر، فلما نظرهما الحسين قال: يا جبريل، أريد أن تأتيني بهذين الرجلين في تراكيبهما في المسوخية، فحينئذ مد جبريل يده فأخذهما عن ظهر فرسيهما فأحضرهما بين يدي مولانا الحسين ، فإذا هما كبشان أملحان قال: فهتف الحسين هتقة وقال: ارجعا إلى ما تعرفان به فإذا هما رجلان السودان ملعونان في دماغ كل أوحد منهما حديدة، فإذا هي تدخل في دماغ كل واحد منهما وتخرج من دبره. قال الحسين : يا أخي يا جبريل، من هذين اللعينين. 

قال: يا مولاي، هذان سعد ومعاوية. 

قال الحسين : قربا مني أيها اللعينان. 

قال: كيف رأيتما عذابي ونقمتي في مسوخيتكما؟ قال: لقد رأينا أشد العذاب. فأخرجنا من المسوخية إلى الأبدان البشرية، فقد عرفنا سبيل الحق، فارحمنا برحمة منك يا أرحم الراحمين. قال: لا رحمكما الله، هذا لكما ومردودين ألف سنة بالمسوخية في قالب بعد قالب 

اللهم العن الجبت والطاغوت 

۲۱۵ 

أشدد عليكما عذابي ونكالي جزاء بما كسبتماء. 

فقالوا: العفو، اغفر لنا فقال : لا غفران لكما ولا رحمة، فإن رحمتي وعفوي للأولياء 

والأصفياء، وإن نقمتي وباسي ونكالي لأعداء الله الظالمين. 

ثم صاح بهم صيحة فسادا في الأرض. 

قال المفضل يا مولاي إلى أين ذهبا؟ 

فقال الصادق : قد عدا إلى أصحابهما بقاتلان الحسين سلام 

قال المفضل يا مولاي هل كان مع الحصين يومئذ من المؤمنين الموحدين أحد؟ قال الصادق : كان معه مؤمن موحد وستراه معنا. 

قال وحضر أبو الخطاب، فقلت: اسمع يا أبا الخطاب ما يقول مولاي الصادق ؟ فقال أبو الخطاب: نعم كنت أنا معه. 

ثم رجع مولانا جعفر الصادق إلى حديثه فقال ابن الحسين لما أحدقوا به طلب جبريل وميكائيل وإسرافيل فأجابوه : لبيك ياربنا، فقال: اعتلوني إلى الهواء، فأعلى الحسين وغلامه جبريل، ثم تلا قوله: «لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِهِ حَتَّى يَرَوُا الْعَذَابَ الْأَلِيمَ». ثم أخذهم أخذ عزيز مقتدر. 

قال المفضل: يا مولاي أكان أصحاب الحسین میرون جبريل؟ قال الصادق : نعم ویرون میکائیل واسرافيل، وأنا أراهم وأنت تراهم. قال المفضل يا مولاي، وأنا أري جبريل وإسرافيل وميكائيل...؟ 

قال : نعم. 

قلت يا مولاي في صورة واحدة أم في صور شتى؟ 

قال : بل في صورتنا. 

قال المفضل: يا مولاي متى رأيت جبريل؟ 

قال: رأيته اليوم. 

۲۱۶ 

قال المفضل: وأين؟ 

فقال: في منزلنا هذا. 

قلت وفي أي وقت؟ 

اللهم عجل لوليک الفرج 

قال الصادق : في ساعتك هذه، أتحب أن يكلمك ؟ 

قلت: أي والله. 

قال: يا أبا الخطاب أنت جبريل؟ 

قال أبو الخطاب والله أنا جبريل ، وأنا والله الذي وجهني الحسين منه السلام إلى الملعون عمر بن سعد، وأنا الذي كلمته وأكبت وجهه في النار هو وأصحابه أجمعهم، وأنا المتولي بعذابهم بأمره، وأنا صاحب آدم الأول وأمرني فهتفت بالخلق هتقة واحدة، فقطعت منهم الأوصال وأوثقتهم بالسلاسل و الأغلال، وأنا صاحب لوح ودعوة قومه إلى عبادة الله ووحدانيته فلم يقروا ففرقتهم بالطوفان وأنا صاحب إبراهيم حين جحدوه ورموه بالنار، وأنا والله كنت معه فما أصابني إلا وإياه حر النار، وأنا صاحب دانيال والتابوت والصحف وانا والله صاحب موسی و عیسى ومحمد ، وأنا أبو الخطاب وأبو الطيبات، وأنا الذي صاح بأهل المؤتفكة صيحة فترئهم، وانا بين يدي كل إمام في كل عصر وزمان على صور مختلفة واسماء مختلفة، وأنا مع القائم بين يديه أنسف الظالمين بسيفه، وبامرني فاطيعه، وأنا أحبي و أمي وأرزق بأمر ربي. 

ثم أقبل رجلان لم أعرفهما، فقال الصادق : أتعرف هذين ؟ 

قلت: لا يا مولاي. 

قال: هذان ميكائيل وإسرافيل، أحدهما كان في المشرق والأخر كان في المغرب. قلت یا مولاي، فما كانا يصنعان؟ 

اللهم العن الجبت والطاغوت 

فقال: وجهتهما في حاجة. 

قال: هل كانا معك يا أبا الخطاب على عهد رسول الله وعلى عهد أمير المؤمنين علي السلام ؟ 

قال أبو الخطاب: نعم وعلى عهد عيسي وموسى وإبراهيم ونوح، ومن قبل كانا على عهد آدم. 

قال المفضل: جل ربي ما أعظم شأنه... فنظر إلي مولاي الصادق، وقال لي: يا مفضل، لقد أعطيت فضلا كثيرة، وعلمت علما باطنا، فعليك بكتمان سر الله ولا تطلع 

عليه إلا وليا مخلصا فإن فشيته إلى أعدائنا فقد أعنت على قتل نفسك. قلت: إنني سوف أفعل ذلك، وإنني يا مولاي رأيت العجب من كتمان هذا الخلق والبشر وكيف توصينا وتأمرنا بكتمانه... 

قال: یا مفضل، إن الله عز وجل أحب سبحانه أن يعيد سرا. 

قلت: صدقت يا مولاي وسدي والحمد لله رب العالمين

**"In Knowing the Killing of Hussein in the Inner/Esoteric in the time of Bani Ummayah"**

Mufaddal said "Tell me O Master about the story of Hussein and how his killing and slaughter was made to look so as it was made to look so for those before them with the killing of the Messiah"

Imam Al Sadiq said "O Mufaddal that is a Secret of the Secrets of Allah, He made it seem so for the people and only the special chose of His Preferred Ones and Servants who are Believers and Specialized from His creation know it.

"Verily, the Imam goes into the Bodies willingly and unwillingly and comes out of it if he wants willingly or unwillingly as one rips off his.. Shirt without trouble nor doubt. So when they gathered on Hussein to Slaughter him, he left his Body and Allah raised him unto Himself and prevented the enemies from him. And He had angered such a Powerful and Adamant Anger and neither of the Heavens and Earth and Mountains could compare in His Greatness.

He is able to make their Punishment Hurry upon them but He is Patient, with Strength and is not afraid of Power and His promise is never broken. And there are no explainers to His Wisdom as He described Himself, He says what He wills and appears in any Veil He wishes and only those who fear power rush.

Rather if Allah wanted to create something He say to it 'Be' and it is, for Allah does not rush Punishment. And when Hussein went out to Iraq and Allah took Hussein as a Veil and He went forth not stopping by a house except that Gabriel would come to him and talk. Until it was the day that soldiers gathered against him and the horses lined up and the war took place.

It was then that our Master Hussein called out to Gabriel and said to him 'My brother, who am I?"

Gabriel said 'You are Allah that there is no God but Him, the Living, the Everlasting, the One who gives Death and Life. You are the One who Commands the Sky and it obeys You and the Earth and it ends to Your Command and the Mountains, they respond to You and the Seas rush Your obedience. You are He who no Plot nor Harm reaches"

Hussein said "O Gabriel"

Al Hussein said "Do you see this backwards creation; theirselves speak to them telling them to kill their Master due to their weakness. But they will never get to that nor to anyone of the Preferred of Allah's. Just as they never reached Jesus nor the Prince of the Believers Ali. But they did that so that Torture would be incumbent upon them after the Proof and Evidence"

Then Hussein said 'O Gabriel, take off to that Cursed, Lost, Stubborn, Backwards (man) and tell him 'Who do you want to fight?"

So Gabriel took off in the image of a strange unknown man and he entered upon Umar ibn Saad while he was sitting on his chair amongst his commanders and guards and doors. He (Gabriel) infiltrated their lines until he reached him and stood between his hands, so when Umar ibn Saad looked at him, he became terrified of him.

"And he said to him "Who are you?"

"Gabriel said 'I am of the Servants of Allah, I came to ask you about who you wish to go to war with?"

- 64 -

He said 'I want to fight Hussein son of Ali and this is the book of UbaidAllah ibn Ziad commanding me in it to kill Hussein son of Ali and return his head and leave the army camp"

Gabriel replied 'Woe to you Kill the Lord of the Worlds and the God of the First and the Last and Creator of the Heavens and Earth and what is in between?"

So when Umar ibn Saad hear this he was overtaken by fear and he said to his commanders

'Take him and strike him with the poles/columns and swords. So (Gabriel) spit in their faces such a spit they they fell on their faces from it backwards and the cursed fell, Ibn Saad, off his chair backwards. So when he regained consciousness and his companions, (they found), Gabriel had gone and they saw nothing so Umar ibn Saad increased in fear and terror. And he turned to his companions and said 'Woe to you, have you ever heard of anything similar to what happened to you and did you ever see as you just saw?"

They said 'We have never seen nor heard of a man go in on a king like you who has guards and veils and soldiers and commanders". Then when I worried and worried that we shall take him and kill him, he spit in our faces such a spit that we fell (bewildered)"

So the cursed Umar ibn Saad said 'Tell me what is this and what can we do?"

So an old man who was present spoke out and said 'May Allah fix your work O Prince, do not be distraught by what you saw, perhaps it was Iblis the cursed that had manifested before us and you to scare us."

Umar said 'Woe to you! Verily Iblis is one of our helpers, and we are of his party and his soldiers, in agreement upon killing the Son of the Daughter of the Prophet of Allah, so how could he scare us and betray us? As for the matter of that man it has worried my breast and has distracted me from my matter."

So a man of the people said 'May Allah fix the Prince! I have come to know the matter of that man and no one but me knows"

He said 'Bring what you have"

The man said 'Verily Hussein and his father used to work with Magic and certainly much of this talk about Ali has already reached you. And he used to claim that his Magic was Proof."

He (Umar) said "You have spoken the Truth and are right, I did hear about that something about that magic and our matter has no explanation except for Magic. And I did not remember that until this hour and if it wasn't for you reminding me about his Magic I would've went to war and it would have seemed to me and I would've worried I should retreat. But now bring me my bow for my heart has strengthened and my fears have gone away and I shall make you witness that he is innocent of what Ali ibn Abi Talib and his son Hussein are practicing' then he threw his bow.

And he said to his men 'I shall be the first to throw his arrow in the camp of the Magician!'

and he commanded the people to prepare with their weapons to kill the Son of the Daughter of the Prophet of Allah"

And the first to go forth with their squads of soldiers were two great Ethiopian men. And it was as if their eyes were Embers so when Hussein saw them he said to Gabriel 'I want to bring Me those two men in their Maskh Incarnations. At the point Gabriel reached forth his hand and took them from the back of their horses and brought them between the hands of our Master Hussein, and there they were, (transformed as) rams.

- 65 -

Then Hussein shouted a Shout and said 'Return to what you are known by"

And there they were, two black men, cursed, in the head of each of them is a metal (pole), it goes in each of their heads and out their behind.

Hussein said 'O my brother, Gabriel, who are these two cursed ones?"

Gabriel replied 'Those two are Saad and Muawiyah"

Hussein said 'Come Nearer to Me O cursed ones! How did you find my Torture and Vengeance in your Maskh?"

He (one of them) said 'We saw the harshest of Torture, bring us out of the Maskh into the Human Bodies, we have known the way of Truth so have mercy on us O Most Merciful!"

Hussein said 'No Mercy for you from Allah, that is for yo, and reincarnations for a 1,000 years turn after turn, each time my torture more severe, in turn for what you have earned."

They said 'Forgiveness! Forgive us!"

Hussein said 'No forgiveness for you and no mercy, for My Mercy and Pardon are for the Preferred Ones and Purified Ones and my Vengeance...is for the enemies of Allah, the Oppressors"

**Every Day is Ashura part 2**

Then Hussein Yelled at them such a Yell that they melted forth in the Land."

Mufaddal said "O Master, where did they go?"

Imam Al Sadiq replied "They returned to their companions fighting Hussein."

Mufaddal asked "O Master, was there with Hussein in those times any of the Unitarian Believers?"

Imam Al Sadiq replied "He had one Unitarian with him and his disguise/screen is with us"

Abul Khattab came and Mufaddal said to him "Listen O Abul Khattab to what my Master Al Sadiq is saying."

Then Abul Khattab said "Yes I was with him"

Then Imam Al Sadiq returned to his speech and said "Verily, when they encircled Hussein he called for Gabriel and Michael and Israfel and they responded "At your command our Lord."

So he said 'Transmit me to the Air' so Hussein and his Boy Gabriel lifted" then the Imam recited:

_**"They will not believe in it until they see the grievious Penalty."**_

(The Holy Qur'an 26:201)

Then He took them the take of a Capable, Dear One."

Mufaddal asked "O Master did the companions of Hussein see Gabriel?"

The Imam replied "Yes"

- 66 -

Mufaddal asked "In one image or in different images?"

The Imam said "Rather, in our images."

Mufaddal said "O Master, when have I seen Gabriel?"

The Imam said "You have seen him today."

Mufaddal asked "In what time?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "In this Hour, would you like him to talk to you?"

Mufaddal said "By Allah, I would."

The Imam said "O Abul Khattab, are you Gabriel?"

Abul Khattab said "By Allah I am Gabriel, and by Allah I am the one who was sent to the Cursed, Umar ibn Saad, and I am the one who spoke to him and shoved his face into Hell, he and all his companions. And I am in charge of punishing them by His command and I am the companion of the First Adam and He commanded me to shout one Shout at Creation and the Connections were cut and I bounded them with Chains and Cuffs. And I am the companion of Noah and his invitation to his people to the worship of Allah and His Oneness but they did not acknowledge so I split them with the Typhoon and I am the companion of Abraham, Hussein, they denied him and threw him with fire. And I by Allah, was with him and nothing of the heat of the fire struck me, nor him and I am the Companion of Daniel and the Coffin and Scrolls and I by Allah wrote it with my hand and my writing and I never doubted and never doubt His Godhood.

And I am the companion of Moses and Jesus and Mohammed and I am Abul Khattab and the father of good I am the one who shouted a shout at the people of (Lot) and I destroyed them.

And I am between the hands of every Imam in every Age and Time in different Images and under different names I am with the Qaim, between his hands.

I blast the Oppressors with his Sword and he commands me and I obey him and I give life and death and distribute Sustenance by the command of my Lord"

Mufaddal said "Then two men approached whom I did not know."

So Imam Al Sadiq said "Do you know those two?"

Mufaddal said "No Master."

The Imam said "Those two are Michael and Israfel, one was in the East and the other in the West."

Mufaddal asked "O Master, what were they doing?"

The Imam replied "I sent them on a mission."

Mufaddal asked "Was Abul Khattab with you at the time of the Prophet of Allah and the time of the Prince of the Believers Ali?"

Abul Khattab replied "Yes, and at the time of Jesus and Moses and Abraham and Noah and before on the time of Adam, peace be upon him"

- 67 -

ughter him, he left his Body and Allah raised him unto Himself and prevented the enemies from him. And He had angered such a Powerful and Adamant Anger and neither of the Heavens and Earth and Mountains could compare in His Greatness.

He is able to make their Punishment Hurry upon them but He is Patient, with Strength and is not afraid of Power and His promise is never broken.

- 67 -

Mufaddal said "How Great is the Matter of my Lord"

Then Imam Al Sadiq looked at Mufaddal and said:

"O Mufaddal you have been given great privilege and have learned Esoteric/ Inner Knowledge so you must keep the secret of Allah and do not let anyone know about it except a faithful/dedicated friend/believer. If you tell the secret to our enemies then you have helped your own killing."

Mufaddal said "I shall do that and I, O Master, have seen wonders from the concealment of this creation and humans and how you advise us and order us with concealing it"

Imam Al Sadiq said "O Mufaddal, Verily Allah loves to be worshipped in Secrecy."

Mufaddal said "You have spoken the Truth O Master and Lord and all Praises are due to Allah, Lord of the Worlds."
