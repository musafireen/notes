الباب الثامن والخمسون فى معرفة تراكيب الكافر البار بأهل بيته 

وأهله وغيرهم؟ 

قال المفضل: سألت مولاي على ذكره السلام فقلت له: قد يكون فينا الكافر البار بأهله وعشيرته وسائر الناس، والكافر المؤذي لأهل بيته وغيرهم؟ قال: أما الكافر البار بأهله وغيرهم يكون لين الجائب سهل، وقد يكون فينا الكافر المؤدي إلى إخوانه و غيرهم. ففي ماذا يركبان ويردان؟ 

قال: أما الكافر البار بأهله المحسن إليهم، فإنه يركب في قالب أسد أو نمر وما أشبه ذلك. وما يناسب القوة والبطش فيكون قويا منيعا في أعين الناس، وذلك مما تقدم منه من الإحسان الذي ذكرته، فهو في تراكيبه مهابا. أما ترى إلى الرجل إذا مدح الرجل قال: لله دره كانه أسد أو ضرغامة يمدحونه وييجلونه. فهذا وما أشبه جزاء لما تقدم من أعماله، وأما الكافر المؤذي الأهل بيته وغيرهم فإنه يركب بيا وخنزيرة أو قرداً وما أشبه ذلك، فيكون خبيثا ضعيف القدر علينا وفي أعين الناس. أما ترى أن الإنسان إذا هجا إنساناً . قال: لعنه الله ما أقذره كاته دا او خنزيرة أو كلبة فيهجوه وينسبوه إلى النجاسة؟ كل ذلك مما تقدم منه إلى إخوانه وجيرانه وأقاربه، والله الأمر بأحكامه وله الحمد بما منه

**"In Knowing the Incarnations of the Disbeliever who is Righteous to his family and** **other than them and what is the cause in that?"**

Mufaddal asked Imam Al Sadiq, upon his mention peace "There might be within us a Disbeliever who is Righteous to his family, kinsfolk, and the rest of people..."And a Disbeliever that is harmful to his family and other than them?"

The Imam replied "As for the Disbeliever who is dutiful towards his family and other than them, he has a Tender Aspect, Facilitated. And we might have within us a Disbeliever who is hurtful to his brothers and other than them, so what do they ride and reincarnate into?

As for the Disbeliever who is dutiful to his family and is good to them, he rides in the mould of a Lion or Tiger or what is similar to that and what is appropriate for Strength and Violence so that he is Strong and Invincible in the eye of the people. And that is from what came forth from him of goodness that I mentioned for he in his Incarnations is admired.

Do you not see when the man compliments the man, he says 'It is as if he is a Lion' and they compliment him and make him pleased. That and the likes of it are repayment for what came forth of his works, as for the Disbeliever that is hurtful to his family and other than them, he rides into a Bear or Pig or Monkey or the likes of that, he is Wicked and Weak in power.

With us and in the eyes of the people, do you not see that the person if he satirizes another person he says 'God damn him, how disgusting is he, it is as if he is a Bear or Pig or Dog,' so they satirize him and attribute him to Impurity.

This is all from what came forth from him towards his Brothers and Neighbors and Relatives and to Allah is the matter with its Judgements and to Him is Praise with what is from Him. On the contrary to this Lizard, May Allah curse him, this wicked Lizard, he is a hater of the Ahlul Bayt, this amazing Lizard, Wicked.”

There is a narration from Imam Al Sadiq that someone was sitting with him and this Lizard was on the wall, sticking out its tongue.

Imam Al Sadiq said to the man "Do you know what he is saying?" and the man said "What?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "The lizard said 'If you curse our Uthman we shall curse your Ali!"

This Lizard is actually a Wicked Nasibi, he is Cursed, amazingly wicked he is wicked and cursed, when Nimrod lit the fire to burn Prophet Abraham, what did this Wicked creature do?

(He blew on it to make it burn more)
