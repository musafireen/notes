الباب الخامس والستون في معرفة ما جاء في تصحيح الأدمين السبعة قال المفضل: قلت لمولاي الصادق : إني قد سعت من الشيعة أشياء لا يقوى عليها قلبي. قال: حدثني عن بعض ما سمعت منهم إلا ذكرت لي شيء. قال: أردت يا مفضل أن تقول أنهم يقولون كان في الأرض سبعة أوادم قبل أن يخلق 

الله أدم؟ 

قلت: نعم يا مولاي، إن ذلك لمن قولهم. 

قال: صدقوا ، لأنه كان في الأرض سبع آدميين قبل أن يخلق الله آدم، وإن جبريل من القرن الأول وميكائيل من القرن الثاني، وإن الدور خمسين ألف عامة، فإذا بدأ الله بخلق آدميين كان كيف يثبتهم في الجنة خمسين ألف عامة، فإذا بدا الله بخلق أدم جعل أهل الجنة ملائكة، وجعل أهل النار في مكان آخر، ثم خلق الآدميين، وكنا أول مبعوثين إلى ذلك الخلق حججا. وعن محمد بن نصير عن يعقوب بن سالم قال : سال الصادق رجلا وأنا عنده عن الآية: «فَأَمَا الَّذِينَ شَقُوا فَفِي النَّارِ لَهُمْ فِيهَا زَفِيرٌ وَشَهِيقٌ * خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا مَا دَامَتِ السَّمَاوَاتُ وَالْأَرْضُ إِلَّا مَا شَاءَ رَبِّكَ إِنَّ رَبِّكَ فَعَالٌ لِمَا يُرِيدُ * وَأَمَا الَّذِينَ سُعِدُوا فَفِي الْجَنَّةِ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا مَا دَامَتِ السَّمَاوَاتُ وَالْأَرْضُ إِلَّا مَا شَاءَ رَبِّكَ عَطَاءً غَيْرَ مَجْذُودٍ». 

فقال: يعني غير ممنوع ثم قال: يا فلان لعلك تريد حديث الهفت؟ 

، 

قلت سيدي، وما حديث الهات؟ 

هذه 

قال: إنه كان في الأرض سبعة آدميين قبل ابيك آدم وكلهم قد عاشوا في الأرض وقامت 

عليهم القياسات وحوسبوا ودخلوا الجنة والنار، ثم خرجوا منها. 

قلت: جعلت فداك، أين المؤمنين؟ 

قال: فأما المؤمنين فيلحقون في الملائكة. 

اللهم العن الجبت والطاغوت 

فقلت: وأهل النار؟

قال: فيلحقون في المسوخ أما تقرأ في كتاب الله تعالى: «أَفَلَمْ يَهْدِ لَهُمْ كَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا قَبْلَهُمْ مِنَ الْقُرُونِ يَمْشُونَ فِى مَسَاكِنِهِمْ»، فهؤلاء القشاش الذين تراهم الخنزير والحب والكلب وابن آوى و ابن عرس. وعن الحسن بن علي بن أبي الحمزة عن أبيه عن أبي بصير قال: كنا جلوسا عند جعفر الباقر علينا منه السلام، فجرى ذكرهم. قال أبو جعفر عليهم لعنة الله فإنهما ضالآن مضلان، والله ما زال في القرون الأولى مبتدا اول ما بعث الله أدم على وجه الأرض، فإن الله جل ثناؤه، قد بعث مبعة آدميين قبل آدم فما زال في تلك الأمم الماضية والقرون السالفة حتى بعث الله محمدا فصنع ما وصفناه وما قد علمتموه وبلغكم منها. 

فهكذا أراد الله لهما حتى يبعث الله قائمهم فيخرجهما عضدين طريين فيحرقهما، والله لفتنة للناس بهما ذلك اليوم أعظم من فتنتهم بهما اليوم، ثم ينسفهما بالريح ثم إن الله يبدل السماء غير السماء والأرض غير الأرض، فحيننذ تستقيم الدنيا لنا. عن ابن عبد الله البرقي عن ابن عمر عن خالد بن سالم قالا: كنا جلوسا عند مولانا جعفر الصادق فذکرنا رجلا، فقال: لا أعرفه. 

:قالوا: إن رجلا ادرك مفاوز خراسان سبع مرات عامرة. 

قال عنه السلام: فكم ترون أدركها خراب؟ 

وسئل الصادق من الحاضرين عن الدنيا. 

قال: هي أربع مائة دور، والدور أربع مائة ألف سنة، وفي كل دور سبع آدميين، وفي كل دور آدم ونوح وإبراهيم وموسى وعيسى ومحمد . 

وعن محمد بن إسماعيل عن البداية قال: دخلت على أبي قلت له: جعلت فداك، قبل

آدمنا هل من آدم؟ قال: إن الدنيا خلقت إذا قريبة أيام البداية قبل أدمكم هذا أدميون غيره، ألم تقرأ قوله تعالى: 


**"In Knowing what Came in the Correction of the Seven Adamites"**

Mufaddal said to Imam Al Sadiq "I have heard some things from the Shia that my heart is not strong upon."

Imam Al Sadiq said "Tell me about some of what you heard from them, will you mention something". Then Imam Al Sadiq said "You wanted, O Mufaddal, to say that they say that there were Seven Adams in the Earth before Allah created Adam."

Mufaddal said "Yes, O Master, verily that's of their speech."

The Imam said "They have spoken the Truth, because there were Seven Adamites in the Earth before Allah created Adam. And Verily Gabriel was from the First Century. And Michael was from the Second Century. And Verily the Turn is 50,000 Years.

For if Allah began with creating the Adamites He would keep them in Paradise for 50,000

years. For if Allah began to create Adam He would make the inhabitants of Paradise Angels.

And He makes the inhabitants of Hell in another place. Then He created the Ademites and we were the first sent to that creation (as) Veils. And Mohammed ibn Nusayr narrated from Jacob ibn Salem' A man asked Imam Al Sadiq while I was there about this Verse:

_**"Those who are wretched shall be in the Fire: There will be for them therein (nothing**_

_**but) the heaving of sighs and sobs. They will dwell therein for all the time that the**_

_**heavens and the earth endure, except as thy Lord willeth. For thy Lord is the (sure)**_

_**accomplisher of what He planneth. And those who are blessed shall be in the Garden:**_

_**They will dwell therein for all the time that the heavens and the earth endure, except**_

_**thy Lord willeth giving without break."**_

(The Holy Qur'an 11:106-108)

So he said 'It means not forbidden' then he said 'O so and so, perhaps you are looking for the Hadith of the Haft?"

Mufaddal said "O Master, what is the Hadith of the Haft?"

"He said "There was in the Earth Seven Adamites before your Father Adam and all of them lived in the Earth and the Judgements have come upon them and they were judged and they entered Heaven and Hell. Then they were brought out of it."

Mufaddal said "May I be your ransom, where are the Believers?"

The Imam said "As for the Believers they catch up in the Angels."

Mufaddal said "What about the inhabitants of Hell?"

The Imam replied "They catch up in the Maskh, did you not read Allah's book when Allah said:

_**"It is not a warning to such men (to call to mind) how many generations before them**_

_**We destroyed, in whose haunts they (now) move?"**_

(The Holy Qu'ran 20-128)

- 114 -

Those are the Straws that you see the pig and the bear and the dog and the jackal and the weasel. And from Al Hassan ibn Ali Abi Al Hamza from his father from Abi Baseer narrates that:

"We were sitting at the father of Ja'far, Imam Al Baqir upon us peace from him, and they (Abu Bakr and Umar) were mentioned."

"Imam Al Baqir (father of Imam Al Sadiq) said "Upon them (Abu Bakr and Umar) is the Curse of Allah. They are Mislead and Misleading. And by Allah still in the First Centuries in the beginning first when Allah sent Adam on the face of the Earth. For Allah had sent Seven Adamites before Adam and they were in those past nations and centuries until Allah sent Mohammed; and he did what we described and have taught you and told you of, for that is what Allah wanted for those two until He sends the Qaim. So he brings them out nourished and flexible and then he burns them.

By Allah the Trial of the people because of those two in those Days will be Greater than the Trials of the people because of them today.Then he blows them up and away with the Wind.

Then Allah switches the Sky with another Sky, and the Earth with another Earth, it is then the Earth will stand upright to us."

From the son of Abdullah Al Barqi from the son of Omar from the son of Khalid son of Salem who said "We are sitting at Imam Ja'far Al Sadiq's And we mentioned a man. So he said "I do not know him". They said "Verily a man realized the ways of Khurasan seven times flourishing."

The Imam from him peace said "So how many times do you think he realized it in losses/ruins?"

And Imam Al Sadiq asked those present about the World, he said 'It is 400 Rounds and the Round is 400,000 years and in every round are Seven Adamites and in every round is Adam

And Noah

And Abraham

And Moses

And Jesus son of Mary

And Mohammed peace be upon them al .”

And from Mohammed son of Ismail about the Beginning he said: "I walked in on my father and said to him: "May my soul be ransomed for you, was there an Adam before our Adam?"

He replied "Verily the World was created then close to the days of the Beginning before your Adam there were other Adamites. Did you not read Allah's words?

«نَحْنُ قَدَرْنَا بَيْنَكُمُ الْمَوْتَ وَمَا نَحْنُ بِمَسْبُوقِينَ»، قدرة نشأت نشاة لا يعلمها إلا 

الله. 

فقال محمد بن إسماعيل كل آدم - يا مولاي كان بدوره محمد وعلي وفاطمة والحسن والحسين له ، وأبا بكر وعمر وعثمان وأنتم الأئمة باعبانكم وحدكم محمد بعينه، أم أسماء توافق الأسماء؟ 

قال الصادق نحن بأعيننا وجدنا محمد بعينه، وعلي وفاطمة والحسن والحسين ههه بعينهم و أبو بكر وعمر وعثمان بعينهم. 

ثم التفت الصادق وقال: إنا منا رسل الله ما دام الله في خلقه حاجة، فإذا بدأ الله أن 

يهلكهم رفعنا إليه، وإن بدا أن يخلق خلقا آخر كنا نحن الرسل إليهم. 

ثم إن المفضل قال: يا مولاي إن سلمان يملك في كل دور أربعة آلاف سنة. وعن المفضل قال: سألت مولاي أبو عبد الله قلت هل، يا مولاي، مع دنيانا هذه دنيا أخرى؟ فقال یا مفضل خلق مثل قبتكم هذه اثني عشر الف قبة، لو أخذت قبتكم هذه ووضعت في وسط قبة منها لم تبين فيها، ولكل قبة اثني عشر ألف باب، وعرض كل مصراع منها اثني عشر ألف عام، فيها صفوفة قيامة على أقدامهم حتى لو ألقيت إبرة ما وقعت إلا على رأس رجل منهم، يسبحون الله ويقتسمونه ويبلغون فلان وفلانا في 

تسبيحهم. 

قلت يا مولاي، من ذرية آدم هؤلاء؟ 

قال: لا يعرفون آدم ولا ذريته. 

اللهم العن الجبت والطاغوت 

قلت: يعرفونكم أنتم الأئمة يا مولاي؟ 

قال: نحن عندهم أعرف بنا من عندكم. 

۳۵ 

قال المفضل: قلت لمولاي الصادق : إلى أي شيء يصير المؤمنين إذا انتهوا؟ قال منه السلام ملائكة مقربين في جوار الرحمان بحثهم ويحدثونه، ويكشف لهم 

بعد روح الجنان 

قال المفضل: يا مولاي، إلى أين مصير الملاعين؟ 

قال - منه السلام- ممسوخين مثل الهوام حيات وعقارب. 

عن ابن سنان عن خراش النهري عن زرارة قال: كنت يوما عند أبي جعفر الباقر الكلام، فقال لی یا زرارة، ما عندك من حديث السبعة الكبار شيئا؟ 

فقلت: بلى، يا مولاي جعلت فداك ولكنها نفسي والله تحدثني أن أسألك فقال لي الباقر مرادك يا زرارة عن السبعة الآدميين فلقد كان قبل أبينا آدم ستة آدمیین قامت عليهم القيامات وحوسبوا ودخلوا الجنة والنار با زرارة ما علموا قالوا أَتَجْعَلُ فِيهَا مَنْ يُفْسِدُ فِيهَا وَيَسْفِكُ الدِّمَاءَ ، لولا ما قدر من الأمر 

الملائكة 

حين 

العظيم القديم. 

وعن الصادق قال : إذا سكن الله أولياءه الجنة و أعداءه النار فيصيرون إلى ما شاء الله، فإذا أحب الله تعالى أن يعيدهم جعل أهل الجنة ملائكة روحانيين، وكنا نحن رسله إلى خلقه. 

وعن الصادق أنه قال: إن في القرآن العظيم سبعة آيات ممكنة مختلفة في مخاطبة موسى وفرعون وإلى كل أدم منهم موسي وفرعون ستة منهم يفعل الله بهم ما يشاء وسابعهم هو آدمنا يجعل الله له الخلود. عن علي بن يوسف عن إبراهيم بن هشام عن إسماعيل بن عبد العزيز قال: قلت إلى 

۳۵ 

اللهم عجل لوليک الفرج 

الصادق : مولاي جعلت فداك، كان آدم قبل آدم أبونا هذا؟ 

قال منه السلام: نعم أدم قبل آدم حتى عذ احدى وعشرين آدم وإلى كل واحد عمره وعمر ولده في الدنيا والجنة والنار خمسون ألف سنة، ثم يصيرون أهل الجنة ملائكة وأهل النار فثاش. 

قال إبراهيم قال إسماعيل بن عبد العزيز: سألت الصادق - منه السلام فقلت: جعلت فداك - ، مرادي الهفتية. قال - منه السلام- : نعم يقول الله سبع سموات وفي مثلهن يقول سبع أرضين، وفي كل أرض آدم ونوح مثل نوحكم. 

قال صفوان بن صفوان بن يحيى عن الحصين منه السلام كان معه رجلان قال لأحدهما حنث فلان بما سمعت وحتك به أمس. وقال إنه كان قبلنا سبعة آدميين عاشوا وأولادهم واستكملوا أرزاقهم وقامت عليهم القيامات ودخلو الأجنة والنار، فكبر في قلب الرجل، فقال له: ها هو الحسين فاسأله فإنني لم أكذب عليك، فقال الحسين : إن القيامة تقوم عليهم، ثم يدخلون الجنة والنار، ثم تعود الأرض ليس فيها أحد يعبده. 

عن محمد بن سنان عن محمد بن الحي الخثعي عن كثير النواي قال: قلت له: ويلك يا كثير، ما أشد خلافك على أبي جعفر؟ 

قال: إني سمعت شيئا لا يحب أبدا. قال: قلت له ويلك، ما سمعت منه؟ 

:قال سمعته يقول: كانوا الآدميين كلهم يفتح بهم بمحمد وآله. 

وعن محمد بن إسماعيل عن جليس له عن أبي حمزة الثمالي قال: قلت إلى أبي عبد الله منه السلام جعلني الله فداك، أخبرني يا مولاي عن قول الله: «كل شيء هالك إلا وجهه له الحكم»؟ 

اللهم العن الجبت والطاغوت 

۳۵ 

قال: يا فلان، فيهلك كل شيء ولم يبق إلا وجه الله ، وهو أعظم من أن يوصف بوصف، ولكن معني كل شيء هالك إلا دينه ونحن الأئمة وجه الله الذي لا يؤتى إلا منه، لا نزال 

في عباد الله، ما دام الله فيهم رؤيا. 

قال الرجل: جطني الله فداك، ما الرؤيا يا مولاي؟ 

قال: حاجة فإذا لم يكن لله فيهم حاجة رفعنا إليه وصنع بهم ما أحب. 

وعن محمد بن سنان قال أبو عبد الله : إنا منا الرسل من الله إلى خلقه ما كان له في من حاجة، وإذا لم يكن فيهم حاجة رفعنا إليه حتى إذا أراد سبحانه وبدا له 

خلقه 

أن يخلق خلقا، كنا أول المبعوثين إليهم وهداية إلى الخلق وحججا عليهم. وعن الحسن بن محمود عن هابيل الضراب و أبيه إسماعيل الحسن، عن أبي رافع الموصلي عن جابر، قال أبو جعفر الباقر یا جابر، لم تزل حجج الله في خلقه ما كان له حاجة فإذا لم يكن له منهم حاجة رفعنا إليه ثم يهلكهم حرقا وغرقا، وكنا نحن الأئمة الحجة من بعدهم. وعن أبي عبد الله البرقي وعن محمد بن سنان وعن صالح بن زياد النيلي، عن يونس بن ظبيان قال: سألت مولانا الصادق عن قوله تعالى: « فَلَنَسْأَلَنَ الَّذِينَ أُرْسِلَ إِلَيْهِمْ وَلَنَسْأَلَنَ الْمُرْسَلِينَ * فَلَنَقْصَنَ عَلَيْهِمْ بِعِلْمٍ وَمَا كُنَّا غَائِبِينَ ». قال الصادق قال: فالذين نسألهم وما نسألهم إلا بعد فراقهم من الدنيا ولسوف 

يعلمون. 

.(( 

وعن حسين بن يوسف عن أخيه عن أبيه سيف بن عميرة الحنفي قال: سألت مولانا جعفر عن قوله تعالى: كُلّ شَيْءٍ هَالِكٌ إِلَّا وَجْهَهُ »؟ 

فقال: نحن الأئمة في عباده لسانه الذي ينطق به وأيده في خلقه، ونحن وجه الله الذي یؤنى منه، لا نزال في عباده له ما دام الله له فيهم رؤية. 

۳۵ 

اللهم عجل لوليک الفرج 

قال الرجل: ما الرؤية يا مولاي؟ 

قال الحاجة، فإذا لم يكن له فيهم حاجة رفعنا إليه كيف ما شاء صنعا. ثم قال: سمعت أبو عبد الله م يقول: ما خلق الله خلقا قبل محمد أكرم على الله من 

محمد الله الله 

السلام 

وعن محمد بن أبي عبد الله البرني عن إسحاق بن عمار، سأل أبو عبد الله وهو جالس، فقال له: يا مولاي، أسألك بالذي ميثاق العلماء عنده لينبيء الناس ولا يكتمونه أن تنبيني بالذي أسألك عنه. 

فقال له الصادق منه السلام - إسأل عما شئت. قال ،مولاي، قوله كل يوم هو في شان، فما حجبه في شأنه الذي يحدث؟ قال الصادق : نحن الأئمة به، وإن منا رسله إلى جميع خلقه ما دام الله في خلقه حاجة، وإذا أراد تعالى هلاك خلقه رفعنا إليه، وإذا بدا له تعالى في إنشاء خلقه خلقا آخر كنا أول مبعوثين، وكنا ولاة ذلك الخلق. وعن عبد الله القاسم قال سمعت أبو عبد الله الصادق - منه السلام- يقول: إقامنا رسل الله للخلق ما دام الله في خلقه حاجة. وعن الإمام الباقر قال: إن الله بدا بأدوار مطلع الشمس وأجرى شمسها أربعون صباحا من غداة إلى الليل ما بها شمس ولا قمر فضيائها من نورها ما مفك عليها دم حرام ولا عمل خطية ولا يدرون الله كيف خلق ابليس. 

قلت: 

وعن أبي قال: دخلت عليه فسألني ما عندك يا بني من الأحاديث السبعة؟ عندي شيء كثير ، وقد هممت أن أوقد لها تارة وأحرقها. قال: هات ما أنكرت منها فخطر في بالي الآدميون. قال: وما كان علم الملائكة حين قال: «أتجعل فيها من يفسد فيها ويسفك الأماء». 

اللهم العن الجبت والطاغوت 

۳۵ 

قال أبو جعفر مر رسول الله و برجال من أصحابه وهم يتكلمون، فقال لهم: فما أنتم مفتكرون؟ 

قالوا له: يا رسول الله، نفتكر في القمر كيف لا يسير في السماء كما تسير النجوم في 

السماء إذا رمي بها. فقال: نعم في هذا تتفكرون إن لله تسعة وثلاثون ارضاء ليس فيها شمس وقمر، تضيء تل تلك الأرض بنورها ولا يعلم أحد أن أحدا يعمل في المعاصي، وإن أرضكم هذه 

تمام الأربعين. 

من 

ثم قال: إني ظننت ما من أرض حتى أنالها الله ووطنت ولا فيها موضع تقهر فيها جهته 

ملك ساجداً أو قدماه واقفا قائمة. وعن محمد الباقر أنه قال إلى زرارة يا زرارة، إن الله أرضا بيضاء، ضوءها من نورها، ليس فيها شمس ولا قمر وفيها خلق لا يعلمهم إلا الله، ولم يعصوا الله طرفة عين. 

فقال زرارة: وإبليس، أين هو؟ 

قال الباقر: لا يعلمون أن الله خلق إبليس. 

قال: جعلت فداك، من هم ولد آدم؟ 

قال: يعلمون أن الله خلق آدم. وعن الصادق قال أبونا آدم: إن اله صنع تسعة وثلاثون قبة من ولد آدم. 

وعن حمیران قال سألت الباقر عن الملائكة وقولهم قالوا أَتَجْعَلُ فِيهَا مَنْ يُفْسِدُ فِيهَا وَيَسْفِكُ الدِّمَاءَ ؟ قال: من أين علموا ذلك الملائكة إلا فيما كان قبل؟ وعن الباقر أنه قال: مر على والدنا أمير المؤمنين علي بن أبي طالب رجل فقال له: يا أمير المؤمنين، فما هذه الأنساب التي ينسب الناس إليها؟ 

۳۶۰ 

اللهم عجل لوليک الفرج 

فدعاه وقال له: إنتسب. 

قال: نعم أنتسب إلى عاد و ثمود وقارون وبين ذلك كثير، فقال: إنك لا تعرف تنسب، أنا أنسبكم وأنا على سابع سبع أسابيع الأدميين. 

وقال رسول الله : إن لله ثمانية عشر الف عالم، والدنيا فيها عالم واحد، وفي الدنيا 

ألف أمة سوى الجن والإنس من مائة في البحر وأربعمائة في البر. 

وعن الصادق أنه قال: كان ثلاثة أدوار سبع مائة ألف سنة ودور سبعين ألف سنة 

ودور سبع آلاف سنة. 

وعن الباقر قال: حدثت عن بني إسرائيل فقال رجل: جعلت فداك، والله في أحاديث السبعة ما هو أعجب من أحاديثهم. 

قال الباقر : لعلك يا رجل تريد الهقتية؟ 

قال نعم. 

فقال الباقر : فصدق بها فإنها حق. 

وعن محمد بن علي عن أمير المؤمنين يقول: إن بعدي فتا مظلمة عمياء مشكلة لا 

يبقى فيها إلا النومة. 

قيل: وما النومة؟ 

قال: الذي لا يدري الناس ما في نفسه. 

وعن الباقر أنه قال: اثنتان بين يدي هذا الأمر كسوف القمر الخمس وكسوف الشمس الخمس عشر، يكون ذلك من هبوط أدم إلى الأرض، فعند ذلك يسقط حساب 

المنجمين. 

وعنه عن يحيی بن عمران قال سمعت علی بن الحسين يقول: من أدرك قائمنا وكان ذا علة بريء منها، ومن مرض شفي منه، وقال ابن الحسين هالكون ولد 

اللهم العن الجبت والطاغوت 

۳۶۱ 

العباس على يدي قائمنا على ذكره السلام و عن يحيى ابن عمران قال: سألت أبا عبد الله جعفر عن غيبة هذا الأمر متى يكون وما علامه غيبته؟ 

قال الصادق خسف تخوم نهاوند وعند فوات الحسين عقبة حلوان ورجفة تصيب أهل ،فارس، وزلزلة تصيب أهل الروم، فإذا رأيت ذلك وسمعت به فیقین لغيبة صاحب 

هذا الأمر. 

قلت يا مولاي جعلت فداك، غيبته حتماً من الله؟ قال: هكذا أخرج إلينا و أمره إلى الله إن شاء مضى وان شاء أبطأ. قال مولاي – أين تكون غيبته؟ 

قال الصادق منه السلام من وراء قافكم. 

قال: يا مولاي ليس وراء قاقنا المحيط بالدنيا شيء؟ ثم ابتسم وقال: فإنني أخبرك عن ذلك ولا احرمك إنشاء الله، فمن وراء قافكم هذا مدن شتى كل مدينة لها اثني عشر ألف باب، وعلى كل باب في كل يوم وليلة اثني عشر ألف رجلا لا ينوبهم إلى يوم. 

قال یا مولانا، وكم عدد المدن؟ 

قال الصادق : تسعة وثلاثين قبة سوى قبة أدم. قال: يا مولاي، من أولاد آدم؟ 

قال الصادق : هم لا يعلمون أن الله خلق آدم. 

:قال وهل يتخطاهم يا مولاي إبليس بخيله؟ 

قال الصادق : إنهم لا يعلمون أن الله خلق اليس. 

قال: يا مولاي جعلني الله فداك، كيف يخترق القائم على ذكره السلام إليهم؟ قال: يخترق من حيث يشاء الله يصير بينهم. 

قال: يا مولاي أين تكون غيبته وفي أي مدينة يسكن من هذه المدن؟

قال الصادق : يسكن أينما شاء والله الموفق لنا ولكم. 

قال: يا مولاي فهل يصير إليهم أحد منكم؟ 

قال الصادق : نعم نحن حجج الله فيهم وعليهم يؤدون إلينا خمس مالهم لا 

الله طرفة عين، قال: يا مولاي وفي أي الأوقات مصيركم إليهم؟ 

يعصون 

قال الصادق : إذا كنا ههنا فنحن هناك، وإذا كنا هناك فنحن ههناء :قال يا مولاي، من غير نقلة ولا سفر ؟ 

فتبسم الصادق وقال : لا يحملتك حبنا أن تقول فينا بخلاف الحق، نحن عباد الله المكرمون لا نسبقه بالقول ونحن بأمره تعمل ونخافه بالغيب ونحن من خشيته مشفقون سبحانه ما أعطانا الخيرات كلها إلا بحمده ونحن خزان علمه وموضع سره ومستودع علمه وورثة أنبيائه ورسله وحججه على عباده من خلقه، اصطفانا الله، لا نقدر لأنفسنا على ضر ولا نفع إلا بما شاء، إن الذي وصفته لك بقدرة ربنا. 

قال: يا مولاي جعلت فداك من أين خروج قائمكم؟ قال الصادق من بيت الله الحرام، وأول من يصافحه بالبيعة جبريل في سبعين ألف ملك، ولا يبقى ملك في السماء إلا بايعه. 

قال: يا مولاي عندي مسائل يمنعني إجلالك أن أسألك عنها. 

قال الصادق : يرحمك الله أمرنا ربنا أن نعرفكم كلما تحتاجون إليه، فاسأل عما بدا 

لك. 

قال: يا مولاي، منذ كم خلق الله الدنيا وكم يكون ابتداؤها إلى القضائها؟ قال الصادق خمسون ألف دور ، وكل دور أربعمائة ألف كور وكل كور أربعمائة ألف 

سنة. 

قال: يا مولاي جعلني الله فداك هذا الأمر لا ينقطع؟ 

اللهم العن الجبت والطاغوت 

۳۶ 

قال الصادق : علم ذلك عند الله، يرى الساعة قريبة ونراها بعيدة. 

قال: يا مولاي، أين الجنة؟ 

قال: ههنا. 

:قلت مولاي في الدنيا؟ 

قال: نعم. 

قلت له: وأين النار؟ 

قال: في حيث يشاء الله . 

:قلت: مولاي الجنة في الأرض ؟ 

قال: نعم، إن الله قال: «وَقَالُوا الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِي صَدَقَنَا وَعْدَهُ وَأَوْرَثَنَا الْأَرْضَ نَتَبَوَأُ مِنَ 

الْجَنَّةِ حَيْثُ نَشَاءُ فَنِعْمَ أَجْرُ الْعَامِلِينَ 

.(( 

قال: يا مولاي للجنة والنار مدة وانقطاع؟ 

قال: نعم لأن الله تعالى قال في قصتة الجنة والنار: «خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا مَا دَامَتِ السَّمَاوَاتُ 

وَالْأَرْضُ إِلَّا مَا شَاءَ رَبِّكَ ». 

قال: يا مولاي إلى أين مصير أهل الجنة والنار؟ قال منه السلام أهل النار يصيرون قشاشة. قلت يا مولاي ما القشاش؟ 

قال: البق والذباب والنمل وما يشبه ذلك. 

:قال يا مولاي ينقلون من شيء إلى شيء؟ 

قال الصادق : نعم، وينقلون من خلق إلى خلق، فهذا هو العذاب الأكبر. 

قال: يا مولاي، وأهل الجنة إلى ماذا يصيرون؟ 

قال ملائكة. 

۳۶ 

اللهم عجل لوليک الفرج 

قلت: بأعينهم؟ 

قال: يصيرون إنسيون روحانيون. 

:قلت يا مولاي لا ينقلون من شيء إلى شيء. 

قال الصادق : لا 

:قلت يا مولاي ما يصيرون الأنميات والحور العين وأين يكون مسكن أهل الجنة؟ قال: يحدث الله إلى كل مؤمن جنة على حدة ويتخذ له فيها أصور ويصبرون الأنميات والحور العين إلى أزواجهن. 

قال: يا مولاي، وأين يتخذ لهم الجنان في الأرض وفي أي موضع؟ 

قال: بين قوائم الكرسي. 

قال: يا مولاي، وأين قوائم الكرسي؟ 

ألف 

قال الصادق : الكرسي في طولها ألف ألف قائمة بين القائمة والقائمة مسيرة ألف عام، وكذلك عرضها وله ممن الله في كل موقف سبعون ألف زوارة، وكلما زاروا 

ورجعوا إلى مساكنهم وقد زادوا سبعين ضعفة مثل الذي أعطى قبل ذلك. قلت يا مولاي إن هذا لهو الفضل الكريم ، وهل هم في هذه الجنان أنعم عيشة أم في هذه اللجنة الأولى؟ فتبسم الصادق منه السلام، ثم قال: يا بشار ، أما الجنات الأولى جوار الله خير من الجنة الثانية، أما علمت أن الله يبدلهم في الجنات الأولى لقربه وجواره فاختار بهم 

من رؤيته. 

قال: يا مولاي: ينقل الآدميات من حال إلى حال؟ 

، 

قال الصادق نعم يا بشار ينقلون من جلس إلى جنس ومن طيب إلي طيب ومن نور إلى نور ، ومن نعمة إلى نعمة، إلى أفضل النعم. 

اللهم العن الجبت والطاغوت 

۳۶ 

قال يا مولاي الحمد لله الذي لم يعط من علمه أحدا غيركم، اختصكم بفضله دون 

خلقه 

جميع 

قال الصادق یا بشار يرحمك الله اكتم سر ما أودعتك من مكنون من 

اليمه. 

ثم قال الصادق : أمر القائم وقيامه إلى الله وحده. 

قلت يا مولاي، أليست له علامات؟ 

قال الصادق : بلی له علامات شتی. 

قلت: ما هي يا مولاي؟ 

الله 

وحده 

قال الصادق : تارا تقبل من ههنا ، وأومأ بيده إلى ناحية القبلة، وإلى ناحية الشرق. 

قلت يا مولاي، كل ذلك في ليلة واحدة؟ 

قال الصادق : نعم، ومسخا يكون في الهند والسند، ويدخل الحسين حلوان. :قلت يا مولاي إلى أي موضع بريد؟ 

قال الصادق : يريد مدينة محدثة، على شاطيء سيحان البصرة. 

قلت يا مولاي، أليس هي الزوراء؟ 

قال: لا. 

قلت: مولاي، ثم ماذا يكون؟ 

قال: نزول العسكر على شاطيء سيحان البصرة ويخرج على شاطيء الآجلة من البصرة رجل من ولد أبي بريد دخولها فيمنع من ذلك اشد المنع، ويعود خارجا منها، ويجيش إليه الجيوش من بني مرداس ويكون بينه وبينهم وفعات عديدة، ولم يزالوا والله على ذلك حتى يقتل عن بده ما ينوف عن ستين ألفاء. قلت يا مولاي ثم ماذا يكون؟

قال الصادق منه السلام لا يزال كذلك حتى يدخلها ويقتل عاملها وعامل بني ،مرداس فيقيم بها ما شاء الله، ثم يبايعه أهلها كار هين غير طائعين، ويؤتون إليه العشر، فإذا اطمان و استمسك غدروا به وكبسوا منزله ليلا فيقتلون أصحابه وينهبون منازلهم وهو يخلص نفسه ويفر من أصحابه وأهلها ويخرج هاربة منها ويرفع أصحابه بني مرداس رأس أحدهم على قناة ويزعموا أنهم قتلوه، وإن رأيت ربع رأسه على سريري أو بيدي فلا تصدق بقتله، فإنه يخرج والله هاربا منها ويسلم برأسه، ويذهب حتى يأتي اليمن، فيجتمع إليه الناس من قبائل العرب والموالي أقوام كرام الأخلاق، ثم يخرج بهم حتى يوافي كوفاتكم، ويقيم فيها ما شاء الله. فيجتمع إليه قوم من أهل الكوفة، ويخرج منها حتى يوافي البصرة، فيكبسها ليلا ويدخلها ويقتل منها خلقا كثيرا ويحرق بها قبائل كثيرة، ثم يرجع إلى الكوفة. وقال بشار يا مولاي، ثم بعد ذلك 

ماذا يكون؟ 

قال الصادق لم یصیر ما یرید. 

قال: يا مولاي جعلت فداك، أسرع بالجواب ما سألتك إلا مريدا إلى ذلك. قال الصادق : اعلم أن أحد أتباعنا لا يزال بالكوفة يحيي خراجها ويصرفه في أصحابه، ويخرج خمسه ويدفعه إلى أهله. 

قال: يا مولاي فالين يكون صاحب هذا الأمر يومئذ في غيبته؟ 

قال الصادق حيث شاء الله تعالى. قلت يا مولاي، وقد روي لنا عن أبيك محمد الباقر أن صاحب هذا الأمر غيبته في 

بعض أشعابكم. فتبستم الصادق ثم قال صدق والدي، إن صاحب هذا الأمر من وراء قافكم 

المحيط بالعلم في بر وبحر. ثم قال الصادق : بل في مدن شتى. 

اللهم العن الجبت والطاغوت

قال: يا مولاي، فما نصنع بالذي قد روي عن أبيك ؟ 

قال الصادق : اعلموا انت وإخوانك أنه ما زال منازل الرجال عندنا على قدر احتمالهم عنا. قال خليل الله إبراهيم: «إني مقيمه، ولم سقيم؟ أفتراه كان كاذبة؟ لا والله، ولكنه كان صادقا وهو أعلم بما قال صلى الله عليه وسلم. 

ثم قال: يا مولاي من في تلك المدائن من ولد آدم؟ 

قال: لا يعلمون أن الله خلق آدم . 

:قلت يا مولاي، فيتخطاهم إبليس. 

قال: لا يعلمون أن الله خلق إبليس. 

قال بشار يا مولاي، يعرفونكم حق المعرفة. 

قال الصادق : نعم يأتوننا بالفواكه بغير أوانها ويوردون إلينا خمسنا الذي فرضه 

السلام: 

وأوجبه الله لنا في كتابه وهم أطوع لنا منكم. 

قال: يا مولاي بعث الله إليهم الرسل كما قد بعث إلى ولد آدم. 

قال الصادق : نعم بعث الرسل إلى كافة الخلق وإلى من دون العرش وجميع من 

خلق. 

قال: يا مولاي، وأقروا بولايتكم؟ 

قال الصادق : من أنكر أحدة منا فإنه إلينا ولا ولينا أنكروه ولا ينكروننا، نحن منار الله في أرضه، ثم أمناؤه على خليقته. 

فقلت: الحمد لله الذي عرفتني غاية فضلكم. قال الصادق منه السلام يرحمك الله ما عرف الله أحدا غاية فضلنا إلا مقدار شعرة بيضاء في ثور أسود. وأما مقدار فضلنا وعلمنا في علم الله وفضله إلا مقدار ما حمل الطائر بمنقاره من البحر التي ذكره الله تعالى في كتابه.

اللهم عجل لوليک الفرج 

قال: يا مولاي الحمد لله الذي لا شبيها له إلا الله الذي لا صلة له ولا نعت. ثم قال: ربنا قبل القبل وخالق القبل وبعد البعد وخالق البعد وغاية كل غاية ومنشيء كل شيء وخالقه وإبداء البداية وأزل النهاية. 

ثم إن الصادق لصق خده في الأرض والله سمعته يقول ذلك: ربي ومجيري، وسيدي وسندي وخالقي ورازقي وإن شاء عذبني فيحرمني وإن شاء رحمني فیفضله، ويل يومئذ للمكذبين. 

ملائكته. 

ثم إن الصادق جعل يقلب خذه على التراب وإنه يقول: أنا عبدك وابن عبدك وابن 

: ابن عبدك ، وابن أمتك، أصبحت فقيرا إلى رحمتك مؤمنا بوعدك، اسيرا بعمل مرتهنأ به، يا إلهي ارحم زلتي وفقري، وارحم فاقتي يا مولاي بالنصر على أعدائي، فلولا نصرك كنت من المغلوبين ثم إن الصادق رفع رأسه وقال كلاما غير مسموع. فقال: لبيك، مولاي. قال الصادق استر ما كشفناه إليك من علم الله الذي ستره من :قال يا مولاي، متي يكشف هذا الغطاء؟ قال فبكى أبو عبد الله حتى جرت دموعه ثم قال: ربعي ان شاء الله الذي له الحول والقوة بالخلق والأمر إن شاء الله تعالى له على الثقاة الأمناء. وعن أبو عبد الله أنه قال: لما احتضر رسول الله محمد الوفاة قال: يا علي إذا متّ فغستلني وحتطني وألبسني وأجلسني أخبرك بما يكون إلى يوم القيامة، فلما توفي غسله على وحتطه، وألبسه، ثم أجلسه فأخبره محمد بما يكون إلى يوم القيامة. وروي أن عبد المطلب بن هاشم قال في قصة إبراهيم ابن الأشرم أبياتا له وهي المتممة الساكنة في مجراها للتفاهم وهي هذه.

ولنا أمر شريف علمه 

ولنا الأنوار من باري النسم. 

تم ذلك والفضل من الله عليه توكلنا. سال بعض العارفين عن أخبار الباطن فقال له: من لم يعرف الأمر من جهته يكون من الأبدان البشرية حتى يبلغ إلى المنتهي في المعرفة، على أن يكون ممن يغشى عليكم فيؤخذ بزمام زوجه فتخرج من دار المعرفة إلى دار الإنكار، فيكون من 

الخاسرين. 

وعن أبي على الكوفي قال: كنت عند الباقر، فدخل إلى عنده رجل أحمر عليه ثیاب ،خضر فقال: السلام عليكم يا أبا جعفر ورحمة الله وبركاته، فرد عليه الباقر بأحسن سلام. 

فقلت له: من أنت يا رجل – يرحمك الله ؟ 

فقال لي: أنا أخوك وصاحبك حين أتيتك بخراسان، فأضفتني بليلة كذا وكذا. فقال أبو علي الكوفي لأبي جعفر الباقر منه السلام - لم أره في هذه الهيئة يا مولاي. 

فتبسم الباقر ام ثم قال: هو من المحجوبين، يحتجب بما شاء 

فقال يا مولاي وما بلغ من حقيقة إيمانه؟ 

فقال الباقر : یا دوال لم يكثر على الله شيء لقربه إليه. 

قلت یا مولاي، وما أغفل الناس عن مثل هذه، وغاب الرجل. 

فقال الباقر - منه السلام هذا عبد إن سألت فقد أعطاه ست حجم حجب بها حيث يشاء من ملكوت السماء والأرض. 

فقلت يا مولاي ما أعظم حق المؤمن عند الله. 

فقال الباقر با دوال لا تتكبر على عبد الله فتجعل ثوابك إلى ذلك فتهلك، فإن إلى كل أمين مؤمن سبع حجب، إذا خرجت من أبدانه وانكشفت عنه صار في جوار 

ذلك. 

اللهم العن الجبت والطاغوت

فقال الدوال يا مولاي صف ما نقته من حلاوة الإيمان فإلى ما يصير المؤمنون في الآخرة إذا انتهوا؟ قال الباقر ملائكة مقربين في جوار الرحمان ويحتلهم ويحدثونه بعد روح الجنان. قال: يا مولاي إلى أين يصيروا الملاعين ممن خالفكم؟ 

قال: هوام ومسخ من الهوام حيات وعقارب وخنازير ومن لا خير فيه بعد شدة العذاب والله أعلم أن رحمته وسعت كل شيء وهو أرحم الراحمين، تم.

_**"We have decreed Death to be your common lot, and We are not to be frustrated"**_

(The Holy Qur'an 56:60)

Power that arose an upbringing that no one knows but Allah."

"So Mohammed son of Ismail said "Every Adam, O Master, has in his turn a Mohammed and Ali and Fatima and Hassan and Hussein And Abu Bakr and Umar and Uthman and you the Imams particularly or are they names that match?"

Imam Al Sadiq replied "It is us precisely and our grandfather Mohammed precisely and Ali and Fatimah and Hassan and Hussein precisely. And Abu Bakr and Umar and Uthman precisely" then Imam Al Sadiq turned and said:

"Verily from us are the Messengers of Allah so long that Allah's creation is in need."

- 115 -

Mercy and Getting along being in one Line, and the gathering of one word and the Obediance to Allah and His Prophet and those entrusted with affairs. Is a truth in accordance with Allah's words:

_**"O You who believe, obey Allah and the Prophet and those entrusted with the affairs**_

_**from you"**_

(The Holy Qur'an 4:59)

And if Allah begins to destroy them, He raises us to Him. And if He begins to create another creation, we are the Messengers to them."

Then Mufaddal said "O Master, Verily Salman owns in every Round 4,000 years."

And Mufaddal said "I asked Abu Abdullah (Imam Sadiq) and said 'Is there, O Master, another World with our World?"

So he (sawas) replied 'O Mufaddal, there has been created like this Dome of yours 12,000

Domes.

If you took this Dome of yours and placed it in between a Dome of those it would not show in it. And for every Dome is 12,000 Doors. And the length of every Hemistitch of it is 12,000

years and in it are lines, standing on their feet such that if you threw a needle it would fall on one of their heads undoubtedly. They praise Allah and Venerate Him and inform so and so in their praises."

Mufaddal said "O Master, are those from the seed of Adam?"

The Imam said "They do not know Adam nor his seed."

Mufaddal said "They know you, the Imams O Master"

Imam Al Sadiq said "We are known better by them than by you"

Mufaddal asked Imam Al Sadiq "What do the Believers become if they complete/finish?"

He said from him peace "Angels close in the company of the Merciful, He speaks to them and they speak to Him and He is disclosed to them after the Spirit of the Heavens."

Mufaddal said "O Master, where is the destination of the cursed?"

The Imam from him peace said "They are in Maskh like the Pests, Snakes and Scorpions."

And from Ibn Sinan from Khrash Al Nahry from Zurarah who said "One day I was at the father of Ja'far, Imam Ali Baqir's from him peace. He said to me 'O Zurarah, do you not have anything from the Hadith of the Seven Greats/Elders?"

Zurarah said "Indeed, O Master, may my soul be ransomed for you, but it is in my Self by Allah that speaks to me to ask you."

So Al Baqir said to me "Your request O Zurarah about the Seven Adamites. For before our father Adam, peace be upon him, there were six Adamites that have already had their Judgements and they were accounted for and placed in Heaven and Hell O Zurarah. The Angels did not know when they said:

_**'Will you make it who shall corrupt in it and shed blood. Were it not for that was**_

_**deemed from the Great Ancient Matter/Command."**_

(The Holy Qur'an 2:30)

- 116 -

And from Imam Al Sadiq who said "If Allah places his Preferred in Heaven and his enemies in the Fire, they become whatever Allah wills. For if Allah loves to bring them back, He makes the inhabitants of Heaven into Spiritual Angels, and we are His Messengers to His creation."

Imam Ja'far Sadiq said "In the Mighty Qur'an, there are seven verses of different possibilities for Moses' speech to Pharaoh. Each Adam (Mankind) had a Moses and Pharaoh, so six before that Allah will do with them whatever He Wills and the Seventh is our Adam's, the one whom Allah will cause to live forever."

From Ali son of Yousef from Ibrahim son of Hesham from Ismael son of Abdul Aziz who said

'I said to Imam Al Sadiq: "May my soul be ransom for you, was there an Adam before our father Adam?"

"He (Imam Al Sadiq) from him peace said "Yes Adam before Adam until he counted to 21

Adams and to each one his age and the age of his offspring in the World and Heaven and the Fire for 50,000 years then the inhabitants of Heaven became Angels and the inhabitants of the Fire/Hell become Straws"

Ibrahim said that Ismail ibn Abdul Aziz said "I asked Imam Al Sadiq from him peace and said

'May I be your ransom, my aim is the Haft-iya"

He, from him peace, said "Yes, Allah says Seven Skies and Seven Earths alike and in every Earth is Adam and Noah like your Noah"

Safwan son of Safwan son of Yahya from Imam Al Hussein from him peace "He had with him two men and he said to one of them: "Tell so and so about what you heard and what I told you about yesterday. He said there were before us Seven Adamites that lived and their children and they completed their sustenance and they were judged and they entered Heaven and the Fire/Hell. But it was too much in the man's heart" So he said to him "There is Al Hussain, so ask him for I have not lied to you."

So Hussein said 'Verily the Judgement day goes upon them then they enter Heaven and the Fire/Hell. Then the Earth returns without anyone in it worshipping Him. From Mohammed ibn Sinan from Mohammed son of Alhay alkhuthiy from Kathir Anlnoway who said 'I said to him:

"Woe to you O Kathir, how great are your differences about the father of Ja'far?"

He said 'I heard something not loved ever"

He said 'I said to him "Woe to you, what did you hear from him?"

He said 'I heard him say that all the Adamites were begun/opened with Mohammed and his Family."

And from Mohammed son of Ismail from Abi Hamza Al Shamali who said 'I said to Abu Abdullah from him peace:

"May Allah make me your ransom, tell me O Master about the saying of Allah that everything will face except His face, and to Him is praise"

He said 'O so and so, everything will fade and nothing will remain except the face of Allah and He is Greater than to be described with a description. But the meaning is everything is fading except His religion and we, the Imams are the face of Allah that nothing is given except from it. We still remain in the Worshippers/Servants of Allah so long that Allah has in them a Vision."

The man said 'May Allah make me your ransom, what is the Vision, O Master?"

- 117 -

He said 'A Wish/Need, for if He didn't have in them a need He raises us to Him and He does with them what He likes."

And from Mohammed son of Sinan who said Abu Abdullah said 'Verily from us are the Messengers from Allah to His creation. So long that He has a need in His creation, and if He didn't have a need in them He raises us to Him until He desires and He begins to create a creation. We were the first sent to them and as guidance to the creation and veils upon them."

And from Hassan son of Mahmoud from Habil Al Darab and his father Ismail Al Hassan Abu Rafii'Al Mowsali from Jabbir:

The father of Ja'far, Imam Al Baqir said 'O Jabir, Allah's proofs in His creation still remain so long that Allah has a need in them. For if He did not have a need from them He raises us to Him then He destroys them by Burning and Drowning and we the Imams are the proofs after them."

And from Abi Abdullah Al Barqi and from Mohammed son of Sinan and from Saleh son of Ziyad Al Niily, from Yunus son of Dubyan who said: "I asked our Master Al Sadiq about the words of Allah:

_**"Then shall we question those to whom Our message was sent and those by whom**_

_**We sent it. And verily, we shall recount their whole story with knowledge, for We were**_

_**never absent (at any time or place)."**_

(The Holy Qur'an 7:6-7)

Imam Al Sadiq said: "He said 'For the ones we ask and we do not ask them except after their parting from the World and verily they shall know."

And from Hussein son of Yousef from his brother from his father Sayf son of Umaira Al Hanafi who said "I asked Imam Jafar about Allah's words:

_**"Everything shall perish except His face"**_

(The Holy Qur'an 28:88)

Imam Al Sadiq said "We, the Imams in His Servants are His Tongue that He pronounces with and His Hand in His Creation. And we are the face of Allah that gifting is from, we still remain amongst His worshippers so long as Allah has in them a Vision."

The man said "What is the Vision, O Master?”

The Imam said "Need/Desire for if He did not have a need in them, He raised us to Him and did as He pleases."

Then he said "I heard Abu Abdullah say 'Allah did not create a creation before Mohammed dearer to Allah than Mohammed."

And from Mohammed Abi Abdullah Al Barqi from Ishaq son of Amar who asked Abu Abdullah while he was sitting and said to him: O Master, I ask you by the covenant that the Scholars have to inform the people and not hold back, that you tell me about what I ask you."

So Imam Al Sadiq from him peace said to him "Ask about whatever you like."

He said "O Master, His saying that every day He is in a matter/affair, so what are His veils in His affairs that He speaks of."

- 118 -

Imam Al Sadiq said "We the Imams are His Veils and verily from us are His Messengers to all His creation so long that Allah has a need to His creation. And if Allah wanted the destruction of His creation He raises us to Him and if Allah began to create a new creation we are the first sent and we were the Guardians of that creation."

And from Abdullah Al Qasim who said "I heard Abu Abdullah Al Sadiq from him peace say

'Verily from us are the Messengers of Allah to Creation so long as Allah has a need in His creation."

And Imam Al Baqir said "Verily Allah started with the rounds of the Sun rise and ran its Sun 40 Mornings from morning till night without it having a Sun or Moon, for its light is from its own Light. No Haram blood has been spilled on it nor any Sin committed on it and they do not know Allah has created Iblis. And from my father who said when I went in upon him

“What is with you O my son of the Seven Hadiths?"

I said 'I have a lot and I worried that I light a fire for it and burn it"

He said 'Give me what you denied of it' so the Adamites crossed my mind. He said 'And it was not the knowledge of the Angels when they said 'Will you make in it who corrupts in it and spills blood.'

The father of Ja'far said "The Prophet of Allah passed by men from his companions and they were talking so he said to them 'What are you thinking about?" They said 'O Prophet of Allah, we are thinking about the moon and how it does not travel in the sky as the Stars travel if thrown with."

So he said 'Yes in this do you think, verily Allah has 39 Earths, none of which have a Sun or Moon, the Earth lights itself. And no one knows that anyone works in Sins and this Earth of yours is the completion of the Forty (Earths)."

Then he said 'I thought there was no Earth except that Allah gave it and it was trampled over and it has no position concealed except in it is its direction from a prostrating Angel or his feet standing upright."

And from Mohammed Al Baqir that he said to Zurarah 'O Zurarah, verily Allah has a White Earth, its light is from itself, it does not have a Sun nor Moon and it has in it creatures unknown except by Allah. And they did not disobey Allah even the wink of an eye's worth."

Zurarah said "And where is Iblis?"

Imam Al Baqir said "They do not know that Allah created Iblis"

He said "May my soul be your ransom who are the sons of Adam?"

He said "They know that Allah created Adam"

And Imam Al Sadiq said "Our father Adam said 'Verily Allah created 39 Domes from the seed of Adam."

And from Humayran who said "I asked Imam Al Baqir about the Angels and their saying:

_**“Will you make in it who corrupts in it and sheds blood?"**_

(The Holy Qur'an 2:30)

He replied "And where would the Angels know to ask that except in What was before (of previous Rounds)?"

- 119 -

And from Imam Al Baqir who said "There passed upon our father, the Prince of the Believers Ali Ibn Abu Talib a man-"

So he said to him 'O Prince of the Believers what are these Lineages that people trace themselves to" So he cal ed him and said to him "Trace your lineage.’ So he said "Yes, trace my lineage to Aad and Thamud and Qarun and between them a lot."

So Imam Ali said "You do not know how to trace your lineage"

"I wil tel your lineages and I am Ali, the Seventh of the Seven Weeks of the Adamites.”

And the Prophet of Allah said 'Verily Allah has 15,000 Universes and the World has in it one Universe and in the World is 1,000 Nations other than the Jinn and Humans 600 of them are in the Seas and 400 are in the Land."

And from Al Sadiq who said "Three Cycles were 700,000 years and a Round/Turn/Cycle 70,000 years and a Cycle 7,000 years."

And from Imam Al Baqir who said "I spoke about the sons of Israel."

So a man said "May I be your ransom by Allah in the Hadiths of the Seven is what is more amazing than their Hadiths."

Imam Al Baqir said "Perhaps O Man, you seek the Haft-iya?"

The man said "Yes"

So Imam Al Baqir said "Believe in it for it is the Truth."

And from Mohammed son of Ali from the Prince of the Believers who said "Verily, after me are Tribulations, Dark, blind, problematic. Nothing remains in it except the Sleeping"

So it was said "And what is in the Sleeping?"

He said "That when people do not know what is in themselves."

And from Imam Al Baqir who said "Two are between the hands of this matter, the Eclipse of the Moon the Fifth. And an eclipse of the Sun the Fifteen that is so from the descending of Adam to the Earth and then the calculations of the astrologers will fall."

And from Yahya son of Imran who said "I heard Ali son of Hussein say 'Whoever realizes our Qaim and had a flaw is recovered from that. And whoever is sick is healed from it.”

And the son of Hussein said 'Destroyed are the sons of Al Abass at the hands of our Qaim, upon his mention be peace."

And from Yahya son of Imran who said 'I asked Abu Abdullah Ja'far about the absence of this matter, when is it and what is the sign of his absence?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "A sinking of the ground around the bounds of Nahavand (city in Iran) and at Fawat Al Hussein Aqabat Halwan, And a Tremor will hit the people of Persia, And an Earthquake will hit the people of Rome. So if you see that or hear about it then be sure about the occultation of the companion of this matter (Imam Mahdi)"

I said "Oh Master, may I be your ransom, his absence is for sure from Allah."

- 120 -

Imam Al Sadiq said: "As such he was brought out to us and his matter is to Allah, if He wills He speeds and if He wills He slows."

He said "O Master, where is his occultation at?"

Imam Al Sadiq, from him peace, said "From behind this Space of yours"

He said "O Master, there is nothing beyond this Space that surrounds our World-"

Then Imam Al Sadiq smiled and said "I shall tell you about that and will not prevent it from you Inshallah. For beyond this Space is various cities, every city has 12,000 doors, and around every door in every day and night is 12,000 men. No deputyship for them till Judgement Day"

He asked "O Master, and how many are the cities?"

Imam Al Sadiq replied "39 Domes besides the Dome of Adam (a.s.)."

He asked "O Master, from the seed of Adam?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "They do not know that Allah created Adam"

He said "And does O Master, Iblis follow them with his horses?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "They do not know that Allah created Iblis"

He said "O Master, may Allah make me your ransom, how does the Qaim, upon his mention peace, break through them?"

The Imam replied "He breaks through from wherever Allah wills and is between them."

He said "O Master, where is his occultation and in which city of these cities does he take residency?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "He lives wherever he wills and Allah is the One who grants success, for us and for you."

He said "O Master do any of you travel to them?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "Yes we are the Proofs of Allah in them and upon them and they give us the Khums of their money, and do not disobey Allah the blink of an eye's worth."

He said "O Master, and in which times do you travel to them?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "If we are here then we are also there and if we are there then we are also here."

He said "O Master, without a transport or travel?"

So Imam Al Sadiq smiled and said: “But do not alow your love for us to cause you to say other than the truth. We are the Glorified Servants of Allah, we do not speak before Him and we work by His command. And we fear Him with the unseen and we are in Awe of Him, Glory to Him for He has not given us all these goods except by praise. And we are the

- 121 -

Storages of His Knowledge and the Placement of His Secrets and the Safeguards of His Knowledge.

And the Inheritor of His Prophets and Messengers and Veils upon His servants from His creation. Allah chose us, we do not prescribe for ourselves harm nor benefit except with that He wills. Verily what I described to you was with the Power of our Lord"

He asked "O Master, may Allah make me your ransom, from where is the coming out of your Qaim from?"

Imam Al Sadiq replied "From the House of God the Sanctified, and the first to shake his hand pledging allegiance is Gabriel amongst 70,000 Angels and no Angel remains in the sky except that it has pledged allegiance to him."

He said "O Master, I have something which your Glory prevents me from asking about"

Imam Al Sadiq replied "Allah have mercy on you, our Lord commanded us to teach you all that you need."

"So ask about whatever came to mind."

He said "O Master, since when did Allah create the World and how long is its beginning till its extinction?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "50,000 Rounds and every Round is 400,000 Cycles and every Cycle is 400,000 Years"

He said "O Master, may Allah sacrifice myself for you, this matter does not end?"

"The Knowledge of that is with Allah, He sees the Hour near and we see it far away"

He said "O Master, where is Heaven?"

The Imam said "Here."

I said "O Master in the World?"

The Imam said "Yes"

I said to him "And where is the Fire?"

The Imam said "Wherever Allah wills."

I said "O Master, Paradise is in the Earth?"

He said "Yes, verily Allah said:

_**They will say: "Praise be to Allah, Who has truly fulfilled His Promise to us, and has**_

_**given us (this) land in heritage: We can dwell in Paradise as we will. How excellent a**_

_**reward for those who work (righteousness)"**_

(The Holy Qur'an 39:74)

He said "O Master is there an end to Heaven and Hell and a time limit?"

The Imam from him peace said "Yes because Allah said in the story of Heaven and Hell:

- 122 -

_**"They will dwell therein for all the time that the heavens and the earth endure, except**_

_**as thy Lord willeth."**_

(The Holy Qur'an 11:108)

He said "O Master, to where is the destiny of the people of Heaven and the Fire?"

The Imam from him peace said "The inhabitants of the Fire become Straws."

I said "O Master, what is the Straws?"

The Imam said "Bugs and Flies and Ants and the likes of that."

He said "O Master, they transfer from thing to thing?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "Yes, and they transfer from creation to creation, for that is the Greater Punishment."

He said "O Master, what do the people of Paradise become?"

The Imam replied "Angels"

I said "Exactly?

He said "They become Spiritual Beings"

I asked "O Master, they do not transfer from thing to thing?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "No"

I said "O Master, what do the Adamite females and the Houris become and where is the inhabitation of the people of Paradise?"

The Imam said "Allah speaks to each Believer a Paradise according to his limit and takes for him in it Castles and the Adamite females and the Houris go to their Husbands."

He said "O Master and where does He take for them theParadise in the Earth and in what position?"

He said "O Master and where does He take for them the Paradise in the Earth and in what position?"

The Imam replied "Between the Pillars of the Chair"

He said "O Master, and where are the pillars of the Chair?"

Imam Al Sadiq replied "The chair in length is one thousand thousand pillars, and between each pillar and pillar is the distance of one thousand thousand years, as such its width.

And for them from Allah in every stop is Seventy Thousand Visitors.

And everytime they visit him and return to their homes and they have increased Seventy told the likes that they were given before"

I said "O Master, verily this is the Generous Preference and are they in these Paradises better in livelihood or in this first Paradise?"

So Imam Al Sadiq smiled from him peace and then said:

- 123 -

"O Bashar, rather the First Paradises beside Allah are better than the Second Paradise. Did you not know that Allah trades between them in the first Paradises because of His nearness and closeness so He chose with them from His sight.”

He said "O Master, the Adamite females transfer from condition to condition?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "Yes O Bashar, they transfer from sex to sex and from goodness to goodness and from light to light and from blessing to the best of blessings."

He said "O Master, all praises to Allah that has not given from His knowledge to anyone but you, He specialized you by His Preference without all of His creation."

Imam al Sadiq said "O Bashar, may Allah have mercy on you, do not tell the secret that I have given you from the secret of Allah alone."

Then Imam Al Sadiq said "The matter of the Qaim and his rise is to Allah alone"

I said "O Master, does he not have signs?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "Rather he has various signs"

I said "What are they O Master?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "A fire reaching from here" and he pointed his hand towards the Qibla and to the East"

I said "O Master, all this in one night?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "Yes and there is a Maskh in India and Sind"

"And Al Hussein enters Halwan"

I said "O Master, to what destination does he seek?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "He seeks a modern city, on the beach of Al Basra"

I said "O Master is it not Al Zawra (Baghdad)?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "No"

I said "O Master then what happens?"

He said "The coming down of soldiers on the Beach of Sihan of Basra.

And there comes out on the beach of the Tigris River from Al Basra a man from the sons of my father peace be upon him.

He wants to enter in but he is prevented from that by the most severe of preventions.

And he returns leaving from it and he simmered for it the Armies from Bani Mardas.

And between him and them are many incidents and will remain as such by Allah until there is killed on his hand around Sixty Thousand"

I said "O Master then what happens?"

Imam Al Sadiq from him peace said "They remain as such until he enters it and kills its agent and the agent of Bani Mardas.

- 124 -

So he stays in it however Allah wills then its inhabitants pledge their allegiance to him in hate without obedience and they give him the Tenth.

So if he is assured and grasps, they betray him and break into his house at night and kill his companions and raid their homes.

And he rids himself and flees from his companions and its inhabitants and goes out escaping from it.

And his companions Bani Mardas raise one of their heads on a channel and claim that they killed him.

And if you see a fourth of his head on a couch/bed or with hands then do not believe in his killing, for he left escaping from it by Allah.

And he is delivered with his head and he goes until he reaches Yemen, and the people gather to him from the tribes of the Arabs and the devoted are peoples that are great in character.

Then he goes out with them until he reaches your Kufa and he stays in it God willing and a people from Kufa gather to him and he leaves it until he reaches Al Basra.

So he wins it by night and enters it and he kills from it many creatures and he burns with it many tribes then he returns to Kufa."

Bashar said "O Master, then after that what happens?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "What happens is whatever Allah wants"

He said "O Master, may I be your ransom, hurry with the answer, I have not asked except desiring that."

Imam Al Sadiq said "Know that one of our followers still remains in Kufa giving life to its outlying areas and spends it in his companions. And he taked out his Fifth (Khums) and pushes it to his family"

He said "O Master, where is the companion of this command that day during his occultation?"

Imam Al Sadiq replied "Wherever Allah wills."

I said "O Master, it has been narrated to us from your father Imam Mohammed Al Baqir that the companion of this matter's occultation is in some your descendants."

Imam Al Sadiq smiled and then said "My father has told the truth, verily the companion of this matter is from behind this Space surrounded by Knowledge in Land and Sea."

Then Imam Al Sadiq said "Rather in various cities"

He said "O Master, what do we do with that which has been narrated from your father?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "Know you and your brothers that the Stations/Ranks of men with us are decided upon how much they can handle about us. The friend of Allah, Abraham said 'I am impotent' but why impotent? Do you see him as a liar?"

Nay by Allah but rather he was truthful and He knows best what he said, may peace and blessings be upon him"

Then he said "O Master, in those cities are from the sons of Adam?"

The Imam said "They don't know that Allah created Adam"

I said "O Master, does Iblis make them do wrong?"

- 125 -

The Imam said "They don't know that Allah created Iblis"

Bashar said "O Master do they know you Truly?"

"Yes, they come to us with fruits out of its season and they give us their Khums (Fifth) that Allah made incumbent and a duty for us in His book. And they are more adhering to us than you"

He said "O Master, do they have intercourse and give birth?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "Yes, like Adam and Eve"

He said "O Master, Allah sent them Messengers as He sent them to the sons of Adam?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "Yes, He sent the Messengers to all of creation and to all who are without the Throne and all that He created" He said "O Master, and they decided upon your Authority"

Imam Al Sadiq said "Whoever denies one of us then he is to us and no Vicegerent did they deny and they do not deny us for we are the light house of Allah in His land then His trustees upon His creation"

I said "All praises due to Allah who let me know the extremities of your preference"

Imam Al Sadiq from him peace said "May Allah have mercy on you, Allah has not made known to anyone the extremities of our preference except the worth of a White hair in a Black Bull. As for the worth of our preference and knowledge in the knowledge of Allah and His preference is not but the worth of what a bird carries with its beak from the sea that Allah mentioned in His book."

He said "O Master, all praises to Allah that has no similar to Him, there is no God but Allah that has no description to Him nor attribute."

Then Imam Al Sadiq said "Our Lord was before the directions and is the Creator of the directions. And He is the after and He is the Creator of the after and the destination of every destination. And He is the Beginner of everything and its Creator and the Beginning of Beginning and the Everlasting of the End"

Then Imam Al Sadiq glued his cheek to the ground and by Allah I heard him say this:

"My Lord and Aide, and Master and Support and Creator and Sustainer, and if He wills He tortures me so He forbids me and if He wills He has mercy on me by His Grace, woe that day to the ones who belief!"

Then Imam Al Sadiq turned his cheek on the dust while saying: "I am your Servant and the son of your Servant and the Grandson of your Servant and the son of your nation I have become poor to your Mercy"

"I am pledged to it, O my God, have mercy on my faults and poverty and have mercy on my neediness O Master by Victory over my enemies for without Your Victory, I shall be one of the lovers"

Then Imam Al Sadiq raised his head and said something that was not audible.

So he said "I'm at your command my Master"

- 126 -

Imam Al Sadiq "Safeguard what we have revealed to you from the Knowledge of Allah that He safeguarded From His Angels"

He said "O Master, when will this cover be revealed?"

So the Imam cried until his tears ran and then said "O Robiee, God willing that has the Ability and Power with creation and the matter Inshallah is upon the Trusted and Trustworthy"

And from Abu Abdullah who said "When the Prophet of Allah Mohammed approached death he said:

"O Ali if I die then wash me and embalm me and clothe me and sit me and I shall tell you what will happen till Judgement Day"

"So when he died Ali washed him and embalmed him and clothed him then sat him so Mohammed told him what would happen till Judgement Day."

_**tensely cold**_

_**A fitting recompense (for them)."**_

(The Holy Qur'an 78:23-26)

Imam Al Sadiq said "(They stay in Hell) In proportion to their evil works and the news in the Round and that is Allah's words:

_**“Everything (that exists) wil perish except His own Face."**_

(The Holy Qur'an 28:88)

"And the Fire is the Fastest of the two Houses to respond to Allah's words:

_**"They will dwell therein for all the time that the heavens and the earth endure, except**_

_**as thy Lord willeth: for thy Lord is the (sure) accomplisher of what He planneth."**_

(The Holy Qur'an 11:107)

And when the people of Punishment came out, they became 3 Groups. One Group returned to a House of Greater Punishment, those are the ones who are in there forever. And a group returned to the House of Decay. And a Group became like Straws, moving in the image of a worm and that is Allah's words:

_**"Further, make him march in a chain, whereof the length is seventy cubits!**_

_**This was he that would not believe in Allah Most Great."**_

(The Holy Qur'an 69:32-33)

"He says March forth in Torment in Seventy Creation images and Allah said:

_**"When behold, they will be in the (always) awake."**_

(The Holy Qur'an 79:14)

He is saying there is a worm what stays awake and does not sleep and does not marry and nothing of creation is in it, neither offspring nor eggs. Then Allah said:

_**"Then do we return him (to be) the lowest of the low."**_

(The Holy Qur'an 95:5)

"Allah says in a Worm that has no lineage and no offspring and nothing of Creation is more Evil than it nor more Despicable than it. For if it was Resurrection Day or the Day of Resurrection of Mohammed the Straws (worms) will fade then the people of Reward will come out of the Four Rounds and Become Three Groups:

A Group returns to the Best of Rewards and that is the Fardous Paradise and it is the Paradise of Immortality!

- 105 -

A Group returns to the House of Refinement/Filtration

And a Group to the Crops of the Birds and the Stomachs of the Fish

Then it is (Naskh) duplicated Seventy times then it fades away in the Greater Gathering.

And the Straws are 7 Species of Bird and Fish and Beast and Lion and Vermin and Stone and Plant. And 70 Kinds of Fish and 70 Kinds of Wild Beasts and Domestic and Seventy Kinds of Wild and Domestic Lions and that's Allah's words:

_**"There is not an animal (that lives) on the earth, nor a being that flies on its wings, but**_

_**are nations like you."**_

(The Holy Qur'an 6:38)

"So the best of the Beasts and the tastiest meat and milk are what are the most in numbers and the Best of Birds what have Crops and Gizzards. And the Best and Sweetest of Fish Meat are what have scales. For what was of it like that is Naskh (Duplication or Transmigration of Soul from same kind to same kind) and what is other than that is Maskh.

And what was of the Straws in the Womb, they have tails and what is in the Eggs, also he has a tail and what is in the Womb Breast Feeds and what is in the Eggs feeds and gathers.

And what is Naskh is good to eat and what is Maskh is Haram to eat and his self lessens and his injuries like the lions of Beasts then Birds.

And the Vermins are actually a Maskh that turns into a Jewel that they carried with them.

And the Pearl and Ruby and the Precious Stones/Gems are Naskh and the Iron and Copper and Lead are Maskh and that is what Allah reported in His book:

_**"There is not a thing but celebrates His praise: And yet ye understand not how they**_

_**declare His glory! Verily He is often Forbearing, Most Forgiving!"**_

(The Holy Qur'an 17:44)

_**“**_ And Allah said:

_**Say: "(Nay!) be ye stones or iron Or created matter which, in your minds, is hardest (to**_

_**be raised up). Then will they say: 'Who will cause us to return?"**_

_**Say: "He who created you the First time!" Then will they wag their heads towards thee,**_

_**and say, 'When wil that be?’ Say, 'maybe it wil be quite soon!"**_

(The Holy Qur'an 17:51)

Imam Al Sadiq continued "And Allah said

_**'Do they not look at Allah's creation, (even) among (inanimate) things.-How their (very)**_

_**shadows turn round, from the right and the left, prostrating themselves to Allah, and**_

_**that in the humblest manner?"**_ (The Holy Qur'an 16:48)

"And Imam Al Sadiq said

_**"Al ah said 'Each one knows its own (mode of) prayer and praise.”**_

(The Holy Qur'an 24:41)

For that is the Detail in the matter of the Rounds and Peace."

**"In Knowing the Characteristics and Corners and Slats"**

Imam Ja'far Al Sadiq said "Understand (may) Allah make you Firm upon the Stable Speech.

Verily Allah Spread out His Light. Then He created from it a Slat and Image. Then He commanded it to cut into images and strips. So they came forth images and strips on the spread out Light then they Worshipped Allah and did not Disobey Him.

Then He commanded that Spread out Fire be created. And He commanded him to cut from it strips and that Changed Birds com forth from it.

So they came forth to Allah worshippers.

So the Light-ed prepared to mix in the Fiery so some of them mixed.

So He spread out a Creation from two Creations then He commanded him that Wind be created.

So it was created then He commanded that Strips be cut from it and He pictured from it Images and they came forth to Allah worshippers. And He commanded the Fiery not to mix in the Windy and some of it mixed.

So He spread out the land that was mixed.

So He commanded him to create Water so it was created and He fashioned Images from it and cut from it Strips.

So He commanded the Windy not to mix in the Watery. And they mixed.

Then He created Mud from the two Seas, the Pure and the Salty then He commanded him to cut strips from it and he fashioned images from it.

And He commanded the Watery not to mix with the Muddy and some of them mixed.

So Spread forth from it came what was the beginning of the Creation that was combined of Four: Light, Fire, Wind and Water.

And Spread out from that was the Mud of Adam then He created the matter of the Here after so the Traits were installed.

And of a thing, half is created high and the other half is created Low from the Rock and he troubled it with the decision of the two lands.

Because it’s Surface is on a Whale

And the Whale became on Water

And the Water became on the Rock

And the Rock is White and it is on Air

What is between the Air to the Rock and the Jinn are there,Motionless Vehicles of the Layer.

Then He created Adam and made him habitate the back of it and He commanded him and forbid him and made his reward in the commanding and forbidding in the World and Afterlife.

And in what is on the back of the Layer of what Allah ran upon it and upon its seed and from it its food and drink and sleep and seeking marriage partners.

Then He opened for them in it of its Lusts and Adornments and Playfulness then Allah said in His Great Book:

_**"Wealth and sons are allurements of the life of this world: But the thing that endure,**_

_**good deeds, are best in the sight of thy Lord. But the things that endure, good deeds,**_

_**are best in the sight of thy Lord, as rewards, and best as (the foundation for) hopes."**_

(The Holy Qur'an 18:46)

"For the things that endure of good deeds is commanding good and what they do to Obey Him. And the installation of his frame of mind in its adornments and falsehoods and marriage partners and its money and Allah said:

- 107 -

_**"O ye who believe! Truly, among your wives and your children are enemies to**_

_**yourselves: so beware of them!"**_

(The Holy Qur'an 64:14)

Then Allah said:

_**"Your riches and your children are but a trial; but in the Presence of Allah, is the**_

_**highest, Reward."**_

(The Holy Qur'an 64:15)

And their desire for things which endure/last and He made what perishes as a Trial for them and their command is to beware of them.

As for that which they were forbidden from there came to them the Punishments and Trials and Tribulations from the kinds of bad health and Shortings in Sons and Selves And when they did not do what they were commanded with from the Obedience of Allah, there came to them of the Punishment that He promised them with of Maskh and Lowliness And Allah said in the Seed of who came forth from the sons of Adam. For He destroyed them with the Punishment of the World and with the Punishment of the Afterlife and of them were those taken by the flood. And of them were those taken by the trembling and of them are those who went into Maskh as Monkeys and Pigs and the likes of that of the Torture of the Afterlife.

Then Allah said:

_**'And indeed We will make them taste of the lower Penalty prior to the supreme**_

_**Penalty, in order that they may return.'**_

(The Holy Qur'an 32:21)

-meaning they stop doing what they were forbidden. And Allah said:

_**'If ye are grateful, I will add more (favours) unto you; But if ye show ingratitude, truly**_

_**My punishment is terrible indeed."**_

(The Holy Qur'an 14:7)

Allah says:

_**'If you are thankful I will add more'**_ (The Holy Qur'an 14:7) Meaning increases in the rewards of the world and Afterlife in money and progeny and living.

And Noah had said 'Seek forgiveness from your Lord, He is often Forgiving, He sends the Sky upon you in Abundance and He supports you with moneyand offspring and He makes for you Gardens and makes for you Rivers.

Allah says:

_**'Sooner and later so Glorify Him sooner and later, He that made in it a Listener in**_

_**another Will"**_

They have Veils and Messengers that tell them about their Lord in proportion to what they stopped that they were forbidden. So when they turned from their Messengers, He made their End the same as their Beginning. Then they turned to Him such a turn for Allah said:

_**"And behold! ye come to us bare and alone as We created you for the first time."**_

(The Holy Qur'an 6:94)

_**"And you have known the first creation, so will you not remember?"**_

(The Holy Qur'an 56:62)

- 108 -

_**“Is not He who created the heavens and the earth Able to create the likes of them?**_

_**Yes, (it is so); and He is the Knowing Creator.The command is only when He intends a**_

_**thing that He says to it, "Be," and it is. So exalted is He in whose hand is the realm of**_

_**all things, and to Him you will be returned."**_

(The Holy Qur'an 36:81-83)

For the Realm is the Realm of the Path and the First Strips and everyone's Strip is a Path and a Realm in the Knowing, the Old. Allah is much Higher than what the wrongful say and claim to Him is praise always and forever and upon Him the Believers should trust their affairs."

**"In Knowing the Individual and his Self with Four Characters and Four Pillars and Four** **Corners"**

Imam Al Sadiq said "In explaining that, the Characteristics of a person are: the Black and the Yellow and the Mucus and the Blood and the Corners of Light and Fire and Wind and Water and a Mud/Clay Image. He looks in Light and eats and drinks with Fire and he gathers and moves and finds taste and food by Water. For that is a Door from his Image for if these Corners descend in a Self it was nine seeking and finding the beginning of its creation is his mind. And that is his Guide and his Sight and his Way and his Key and with it he completes what he was sent down with"

For if the support of his mind was of Light he was a Knower, Memorized, Intelligent, Understands, Clairvoyant. He knows about that from his maturity and glory and how and why. For when he benefited others he knew its direction/path and its connection and disconnection. So by that he would have realized Mortality and he lives immortally by Devotion to Monotheism.

And the Arts are by Obediance so if he does that he realizes what has passed and he increased in what he is upon. And upon that he comes and knows what he is in and from what thing he is here and to what he is going to be. And he does not find Yellow except in Yellow nor Red except in Red nor Black except in Black and no Whiteness except in Whiteness. And he does not find except a Smell or Sweetness or Sourness or Acidy or Salty.

For if he knows the Red without Red and the Yellow without the Yellow and the White without the White and the Black without the Black.

Then that is the completion of his Knowing. How does he renew the illusion and his illusion is not except by the support of his mind. And it might be that the self runs in him while it is hot then it runs through him while he is cold. So if the Hot came upon him he is Joyful and Vain and Rested and Delighted and Glad and he commits Adultery and Fornicates and is Shaken and Happy. And if the Cold came upon him he is Griefed and Saddened and Lowered and Humiliated and Forgetful and Hopeless. For it is the symptoms that from it are ill health. And its course is food and drink in Hours and that are not Agreeable Hours for that drink and food. So he endures the pains from the colors and the ill health...and Peace."

**"In Knowing what Allah created and cut into Strips"**

Imam Al Sadiq said "Verily, Allah cut the Strips and fashioned the images and He created the Light.

Then He Veiled the Fire with the Wind.

Then He created the Water and Veiled the Water with the Wind.

And He created the Mud from the Foam of the Sea so the Water was veiled by it.

And from the Light the Angels were created in image.

And from the Fire was created the Jinn in image.

And Mud is the image of Adam and Adam was created from Mud and the Fire and the Wind and the Water and that is the affair of the world.

And He created the Light from the affair of the Afterlife.

And the Wind from the affair of the Afterlife

And that is because of Allah's saying:

_**"There are among us some that are righteous, and some the contrary: we follow**_

_**divergent paths."**_

(The Holy Qur'an 72:11)

Allah says _**'Compose a Jewel created from a Jewel and cut from it images from you,**_

_**from your Jewel’**_ then the Angels became, seeing all the Creations and the Creatures from Creation do not see them except the Jinn. Because they were created from Fire and that is Allah's saying:

_**"And the Jinn race, We had created before, from the fire of a scorching wind."**_

(The Holy Qur'an 15:27)

And no one from the Jinn or Men see them except who Allah has honoured. Rather the people see them in the Jewel of Light that was described. So the human became, eating and drinking with Fire. And looking and learning with Light. And hearing and smelling with Wind.

And he finds the tastiness of the food with Water. And he moves by the Wind. For if it wasn't that the Fire is in his Stomach, the condition of food and drink in his Stomach would not be digested.

And if it wasn't for the Wind, the Fire of the Stomach would not be ignited nor would the weight in his Stomach leave him nor the coldness of the Water.

And if it wasn't for the Light, his Sight would not see"

And if it wasn't for the Soul/Spirit, he would not have come nor gone for Mud is his image and the Bones in his Body are at the Rank of the Trees and the Earth/Land.

And the Blood in his Body is at the rank of Water in the Land/Earth.

And there is nothing to support/raise the Earth/Land except by Water.

And there is no support/lift for the Body of the Human except with Blood and the Hair on his Body is like the plants on the face of the Earth"

And the Brain is the Sediment of the Blood and its foam/butter.

As such was the Human created from the affair of the World and Afterlife.

For if Allah gathers between them, his life becomes in the Earth because it came down from the Sky to the World from the affair of the Afterlife.

So if Allah splits/distinguishes between them, that split becomes by Death because his Spirit came down to the Earth from the affair of the Afterlife.

For life is with the Earth and Death is in the Sky and that is because He distinguishes between the Spirit and Body so long that it is from the affair of the World.

- 111 -

And if he dies then his Soul is returned and the Light and Fire to the First Strip and he leaves the Body in the World.

Because the Wind Dries and Stiffens the Mud so he becomes Remnants and everything returns to its Jewel that it was created from.

Then the Spirit moves by the Self and the Self's movement is from the Spirit/Soul, so what was from the Self of the Believer is from Light, hot clongated by the Mind.

And what is from the Self of the Disbeliever is Cold clongated by Fire.

For the Believer's image is Light and the Disbeliever's image is Fire and the movement in them is from the Spirit/Soul. So what is moved by Light and the Spirit/Soul is from its Right.

And what is moved by Fire is his Left. And that is Allah's words:

_**"Then he that will be given his Record in his right"**_

(The Holy Qur'an 69:19)

For he reads it and for the one receives his book with his Left, he will not read it well and Death is a mercy from Allah towards his Believing Servant.

And it is Revenge from Allah towards the Disbeliever and if Allah wills that He brings His Believing Servant out of the World to the Afterlife then He had mercy on him and forgave him. And He brings him out of his prison and invites him to His mercy and returns to His Light because the World is a prison of the Believer.

And it (the world) is a Paradise for the Disbeliever and if Allah wills Shame for the Disbeliever He vanishes his Self (Nafs) and ruined his power.

Then He brings him out of his paradise and returns his Self to the Fire and for Allah are two punishments in this World. One of them is from the Spirit/Soul in the torment of the Afterlife and the other is from setting each other against one another for Allah said:

_**"Then do we make the wrong-doers turn to each other, because of what they earn."**_ –

(The Holy Qur'an 6:129)

Of sins, for what it was of that for each is a punishment for the Soul and verily that is Disease/Sickness and Poverty. And all that is made as a Punishment for the Believer and an indignation for the Disbelievers, and the worse torture in the afterlife and revenge in the World. And there is no Indignation upon the Believer in this World nor Punishment in the Afterlife and that is not so except by a sin. And the Sin is from Desire so what is from that from the Believer is a mistake and forgetfulness. And what is from the Disbeliever is Deliberate and Ingratitude and Violation and Envy and that is Allah's words:

_**"Throw, throw into Hell every contumacious Rejecter (of Allah) from selfish envy, after**_

_**the Truth hath become Manifest unto them"**_

(The Holy Qur'an 50:24 & 2:109)

And the first creation to worship Allah was the Angels and their image is from Light and they do not infringe or outpace or leave what they were commanded with, obediant to Allah in the Covenant He took upon them.

And the Promise and Safeguard and they did not change nor trade anything from which they were commanded, they know there is no God but Allah.

So when He created the Jinn they entired one another so He clouded them and He mixed them so the ones who do not perform the works of the Angel do not see them. And that was made a Veil between them for the Veils are Seven:

A Veil between the Individual and the Soul/Spirit

A Veil between the Soul/Spirit and the Angels

And a Veil between the Angels and the Jinn

And a Veil between the Jinn and Humans

- 112 -

For the first to believe in the construction of the Earth were the Jinn but they committed abominations in it with Corruption and Bloodshed. And they forgot the Promise and Covenant and Trusteeship and they remained in the Earth then they perished and that is Allah's words:

_**"I (Allah) will create a vicegerent on earth." They (The Angels) said 'Wilt Thou place**_

_**therein one who will make mischief therein and shed blood?"**_

_**“Shed blood?-whilst we do celebrate Thy praises and glorify Thy holy (name)?" He**_

_**said: "I know what ye know not."**_

(The Holy Qur'an 2:30)

And He taught Adam the names of all things. So He created Adam and taught him the names and the number of years and math/calculation. Then He brought Adam down to Earth and commanded the Celestial Objects to rotate (i.e. Planets and such). And in the time of the Jinn the Celestial Ojects did not orbit/rotate. So he remained along with his Seed in the Territory of Territories, cutout from the calculations of the Arabs and Persians and Romans.

And the sum of the calculations of India and to the territories of the calculations of India and they are Eight. Seven of them rotate/spin and One does not move, that is the territory of the Jinn.

So he made in the Orbits Seven Territories rotating by the Tugging.So because of that Day and Night were Known.

Then He made with it Twelve Constellations, and from that the Year and Months are Known then you know the Months because the Sun rises in each Constellation for Thirty Days.

And He made the Day like the Year because He made for the Day Twelve Hours so the Hours were made like the Months.

And the Night became, not counted from the life of the human for Sleep is the brother of Death and by it is proof that the Dead are brought to Life for the Sleeping Awaken.

And rather the Death is known from Sleep and Resurrection from Life after Death from Waking.

And the creation of the person is known from his Characteristics from the Rotation of the Orbits and the Rising of the Constellations/Zodiac.

And what is in it of the Rotating and the Moving Sweeping. And if the Rotating/Spinning stops, it is then that Night will not be known from Day nor Day from Night and the Earth shall be made perfect by the Power of Al ah who has the Creations and the Command.”

**"In Knowing what Came in the Correction of the Seven Adamites"**

Mufaddal said to Imam Al Sadiq "I have heard some things from the Shia that my heart is not strong upon."

Imam Al Sadiq said "Tell me about some of what you heard from them, will you mention something". Then Imam Al Sadiq said "You wanted, O Mufaddal, to say that they say that there were Seven Adams in the Earth before Allah created Adam."

Mufaddal said "Yes, O Master, verily that's of their speech."

The Imam said "They have spoken the Truth, because there were Seven Adamites in the Earth before Allah created Adam. And Verily Gabriel was from the First Century. And Michael was from the Second Century. And Verily the Turn is 50,000 Years.

For if Allah began with creating the Adamites He would keep them in Paradise for 50,000

years. For if Allah began to create Adam He would make the inhabitants of Paradise Angels.

And He makes the inhabitants of Hell in another place. Then He created the Ademites and we were the first sent to that creation (as) Veils. And Mohammed ibn Nusayr narrated from Jacob ibn Salem' A man asked Imam Al Sadiq while I was there about this Verse:

_**"Those who are wretched shall be in the Fire: There will be for them therein (nothing**_

_**but) the heaving of sighs and sobs. They will dwell therein for all the time that the**_

_**heavens and the earth endure, except as thy Lord willeth. For thy Lord is the (sure)**_

_**accomplisher of what He planneth. And those who are blessed shall be in the Garden:**_

_**They will dwell therein for all the time that the heavens and the earth endure, except**_

_**thy Lord willeth giving without break."**_

(The Holy Qur'an 11:106-108)

So he said 'It means not forbidden' then he said 'O so and so, perhaps you are looking for the Hadith of the Haft?"

Mufaddal said "O Master, what is the Hadith of the Haft?"

"He said "There was in the Earth Seven Adamites before your Father Adam and all of them lived in the Earth and the Judgements have come upon them and they were judged and they entered Heaven and Hell. Then they were brought out of it."

Mufaddal said "May I be your ransom, where are the Believers?"

The Imam said "As for the Believers they catch up in the Angels."

Mufaddal said "What about the inhabitants of Hell?"

The Imam replied "They catch up in the Maskh, did you not read Allah's book when Allah said:

_**"It is not a warning to such men (to call to mind) how many generations before them**_

_**We destroyed, in whose haunts they (now) move?"**_

(The Holy Qu'ran 20-128)

Those are the Straws that you see the pig and the bear and the dog and the jackal and the weasel. And from Al Hassan ibn Ali Abi Al Hamza from his father from Abi Baseer narrates that:

"We were sitting at the father of Ja'far, Imam Al Baqir upon us peace from him, and they (Abu Bakr and Umar) were mentioned."

"Imam Al Baqir (father of Imam Al Sadiq) said "Upon them (Abu Bakr and Umar) is the Curse of Allah. They are Mislead and Misleading. And by Allah still in the First Centuries in the beginning first when Allah sent Adam on the face of the Earth. For Allah had sent Seven Adamites before Adam and they were in those past nations and centuries until Allah sent Mohammed; and he did what we described and have taught you and told you of, for that is what Allah wanted for those two until He sends the Qaim. So he brings them out nourished and flexible and then he burns them.

By Allah the Trial of the people because of those two in those Days will be Greater than the Trials of the people because of them today.Then he blows them up and away with the Wind.

Then Allah switches the Sky with another Sky, and the Earth with another Earth, it is then the Earth will stand upright to us."

From the son of Abdullah Al Barqi from the son of Omar from the son of Khalid son of Salem who said "We are sitting at Imam Ja'far Al Sadiq's And we mentioned a man. So he said "I do not know him". They said "Verily a man realized the ways of Khurasan seven times flourishing."

The Imam from him peace said "So how many times do you think he realized it in losses/ruins?"

And Imam Al Sadiq asked those present about the World, he said 'It is 400 Rounds and the Round is 400,000 years and in every round are Seven Adamites and in every round is Adam

And Noah

And Abraham

And Moses

And Jesus son of Mary

And Mohammed peace be upon them al .”

And from Mohammed son of Ismail about the Beginning he said: "I walked in on my father and said to him: "May my soul be ransomed for you, was there an Adam before our Adam?"

He replied "Verily the World was created then close to the days of the Beginning before your Adam there were other Adamites. Did you not read Allah's words?

_**"We have decreed Death to be your common lot, and We are not to be frustrated"**_

(The Holy Qur'an 56:60)

Power that arose an upbringing that no one knows but Allah."

"So Mohammed son of Ismail said "Every Adam, O Master, has in his turn a Mohammed and Ali and Fatima and Hassan and Hussein And Abu Bakr and Umar and Uthman and you the Imams particularly or are they names that match?"

Imam Al Sadiq replied "It is us precisely and our grandfather Mohammed precisely and Ali and Fatimah and Hassan and Hussein precisely. And Abu Bakr and Umar and Uthman precisely" then Imam Al Sadiq turned and said:

"Verily from us are the Messengers of Allah so long that Allah's creation is in need."

- 115 -

Mercy and Getting along being in one Line, and the gathering of one word and the Obediance to Allah and His Prophet and those entrusted with affairs. Is a truth in accordance with Allah's words:

_**"O You who believe, obey Allah and the Prophet and those entrusted with the affairs**_

_**from you"**_

(The Holy Qur'an 4:59)

And if Allah begins to destroy them, He raises us to Him. And if He begins to create another creation, we are the Messengers to them."

Then Mufaddal said "O Master, Verily Salman owns in every Round 4,000 years."

And Mufaddal said "I asked Abu Abdullah (Imam Sadiq) and said 'Is there, O Master, another World with our World?"

So he (sawas) replied 'O Mufaddal, there has been created like this Dome of yours 12,000

Domes.

If you took this Dome of yours and placed it in between a Dome of those it would not show in it. And for every Dome is 12,000 Doors. And the length of every Hemistitch of it is 12,000

years and in it are lines, standing on their feet such that if you threw a needle it would fall on one of their heads undoubtedly. They praise Allah and Venerate Him and inform so and so in their praises."

Mufaddal said "O Master, are those from the seed of Adam?"

The Imam said "They do not know Adam nor his seed."

Mufaddal said "They know you, the Imams O Master"

Imam Al Sadiq said "We are known better by them than by you"

Mufaddal asked Imam Al Sadiq "What do the Believers become if they complete/finish?"

He said from him peace "Angels close in the company of the Merciful, He speaks to them and they speak to Him and He is disclosed to them after the Spirit of the Heavens."

Mufaddal said "O Master, where is the destination of the cursed?"

The Imam from him peace said "They are in Maskh like the Pests, Snakes and Scorpions."

And from Ibn Sinan from Khrash Al Nahry from Zurarah who said "One day I was at the father of Ja'far, Imam Ali Baqir's from him peace. He said to me 'O Zurarah, do you not have anything from the Hadith of the Seven Greats/Elders?"

Zurarah said "Indeed, O Master, may my soul be ransomed for you, but it is in my Self by Allah that speaks to me to ask you."

So Al Baqir said to me "Your request O Zurarah about the Seven Adamites. For before our father Adam, peace be upon him, there were six Adamites that have already had their Judgements and they were accounted for and placed in Heaven and Hell O Zurarah. The Angels did not know when they said:

_**'Will you make it who shall corrupt in it and shed blood. Were it not for that was**_

_**deemed from the Great Ancient Matter/Command."**_

(The Holy Qur'an 2:30)

- 116 -

And from Imam Al Sadiq who said "If Allah places his Preferred in Heaven and his enemies in the Fire, they become whatever Allah wills. For if Allah loves to bring them back, He makes the inhabitants of Heaven into Spiritual Angels, and we are His Messengers to His creation."

Imam Ja'far Sadiq said "In the Mighty Qur'an, there are seven verses of different possibilities for Moses' speech to Pharaoh. Each Adam (Mankind) had a Moses and Pharaoh, so six before that Allah will do with them whatever He Wills and the Seventh is our Adam's, the one whom Allah will cause to live forever."

From Ali son of Yousef from Ibrahim son of Hesham from Ismael son of Abdul Aziz who said

'I said to Imam Al Sadiq: "May my soul be ransom for you, was there an Adam before our father Adam?"

"He (Imam Al Sadiq) from him peace said "Yes Adam before Adam until he counted to 21

Adams and to each one his age and the age of his offspring in the World and Heaven and the Fire for 50,000 years then the inhabitants of Heaven became Angels and the inhabitants of the Fire/Hell become Straws"

Ibrahim said that Ismail ibn Abdul Aziz said "I asked Imam Al Sadiq from him peace and said

'May I be your ransom, my aim is the Haft-iya"

He, from him peace, said "Yes, Allah says Seven Skies and Seven Earths alike and in every Earth is Adam and Noah like your Noah"

Safwan son of Safwan son of Yahya from Imam Al Hussein from him peace "He had with him two men and he said to one of them: "Tell so and so about what you heard and what I told you about yesterday. He said there were before us Seven Adamites that lived and their children and they completed their sustenance and they were judged and they entered Heaven and the Fire/Hell. But it was too much in the man's heart" So he said to him "There is Al Hussain, so ask him for I have not lied to you."

So Hussein said 'Verily the Judgement day goes upon them then they enter Heaven and the Fire/Hell. Then the Earth returns without anyone in it worshipping Him. From Mohammed ibn Sinan from Mohammed son of Alhay alkhuthiy from Kathir Anlnoway who said 'I said to him:

"Woe to you O Kathir, how great are your differences about the father of Ja'far?"

He said 'I heard something not loved ever"

He said 'I said to him "Woe to you, what did you hear from him?"

He said 'I heard him say that all the Adamites were begun/opened with Mohammed and his Family."

And from Mohammed son of Ismail from Abi Hamza Al Shamali who said 'I said to Abu Abdullah from him peace:

"May Allah make me your ransom, tell me O Master about the saying of Allah that everything will face except His face, and to Him is praise"

He said 'O so and so, everything will fade and nothing will remain except the face of Allah and He is Greater than to be described with a description. But the meaning is everything is fading except His religion and we, the Imams are the face of Allah that nothing is given except from it. We still remain in the Worshippers/Servants of Allah so long that Allah has in them a Vision."

The man said 'May Allah make me your ransom, what is the Vision, O Master?"

- 117 -

He said 'A Wish/Need, for if He didn't have in them a need He raises us to Him and He does with them what He likes."

And from Mohammed son of Sinan who said Abu Abdullah said 'Verily from us are the Messengers from Allah to His creation. So long that He has a need in His creation, and if He didn't have a need in them He raises us to Him until He desires and He begins to create a creation. We were the first sent to them and as guidance to the creation and veils upon them."

And from Hassan son of Mahmoud from Habil Al Darab and his father Ismail Al Hassan Abu Rafii'Al Mowsali from Jabbir:

The father of Ja'far, Imam Al Baqir said 'O Jabir, Allah's proofs in His creation still remain so long that Allah has a need in them. For if He did not have a need from them He raises us to Him then He destroys them by Burning and Drowning and we the Imams are the proofs after them."

And from Abi Abdullah Al Barqi and from Mohammed son of Sinan and from Saleh son of Ziyad Al Niily, from Yunus son of Dubyan who said: "I asked our Master Al Sadiq about the words of Allah:

_**"Then shall we question those to whom Our message was sent and those by whom**_

_**We sent it. And verily, we shall recount their whole story with knowledge, for We were**_

_**never absent (at any time or place)."**_

(The Holy Qur'an 7:6-7)

Imam Al Sadiq said: "He said 'For the ones we ask and we do not ask them except after their parting from the World and verily they shall know."

And from Hussein son of Yousef from his brother from his father Sayf son of Umaira Al Hanafi who said "I asked Imam Jafar about Allah's words:

_**"Everything shall perish except His face"**_

(The Holy Qur'an 28:88)

Imam Al Sadiq said "We, the Imams in His Servants are His Tongue that He pronounces with and His Hand in His Creation. And we are the face of Allah that gifting is from, we still remain amongst His worshippers so long as Allah has in them a Vision."

The man said "What is the Vision, O Master?”

The Imam said "Need/Desire for if He did not have a need in them, He raised us to Him and did as He pleases."

Then he said "I heard Abu Abdullah say 'Allah did not create a creation before Mohammed dearer to Allah than Mohammed."

And from Mohammed Abi Abdullah Al Barqi from Ishaq son of Amar who asked Abu Abdullah while he was sitting and said to him: O Master, I ask you by the covenant that the Scholars have to inform the people and not hold back, that you tell me about what I ask you."

So Imam Al Sadiq from him peace said to him "Ask about whatever you like."

He said "O Master, His saying that every day He is in a matter/affair, so what are His veils in His affairs that He speaks of."

- 118 -

Imam Al Sadiq said "We the Imams are His Veils and verily from us are His Messengers to all His creation so long that Allah has a need to His creation. And if Allah wanted the destruction of His creation He raises us to Him and if Allah began to create a new creation we are the first sent and we were the Guardians of that creation."

And from Abdullah Al Qasim who said "I heard Abu Abdullah Al Sadiq from him peace say

'Verily from us are the Messengers of Allah to Creation so long as Allah has a need in His creation."

And Imam Al Baqir said "Verily Allah started with the rounds of the Sun rise and ran its Sun 40 Mornings from morning till night without it having a Sun or Moon, for its light is from its own Light. No Haram blood has been spilled on it nor any Sin committed on it and they do not know Allah has created Iblis. And from my father who said when I went in upon him

“What is with you O my son of the Seven Hadiths?"

I said 'I have a lot and I worried that I light a fire for it and burn it"

He said 'Give me what you denied of it' so the Adamites crossed my mind. He said 'And it was not the knowledge of the Angels when they said 'Will you make in it who corrupts in it and spills blood.'

The father of Ja'far said "The Prophet of Allah passed by men from his companions and they were talking so he said to them 'What are you thinking about?" They said 'O Prophet of Allah, we are thinking about the moon and how it does not travel in the sky as the Stars travel if thrown with."

So he said 'Yes in this do you think, verily Allah has 39 Earths, none of which have a Sun or Moon, the Earth lights itself. And no one knows that anyone works in Sins and this Earth of yours is the completion of the Forty (Earths)."

Then he said 'I thought there was no Earth except that Allah gave it and it was trampled over and it has no position concealed except in it is its direction from a prostrating Angel or his feet standing upright."

And from Mohammed Al Baqir that he said to Zurarah 'O Zurarah, verily Allah has a White Earth, its light is from itself, it does not have a Sun nor Moon and it has in it creatures unknown except by Allah. And they did not disobey Allah even the wink of an eye's worth."

Zurarah said "And where is Iblis?"

Imam Al Baqir said "They do not know that Allah created Iblis"

He said "May my soul be your ransom who are the sons of Adam?"

He said "They know that Allah created Adam"

And Imam Al Sadiq said "Our father Adam said 'Verily Allah created 39 Domes from the seed of Adam."

And from Humayran who said "I asked Imam Al Baqir about the Angels and their saying:

_**“Will you make in it who corrupts in it and sheds blood?"**_

(The Holy Qur'an 2:30)

He replied "And where would the Angels know to ask that except in What was before (of previous Rounds)?"

- 119 -

And from Imam Al Baqir who said "There passed upon our father, the Prince of the Believers Ali Ibn Abu Talib a man-"

So he said to him 'O Prince of the Believers what are these Lineages that people trace themselves to" So he cal ed him and said to him "Trace your lineage.’ So he said "Yes, trace my lineage to Aad and Thamud and Qarun and between them a lot."

So Imam Ali said "You do not know how to trace your lineage"

"I wil tel your lineages and I am Ali, the Seventh of the Seven Weeks of the Adamites.”

And the Prophet of Allah said 'Verily Allah has 15,000 Universes and the World has in it one Universe and in the World is 1,000 Nations other than the Jinn and Humans 600 of them are in the Seas and 400 are in the Land."

And from Al Sadiq who said "Three Cycles were 700,000 years and a Round/Turn/Cycle 70,000 years and a Cycle 7,000 years."

And from Imam Al Baqir who said "I spoke about the sons of Israel."

So a man said "May I be your ransom by Allah in the Hadiths of the Seven is what is more amazing than their Hadiths."

Imam Al Baqir said "Perhaps O Man, you seek the Haft-iya?"

The man said "Yes"

So Imam Al Baqir said "Believe in it for it is the Truth."

And from Mohammed son of Ali from the Prince of the Believers who said "Verily, after me are Tribulations, Dark, blind, problematic. Nothing remains in it except the Sleeping"

So it was said "And what is in the Sleeping?"

He said "That when people do not know what is in themselves."

And from Imam Al Baqir who said "Two are between the hands of this matter, the Eclipse of the Moon the Fifth. And an eclipse of the Sun the Fifteen that is so from the descending of Adam to the Earth and then the calculations of the astrologers will fall."

And from Yahya son of Imran who said "I heard Ali son of Hussein say 'Whoever realizes our Qaim and had a flaw is recovered from that. And whoever is sick is healed from it.”

And the son of Hussein said 'Destroyed are the sons of Al Abass at the hands of our Qaim, upon his mention be peace."

And from Yahya son of Imran who said 'I asked Abu Abdullah Ja'far about the absence of this matter, when is it and what is the sign of his absence?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "A sinking of the ground around the bounds of Nahavand (city in Iran) and at Fawat Al Hussein Aqabat Halwan, And a Tremor will hit the people of Persia, And an Earthquake will hit the people of Rome. So if you see that or hear about it then be sure about the occultation of the companion of this matter (Imam Mahdi)"

I said "Oh Master, may I be your ransom, his absence is for sure from Allah."

- 120 -

Imam Al Sadiq said: "As such he was brought out to us and his matter is to Allah, if He wills He speeds and if He wills He slows."

He said "O Master, where is his occultation at?"

Imam Al Sadiq, from him peace, said "From behind this Space of yours"

He said "O Master, there is nothing beyond this Space that surrounds our World-"

Then Imam Al Sadiq smiled and said "I shall tell you about that and will not prevent it from you Inshallah. For beyond this Space is various cities, every city has 12,000 doors, and around every door in every day and night is 12,000 men. No deputyship for them till Judgement Day"

He asked "O Master, and how many are the cities?"

Imam Al Sadiq replied "39 Domes besides the Dome of Adam (a.s.)."

He asked "O Master, from the seed of Adam?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "They do not know that Allah created Adam"

He said "And does O Master, Iblis follow them with his horses?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "They do not know that Allah created Iblis"

He said "O Master, may Allah make me your ransom, how does the Qaim, upon his mention peace, break through them?"

The Imam replied "He breaks through from wherever Allah wills and is between them."

He said "O Master, where is his occultation and in which city of these cities does he take residency?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "He lives wherever he wills and Allah is the One who grants success, for us and for you."

He said "O Master do any of you travel to them?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "Yes we are the Proofs of Allah in them and upon them and they give us the Khums of their money, and do not disobey Allah the blink of an eye's worth."

He said "O Master, and in which times do you travel to them?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "If we are here then we are also there and if we are there then we are also here."

He said "O Master, without a transport or travel?"

So Imam Al Sadiq smiled and said: “But do not alow your love for us to cause you to say other than the truth. We are the Glorified Servants of Allah, we do not speak before Him and we work by His command. And we fear Him with the unseen and we are in Awe of Him, Glory to Him for He has not given us all these goods except by praise. And we are the

- 121 -

Storages of His Knowledge and the Placement of His Secrets and the Safeguards of His Knowledge.

And the Inheritor of His Prophets and Messengers and Veils upon His servants from His creation. Allah chose us, we do not prescribe for ourselves harm nor benefit except with that He wills. Verily what I described to you was with the Power of our Lord"

He asked "O Master, may Allah make me your ransom, from where is the coming out of your Qaim from?"

Imam Al Sadiq replied "From the House of God the Sanctified, and the first to shake his hand pledging allegiance is Gabriel amongst 70,000 Angels and no Angel remains in the sky except that it has pledged allegiance to him."

He said "O Master, I have something which your Glory prevents me from asking about"

Imam Al Sadiq replied "Allah have mercy on you, our Lord commanded us to teach you all that you need."

"So ask about whatever came to mind."

He said "O Master, since when did Allah create the World and how long is its beginning till its extinction?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "50,000 Rounds and every Round is 400,000 Cycles and every Cycle is 400,000 Years"

He said "O Master, may Allah sacrifice myself for you, this matter does not end?"

"The Knowledge of that is with Allah, He sees the Hour near and we see it far away"

He said "O Master, where is Heaven?"

The Imam said "Here."

I said "O Master in the World?"

The Imam said "Yes"

I said to him "And where is the Fire?"

The Imam said "Wherever Allah wills."

I said "O Master, Paradise is in the Earth?"

He said "Yes, verily Allah said:

_**They will say: "Praise be to Allah, Who has truly fulfilled His Promise to us, and has**_

_**given us (this) land in heritage: We can dwell in Paradise as we will. How excellent a**_

_**reward for those who work (righteousness)"**_

(The Holy Qur'an 39:74)

He said "O Master is there an end to Heaven and Hell and a time limit?"

The Imam from him peace said "Yes because Allah said in the story of Heaven and Hell:

- 122 -

_**"They will dwell therein for all the time that the heavens and the earth endure, except**_

_**as thy Lord willeth."**_

(The Holy Qur'an 11:108)

He said "O Master, to where is the destiny of the people of Heaven and the Fire?"

The Imam from him peace said "The inhabitants of the Fire become Straws."

I said "O Master, what is the Straws?"

The Imam said "Bugs and Flies and Ants and the likes of that."

He said "O Master, they transfer from thing to thing?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "Yes, and they transfer from creation to creation, for that is the Greater Punishment."

He said "O Master, what do the people of Paradise become?"

The Imam replied "Angels"

I said "Exactly?"

He said "They become Spiritual Beings"

I asked "O Master, they do not transfer from thing to thing?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "No"

I said "O Master, what do the Adamite females and the Houris become and where is the inhabitation of the people of Paradise?"

The Imam said "Allah speaks to each Believer a Paradise according to his limit and takes for him in it Castles and the Adamite females and the Houris go to their Husbands."

He said "O Master and where does He take for them theParadise in the Earth and in what position?"

He said "O Master and where does He take for them the Paradise in the Earth and in what position?"

The Imam replied "Between the Pillars of the Chair"

He said "O Master, and where are the pillars of the Chair?"

Imam Al Sadiq replied "The chair in length is one thousand thousand pillars, and between each pillar and pillar is the distance of one thousand thousand years, as such its width.

And for them from Allah in every stop is Seventy Thousand Visitors.

And everytime they visit him and return to their homes and they have increased Seventy told the likes that they were given before"

I said "O Master, verily this is the Generous Preference and are they in these Paradises better in livelihood or in this first Paradise?"

So Imam Al Sadiq smiled from him peace and then said:

- 123 -

"O Bashar, rather the First Paradises beside Allah are better than the Second Paradise. Did you not know that Allah trades between them in the first Paradises because of His nearness and closeness so He chose with them from His sight.”

He said "O Master, the Adamite females transfer from condition to condition?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "Yes O Bashar, they transfer from sex to sex and from goodness to goodness and from light to light and from blessing to the best of blessings."

He said "O Master, all praises to Allah that has not given from His knowledge to anyone but you, He specialized you by His Preference without all of His creation."

Imam al Sadiq said "O Bashar, may Allah have mercy on you, do not tell the secret that I have given you from the secret of Allah alone."

Then Imam Al Sadiq said "The matter of the Qaim and his rise is to Allah alone"

I said "O Master, does he not have signs?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "Rather he has various signs"

I said "What are they O Master?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "A fire reaching from here" and he pointed his hand towards the Qibla and to the East"

I said "O Master, all this in one night?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "Yes and there is a Maskh in India and Sind"

"And Al Hussein enters Halwan"

I said "O Master, to what destination does he seek?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "He seeks a modern city, on the beach of Al Basra"

I said "O Master is it not Al Zawra (Baghdad)?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "No"

I said "O Master then what happens?"

He said "The coming down of soldiers on the Beach of Sihan of Basra.

And there comes out on the beach of the Tigris River from Al Basra a man from the sons of my father peace be upon him.

He wants to enter in but he is prevented from that by the most severe of preventions.

And he returns leaving from it and he simmered for it the Armies from Bani Mardas.

And between him and them are many incidents and will remain as such by Allah until there is killed on his hand around Sixty Thousand"

I said "O Master then what happens?"

Imam Al Sadiq from him peace said "They remain as such until he enters it and kills its agent and the agent of Bani Mardas.

- 124 -

So he stays in it however Allah wills then its inhabitants pledge their allegiance to him in hate without obedience and they give him the Tenth.

So if he is assured and grasps, they betray him and break into his house at night and kill his companions and raid their homes.

And he rids himself and flees from his companions and its inhabitants and goes out escaping from it.

And his companions Bani Mardas raise one of their heads on a channel and claim that they killed him.

And if you see a fourth of his head on a couch/bed or with hands then do not believe in his killing, for he left escaping from it by Allah.

And he is delivered with his head and he goes until he reaches Yemen, and the people gather to him from the tribes of the Arabs and the devoted are peoples that are great in character.

Then he goes out with them until he reaches your Kufa and he stays in it God willing and a people from Kufa gather to him and he leaves it until he reaches Al Basra.

So he wins it by night and enters it and he kills from it many creatures and he burns with it many tribes then he returns to Kufa."

Bashar said "O Master, then after that what happens?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "What happens is whatever Allah wants"

He said "O Master, may I be your ransom, hurry with the answer, I have not asked except desiring that."

Imam Al Sadiq said "Know that one of our followers still remains in Kufa giving life to its outlying areas and spends it in his companions. And he taked out his Fifth (Khums) and pushes it to his family"

He said "O Master, where is the companion of this command that day during his occultation?"

Imam Al Sadiq replied "Wherever Allah wills."

I said "O Master, it has been narrated to us from your father Imam Mohammed Al Baqir that the companion of this matter's occultation is in some your descendants."

Imam Al Sadiq smiled and then said "My father has told the truth, verily the companion of this matter is from behind this Space surrounded by Knowledge in Land and Sea."

Then Imam Al Sadiq said "Rather in various cities"

He said "O Master, what do we do with that which has been narrated from your father?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "Know you and your brothers that the Stations/Ranks of men with us are decided upon how much they can handle about us. The friend of Allah, Abraham said 'I am impotent' but why impotent? Do you see him as a liar?"

Nay by Allah but rather he was truthful and He knows best what he said, may peace and blessings be upon him"

Then he said "O Master, in those cities are from the sons of Adam?"

The Imam said "They don't know that Allah created Adam"

I said "O Master, does Iblis make them do wrong?"

- 125 -

The Imam said "They don't know that Allah created Iblis"

Bashar said "O Master do they know you Truly?"

"Yes, they come to us with fruits out of its season and they give us their Khums (Fifth) that Allah made incumbent and a duty for us in His book. And they are more adhering to us than you"

He said "O Master, do they have intercourse and give birth?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "Yes, like Adam and Eve"

He said "O Master, Allah sent them Messengers as He sent them to the sons of Adam?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "Yes, He sent the Messengers to all of creation and to all who are without the Throne and all that He created" He said "O Master, and they decided upon your Authority"

Imam Al Sadiq said "Whoever denies one of us then he is to us and no Vicegerent did they deny and they do not deny us for we are the light house of Allah in His land then His trustees upon His creation"

I said "All praises due to Allah who let me know the extremities of your preference"

Imam Al Sadiq from him peace said "May Allah have mercy on you, Allah has not made known to anyone the extremities of our preference except the worth of a White hair in a Black Bull. As for the worth of our preference and knowledge in the knowledge of Allah and His preference is not but the worth of what a bird carries with its beak from the sea that Allah mentioned in His book."

He said "O Master, all praises to Allah that has no similar to Him, there is no God but Allah that has no description to Him nor attribute."

Then Imam Al Sadiq said "Our Lord was before the directions and is the Creator of the directions. And He is the after and He is the Creator of the after and the destination of every destination. And He is the Beginner of everything and its Creator and the Beginning of Beginning and the Everlasting of the End"

Then Imam Al Sadiq glued his cheek to the ground and by Allah I heard him say this:

"My Lord and Aide, and Master and Support and Creator and Sustainer, and if He wills He tortures me so He forbids me and if He wills He has mercy on me by His Grace, woe that day to the ones who belief!"

Then Imam Al Sadiq turned his cheek on the dust while saying: "I am your Servant and the son of your Servant and the Grandson of your Servant and the son of your nation I have become poor to your Mercy"

"I am pledged to it, O my God, have mercy on my faults and poverty and have mercy on my neediness O Master by Victory over my enemies for without Your Victory, I shall be one of the lovers"

Then Imam Al Sadiq raised his head and said something that was not audible.

So he said "I'm at your command my Master"

Imam Al Sadiq "Safeguard what we have revealed to you from the Knowledge of Allah that He safeguarded From His Angels"

He said "O Master, when will this cover be revealed?"

So the Imam cried until his tears ran and then said "O Robiee, God willing that has the Ability and Power with creation and the matter Inshallah is upon the Trusted and Trustworthy"

And from Abu Abdullah who said "When the Prophet of Allah Mohammed approached death he said:

"O Ali if I die then wash me and embalm me and clothe me and sit me and I shall tell you what will happen till Judgement Day"

"So when he died Ali washed him and embalmed him and clothed him then sat him so Mohammed told him what would happen till Judgement Day."

And from Abi Ali Al Kofi who said "I was at Imam Al Baqir's so there walked into his place a Red man wearing Green clothes"

So he said "Peace be upon you O father of Ja'far and the blessings of Allah and His mercy"

So Imam Al Baqir replied with the best of greetings.

So I said to him "Who are you O Man, may Allah have mercy on you"

So he said to me 'I am your brother and companion when I came to you in Khurasan and you hosted me on such and such night"

So Abu Ali Al Kufi said to the father of Ja'far Imam Al Baqir from him peace "I have never seen him in this appearance, O Master"

So Imam Al Baqir smiled and then said "He is from the veiled, he is veiled with what we want"

So he said "O Master, and what did he reach from the truth of his belief?"

So Imam Al Baqir said "O Dawal, nothing was too much on Allah due to his closeness to Him"

I said "O Master, and how ignorant are the people from the likes of this" and the man disappeared.

So Imam Al Baqir from him peace said "That is a Servant if you/who asked and was given six proofs, he is veiled by them wherever he wants in the Kingdoms of the Skies and Earth"

So I said "O Master, how great is the right of the Believer with Allah"

So Imam Al Baqir said "O Dawal, do not be prideful on Allah and thus make your rewards to that and thus you are destroyed. For verily to every trustworthy Believer is seven veils, if he leaves from his Bodies and it is revealed from him, he becomes next to that"

So Dawal said "O Master, describe what you have tasted from the sweetness of faith, to what does the Believers become in the Afterlife if they finish"

Imam Al Baqir said "Angels close to the Most Merciful, and He speaks to them and they speak to Him with the number of Spirits of the Paradises"

He said "O Master, to where do the cursed go who opposed you?"

The Imam replied "Pests and Maskh from the Pests, Serpents and Scorpions and Swine and what has no good in it after the intensity of torment. And Allah knows best that His mercy encompasses all things and He is that Most Merciful of the Merciful. THE END"
