الباب الثاني والستون : فى معرفة الطبائع والطرائق والقدد 

ويصير منها 

وصور 

قال الصادق : إفهم ثبتك الله القول الثابت أن الله سطع نوره، ثم خلق منه فذة وصورة، ثم أمره أن يق صورة وقا. فأقاموا صورة وقدا على النور المسطوح، ثم عبدوا الله ولم يعصونه، ثم أمر أن يخلق نارة مسطوحة وأمره أن يقذ منها قددا طيورا حورا، فقاموا الله عابدين فتهبات النورانية أن تختلط في النارية فاختلط ،بعضها فسطح خلق من خلقين ثم أمره أن يخلق ريحا ، فخلق، ثم أمره فقد منها قدا وصور منها صورة، وقة منها فدا فأمر الريحية أن لا تختلط في المسائية فاختلط ثم خلق طينة من البحرين العذب القرات والملح الأجاج ، ثم أمره وقف منه قددا منه صورة فأمر المائية أن لا تختلط بالطينية، فاختلط البعض، فسطح منه ما كان بدء الخلق الممزوج الأربعة النور والنار والريح والماء، وسطح منه طينة آدم، ثم خلق من شان الأخرة فركبت الأطباع، ومن الشيء نصفه خلق مسافة من الصخرة وهم عليها قرار الأرضين، لأن سطحه على حوت وصار الحوت على الماء، وصار الماء على الصخرة، والصخرة بيضاء، وهي على الهواء ما بين الهواء إلى الصخرة والجن هناك جامدة مركب الطبقة ثم خلق آدم وأسكنه ظهرها و أمره ونهاه وجعل ثوابه في الأمر والنهي في الدنيا والآخرة، وما على ظهر الطبق مما أجرى عليه الله وعلى ذريته ومنه ماكلها ومشربها والنوم، وطلب الأزواج، ثم قد فتح لهم فيها من شهواتها وزينتها ولهوها ولعبها، ثم قال تعالى في كتابه العزيز: «الْمَالُ وَالْبَنُونَ زِينَةُ الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا وَالْبَاقِيَاتُ الصَّالِحَاتُ خَيْرٌ عِنْدَ رَبِّكَ ثَوَابًا وَخَيْرٌ أَمَلًا فالباقيات الصالحات الأمر بالمعروف وما يعملون إلى طاعته و تركيب مزاجه في زخرفها وباطلها وأزواجها و 

أموالها. وقال تعالى: «يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِنْ مِنْ أَزْوَاجِكُمْ وَأَوْلَادِكُمْ عَدُوا لَكُمْ فَاحْذَرُوهُمْ»، ثم قال 

اللهم العن الجبت والطاغوت 

تعالى: «إِنَّمَا أَمْوَالُكُمْ وَأَوْلَادُكُمْ فِتْنَةٌ وَالله عِنْدَهُ أَجْرٌ عَظِيمٌ». ورغبهم في الباقيات وجعل ما يفنا فتنة لهم وأمرهم أن يتخذوا منهم، فأما الذي قد انتهوا عنه فقد جاءتهم العقوبات والآفات والبلى من أنواع الأسقام ومن النقصان في الأولاد والأنفس ومني لم يقيموا ما أمروا به من طاعة الله جاءهم من العذاب ما وعدهم به من مسح وخسف وقد قال تعالى في قرية من تقدم من ولد أدم فإنه أهلكهم بعذاب الدنيا وبعذاب الآخرة فمنهم من أخذهم بالطوفان، ومنهم من أخذتهم الرجفة، ومنهم ممن مسخ قردة وخنازير وأشباه ذلك من عذاب الآخرة. ثم قال تعالى: «وَلَنُذِيقَنَهُمْ مِنَ الْعَذَابِ الْأَدْنَى دُونَ الْعَذَابِ الْأَكْبَرِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ»، اي يعني يتناهون عما نهوا عنه، وقال تعالى: « لَئِنْ شَكَرْتُمْ لَأَزِيدَنَكُمْ وَلَئِنْ كَفَرْتُمْ إِنَّ عَذَابِي لَشَدِيدٌ»، يقول تعالى: «لَئِنْ شَكَرْتُمْ لَأَزِيدَنَّكُمْ»، يعني في ثواب الدنيا والآخرة زيادة في الأموال والأولاد والمعاش، وقد قال :نوح اسْتَغْفِرُوا رَبَّكُمْ إِنَّهُ كَانَ غَفَّارًا يُرْسِلِ السَّمَاءَ عَلَيْكُمْ مِدْرَارًا وَيُمْدِدْكُمْ بِأَمْوَال وَبَنِينَ وَيَجْعَلْ لَكُمْ جَنَّاتٍ وَيَجْعَلْ لَكُمْ أَنْهَارًا» يقول تعالى عاجلا وأجلا فوقروا الله سبحانه عاجلا وأجلاء الذي جعل لكم فيها مستمعة في مشيئة أخرى لهم حججا ورس يخبرونهم عن ربهم بحد ما نهوا عنه، فلما أعرضوا عن رسلهم ختم بما فتح لهم ثم أنابوا إليه منابة، فقال، جل ذكره «وَلَقَدْ جِئْتُمُونَا فُرَادَى كَمَا خَلَقْنَاكُمْ أَوَلَ مَرَةٍ» ثم قال: «أَوَلَيْسَ الَّذِي خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ بِقَادِرِ عَلَى أَنْ يَخْلُقَ مِثْلَهُمْ بَلَى وَهُوَ الْخَلَاقُ الْعَلِيمُ . إِنَّمَا أَمْرُهُ إِذَا أَرَادَ شَيْئًا أَنْ يَقُولَ لَهُ كُنْ فَيَكُونُ فَسُبْحَانَ الَّذِي بِيَدِهِ مَلَكُوتُ كُل شَيْءٍ وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ»، فالملكوت هو ملكوت الطريق والقدد الأولى والكل قذه طريقه وملكوت في العليم علوا كبيرا، وله الحمد دائما وأبدأ وعليه القديم، تعالى الله عما يقولوا الظالمون فليتوكل المؤمنون

**"In Knowing the Characteristics and Corners and Slats"**

Imam Ja'far Al Sadiq said "Understand (may) Allah make you Firm upon the Stable Speech.

Verily Allah Spread out His Light. Then He created from it a Slat and Image. Then He commanded it to cut into images and strips. So they came forth images and strips on the spread out Light then they Worshipped Allah and did not Disobey Him.

Then He commanded that Spread out Fire be created. And He commanded him to cut from it strips and that Changed Birds com forth from it.

So they came forth to Allah worshippers.

So the Light-ed prepared to mix in the Fiery so some of them mixed.

So He spread out a Creation from two Creations then He commanded him that Wind be created.

So it was created then He commanded that Strips be cut from it and He pictured from it Images and they came forth to Allah worshippers. And He commanded the Fiery not to mix in the Windy and some of it mixed.

So He spread out the land that was mixed.

So He commanded him to create Water so it was created and He fashioned Images from it and cut from it Strips.

So He commanded the Windy not to mix in the Watery. And they mixed.

Then He created Mud from the two Seas, the Pure and the Salty then He commanded him to cut strips from it and he fashioned images from it.

And He commanded the Watery not to mix with the Muddy and some of them mixed.

So Spread forth from it came what was the beginning of the Creation that was combined of Four: Light, Fire, Wind and Water.

And Spread out from that was the Mud of Adam then He created the matter of the Here after so the Traits were installed.

And of a thing, half is created high and the other half is created Low from the Rock and he troubled it with the decision of the two lands.

Because it’s Surface is on a Whale

And the Whale became on Water

And the Water became on the Rock

And the Rock is White and it is on Air

What is between the Air to the Rock and the Jinn are there,Motionless Vehicles of the Layer.

Then He created Adam and made him habitate the back of it and He commanded him and forbid him and made his reward in the commanding and forbidding in the World and Afterlife.

e Straws are 7 Species of Bird and Fish and Beast and Lion and Vermin and Stone and Plant. And 70 Kinds of Fish and 70 Kinds of Wild Beasts and Domestic and Seventy Kinds of Wild and Domestic Lions and that's Allah's words:

"There is not an animal (that lives) on the earth, nor a being that flies on its wings, but

are nations like you."

(The Holy Qur'an 6:38)

"So the best of the Beasts and the tastiest meat and milk are what are the most in numbers and the Best of Birds what have Crops and Gizzards. And the Best and Sweetest of Fish Meat are what have scales. For what was of it like that is Naskh (Duplication or Transmigration of Soul from same kind to same kind) and what is other than that is Maskh.

And what was of the Straws in the Womb, they have tails and what is in the Eggs, also he has a tail and what is in the Womb Breast Feeds and what is in the Eggs feeds and gathers.

And what is Naskh is good to eat and what is Maskh is Haram to eat and his self lessens and his injuries like the lions of Beasts then Birds.

And the Vermins are actually a Maskh that turns into a Jewel that they carried with them.

And the Pearl and Ruby and the Precious Stones/Gems are Naskh and the Iron and Copper and Lead are Maskh and that is what Allah reported in His book:

"There is not a thing but celebrates His praise: And yet ye understand not how they

declare His glory! Verily He is often Forbearing, Most Forgiving!"

(The Holy Qur'an 17:44)

“ And Allah said:


Say: "(Nay!) be ye stones or iron Or created matter which, in your minds, is hardest (to

be raised up). Then will they say: 'Who will cause us to return?"

Say: "He who created you the First time!" Then will they wag their heads towards thee,

and say, 'When wil that be?’ Say, 'maybe it wil be quite soon!"

(The Holy Qur'an 17:51)

Imam Al Sadiq continued "And Allah said

'Do they not look at Allah's creation, (even) among (inanimate) things.-How their (very)

shadows turn round, from the right and the left, prostrating themselves to Allah, and

that in the humblest manner?" (The Holy Qur'an 16:48)

"And Imam Al Sadiq said

"Al ah said 'Each one knows its own (mode of) prayer and praise.”

(The Holy Qur'an 24:41)

For that is the Detail in the matter of the Rounds and Peace."

What is between the Air to the Rock and the Jinn are there,Motionless Vehicles of the Layer.

Then He created Adam and made him habitate the back of it and He commanded him and forbid him and made his reward in the commanding and forbidding in the World and Afterlife.

And in what is on the back of the Layer of what Allah ran upon it and upon its seed and from it its food and drink and sleep and seeking marriage partners.

Then He opened for them in it of its Lusts and Adornments and Playfulness then Allah said in His Great Book:

"Wealth and sons are allurements of the life of this world: But the thing that endure,

good deeds, are best in the sight of thy Lord. But the things that endure, good deeds,

are best in the sight of thy Lord, as rewards, and best as (the foundation for) hopes."

(The Holy Qur'an 18:46)

"For the things that endure of good deeds is commanding good and what they do to Obey Him. And the installation of his frame of mind in its adornments and falsehoods and marriage partners and its money and Allah said:

- 107 -

"O ye who believe! Truly, among your wives and your children are enemies to

yourselves: so beware of them!"

(The Holy Qur'an 64:14)

Then Allah said:

"Your riches and your children are but a trial; but in the Presence of Allah, is the

highest, Reward."

(The Holy Qur'an 64:15)

And their desire for things which endure/last and He made what perishes as a Trial for them and their command is to beware of them.

As for that which they were forbidden from there came to them the Punishments and Trials and Tribulations from the kinds of bad health and Shortings in Sons and Selves And when they did not do what they were commanded with from the Obedience of Allah, there came to them of the Punishment that He promised them with of Maskh and Lowliness And Allah said in the Seed of who came forth from the sons of Adam. For He destroyed them with the Punishment of the World and with the Punishment of the Afterlife and of them were those taken by the flood. And of them were those taken by the trembling and of them are those who went into Maskh as Monkeys and Pigs and the likes of that of the Torture of the Afterlife.

Then Allah said:

'And indeed We will make them taste of the lower Penalty prior to the supreme

Penalty, in order that they may return.'

(The Holy Qur'an 32:21)

-meaning they stop doing what they were forbidden. And Allah said:

'If ye are grateful, I will add more (favours) unto you; But if ye show ingratitude, truly

My punishment is terrible indeed."

(The Holy Qur'an 14:7)

Allah says:

'If you are thankful I will add more' (The Holy Qur'an 14:7) Meaning increases in the rewards of the world and Afterlife in money and progeny and living.

And Noah had said 'Seek forgiveness from your Lord, He is often Forgiving, He sends the Sky upon you in Abundance and He supports you with moneyand offspring and He makes for you Gardens and makes for you Rivers.

Allah says:

'Sooner and later so Glorify Him sooner and later, He that made in it a Listener in

another Will"

They have Veils and Messengers that tell them about their Lord in proportion to what they stopped that they were forbidden. So when they turned from their Messengers, He made their End the same as their Beginning. Then they turned to Him such a turn for Allah said:

"And behold! ye come to us bare and alone as We created you for the first time."

(The Holy Qur'an 6:94)

"And you have known the first creation, so will you not remember?"

(The Holy Qur'an 56:62)

- 108 -

“Is not He who created the heavens and the earth Able to create the likes of them?

Yes, (it is so); and He is the Knowing Creator.The command is only when He intends a

thing that He says to it, "Be," and it is. So exalted is He in whose hand is the realm of

all things, and to Him you will be returned."

(The Holy Qur'an 36:81-83)

For the Realm is the Realm of the Path and the First Strips and everyone's Strip is a Path and a Realm in the Knowing, the Old. Allah is much Higher than what the wrongful say and claim to Him is praise always and forever and upon Him the Believers should trust their affairs."
