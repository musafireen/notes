الباب الثالث والأربعون فى معرفة نسل الكافر وما يصيبه من وشريف ماله وما العلة في ذلك 

**"In Knowing the Lineage of the Disbeliever and what strikes him of Good and Evil and** **Poverty and Sickness and Tragedy and the reason in that"**

قال المفضل: سألت مولانا الصادق عن الكافر ومناكحهم في المسوخية؟ وعن النسل الذي يخرج منهم وما يصيبهم من الخير والشر والبلاء والصحة وما العلة في 

ذلك؟ 

فقال الصادق یا مفضل إن من الكافرين من يتركب في المسوخية ومنهم من يتركب في خلق الإنسان، ومنهم من يتركب في البهيمة، وهي جزاء على قدر اعماله التي سلفت منه في التركيب الأول. 

قال المفضل: وكيف ذلك؟ قال الصادق : أما علمت أن من البهائم من يتدلل وينعم ويموت موتا من غير ذبح أو كسر في بدمه، ومنهم من يذبح ذبحا منهم ما يقتل بالكسر ومنهم ما يعذب بأنواع العذاب وتصيبهم آفات كثيرة، وكذلك ما يركب في الصورة الإنسائية من الكافرين يفعل الله به ذلك ومنهم من يموت موتا على فراشه في عيش رغد. ومنهم من يقتل قتلا، ومنهم من يذبح ذبحة ويعذب بأنواع العذاب من الكة والتعب في طلب المعاش، فهو في عذاب شديد وجهد جهيد. فهذا هو الفرق بين الكافر وصورة الانسانية وصورة البهيمية والفرق بينه وبين البهائم في المطعم والمشرب والملبس والتفاضل بينهم بالأعمال، فكل من سبقت له الأعمال من البر والخير من تسبیح وصلاة وزكاة، فإنما يوفى أجره على قدر ذلك من الإحسان والإساءة، وكذلك في 

هذه الدنيا. 

قال المفضل يا مولاي، وهل يكون للكافر صلاة وزكاة وصيام وحج؟ 

اللهم العن الجبت والطاغوت 

۲۵ 

قال الصادق : یا مفضل، أما رأيت صلاة النصارى وصيامهم وحجهم؟ 

وكذلك اليهود وجميع أهل الأديان والشرائع المتغايرة ونوافلها معروفة؟ فمنهم من يميل إلى شيء من أعمال البر ، ومنهم من يميل إلى اجتراح السيئات. فأما المائل إلى أعمال البر فهو بخلاف غيره ، ثم قرأ: « فَمَنْ يَعْمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَةٍ خَيْرًا يَرَهُ * وَمَنْ يَعْمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَةٍ شَرًا يَرَهُ ». 

قال المفضل: يا مولاي هذه الآية في المؤمنين دون الكافرين، ألم يخصص المؤمن من الكافر في الأعمال خاصته، فما جزاء الكافرين؟ 

قال الصادق : يخفف العذاب عن الكافر في المسوخية وإنه أرحم الراحمين

hall be kept from you. And I am warning you of the son of Abu Talib, don't let what you see seduce you, do you know what I saw of his magic?"

Salman said "What did you see?"

Umar said "One night I was in my home and some disagreement between me and him took place so as we were like that and we had conversated for a long time, he said to me 'Stay where you are at until I get back. He (Imam Ali) left and returned back instantly before the blink of an eye, and he had on his head a white turban and on it was dust. I said to him

'Where did you go?"

He said "A sect of Angels came forth marching and with them was the Prophet of Allah and he (the prophet) was seeking a city in the East called (Shakhoor) and it lies at the Rising place of the Sun."

- 69 -

Imam Ali said "So I got up and received the Prophet of Allah (sawas) then I greeted him and this dust that you see Umar is from the cries of the Angels!"

Umar said "So I laughed at what he said O Salman! I said to him 'How can that be when the man has died 5 years ago and you claim to have just met up with him in this hour? That can never be!"

Imam Ali said "Woe to you, Umar, are you calling me a liar?"

Then Umar said "Don't be mad son of Abu Talib, what you say is unheard of, where did you get this type of talk?

Imam Ali said "Would you like me to show you the Prophet along with the Angels?"

So when Umar heard that he said "Yes, how could I refuse such a wonder?"

So Imam Ali told Umar to get up and brought him outside to the road of Madinah and he wiped his eye and said "Look" and Umar said "When I looked I saw so many horses, and the Prophet was coming with the Angels and I recognized him as he looked except for his beard and hair were White."

Umar said "Then I remained in amazement until the Prophet of Allah and the Angels and horses passed by me and while I am looking at them, your friend Ali said to me 'Did you find what I told you about?' so I said 'Yes."

Umar then said "While in amazement he then wiped my eyes with his hand and I couldn't see anything, (everything disappeared) so when he did that and showed me what I saw I became afraid of him and knew he was a great Magician. Don't let his magic fool you Salman, and avoid him and safeguard what happened between me and you here today, and be from us and with us so what I make you in charge of territories, if you like I could give you Persia!”

Then Umar said "I hope you do not tell the son of Abu Talib about what I told you about his magic because I do not feel safe from him."

Salman said "And did you see anything other than that from him?"

Omar said "I have seen what is more strange and that is if he got mad he pulled out a Bow and throws it on the ground and it turns into a Great Snake that resembles the Snake of Moses and it opens its mouth as the Snake did with Pharaoh. And if Ali wishes to command the Snake to devour an entire Mountain it would devour it and it is for this reason O Salman that I feared him and I took precautions against him."

Salman said "And did you see with your eyes these wonders from him?"

Omar replied "Yes O Salman, and if I hadn't seen it I wouldn't have pointed you to it."

So Salman said "And how did you see it, tell me?"

Omar said "Ali came to me one day angry and he had this bow that I told you about and he said to me 'O Omar, O' Enemy of Allah and Enemy of His Prophet! And Enemy of his Vicegerent and Enemy of his Purified Offspring and Preferred ones of their Followers, you stick to your tyrant Shia and do not come close to my Shia of the Believers. Verily I shall bond you and your Group of Oppressors' then he (Ali) made me (Omar ibn Khattab) listen to a lot of talk that happened between me and him"

- 70 -

So Omar said to him "O Son of Abu Talib, Did you forget my Kindness to you in the time of the rule of Abu Bakr. They bounced on you wanting you to go out and give allegiance to Abu Bakr. And when Fatima Zahraa saw that she sought refuge with the companion of the Grave saying 'O my father! O what had befallen me after you!' and she cried. So when she cried I had mercy on her and turned from her/you and I didn't think you would deny it.

And that was when Khalid Ibn Waleed thought about attacking you, for when I met up with them I didn't know what they had agreed upon. And Khalid ibn al Waleed worried about killing you after Abu Bakr was done with prayer so Abu Bakr called out before finishing his prayer for Khalid not to do as he (Abu Bakr) had commanded him to. And you O Ali, were standing there next to him and you felt the evil and knew that which was between us and Khalid.

And I was harsher on Khalid than you for his doings with the people of AlRida and for his killing Ibn Nuwayrah and his taking his wife. And I was determined to tie him but Abu Bakr forbade me from that. And what I did puplicly and said that the allegiance to Abu Bakr was a Trial and Allah saved the Believers from the worst of it so whoever returns to that, kill them.

But you O Bani (son of) Hashem do not thank anyone for their helping hand nor for any good.

As for what has been told to you by your Shia about me, they are ripping my skin and (backbiting me) and by Allah if it wasn't for your place, I would have assaulted them and killed them but after today I won't oppose you."

So when your companion (Ali) heard this, he laughed hard and said to me ‘O Enemy of Al ah, you are kind to me?' then the anger settled from him. And he threw his bow to the ground and it was suddenly a Great Snake and it opened its mouth then came towards me and Ali was looking at me and laughing.

And he said to me 'O Enemy of Allah, what do you want me to do with you?"

Omar said to him 'I have seen and known so take O Ali, this Bow and leave you and your snake away from me!"

So he shouted at me at a great Shout then he took his Bow and it returned as it was, not a Snake nor a Serpent and I still to this day fear him"

Imam Al Sadiq continued "So Salman became amazed and said ‘It is by the likes of this Wonder and these Godly Miracles that we have known Ali."

Then Omar said 'O Salman if it wasn't for my own eyes seeing it, I wouldn't have believed it but I have seen and witnessed it. And finally what was between us of reservations and fears has been lifted, and I hope that you deny the son of Abu Talib and choose mixing with us.

And I have informed you and perhaps you have heard similar (stories) from others"

So Salman said 'Omar, tell me more about Ali, For I want to simplify him and bring out what he has."

Omar said 'O Salman, my father Al Khattab told me that he saw Abu Talib practicing Magic and that he never saw nor heard of a Magician like him ever."

And my father also mentioned that Abdul Muttalib used to do this Magic too and the Wonder of Wonders, those Banu Hashem; they inherit Magic elder toelder and generation by generation."

- 71 -

So Salman said 'Tell me Omar, about what your father said about Imran (Abu Talib)"

Omar said 'My father went out one day with Imran in his travels and they had a large group with them so some Arabs came out on them carrying weapons. They wanted to block their road so my father said in that day our Caravan was great in size and it had many camels and creatures."

(Khattab said) 'So when we saw the Arabs we became frightened and a shout was shouted and everyone went to their weapons and we wore all that we had"

"And we were scared..and when we took (the weapons) we prepared for war and gathered and my father and the group looked at Imran for he had no weapon". So they said to him 'O

Abu Talib do you not see those Arabs that have come towards us, wanting to block our path?

So take what you were given so we can prevent them from harming us."

So Abu Talib laughed and said 'What shall I do with weapons when fighting those (great numbers of) people, I wonder if we fight them and make them fall, would we then be stronger than them?"

So I (Khattab) said ‘no.’

So Abu Talib said 'And what is the meaning of Fighting them?"

Khattab said 'And what is the trick?"

Imran said 'The trick is to go into this Island that is behind us so that they will break up and leave us"

So Khattab said 'I was bewildered by the talk of Abu Talib and his mentioning of an Island and there was no Island"

So Imran said 'Woe to you, look behind you' so when I looked behind me and By Allah I was on an Island of the Islands of the Sea, I had not seen anything like it before."

Omar son of Khattab said "By Allah that is of what he said about the Magic of Imran and his father Abdul Muttalib, they did good with us and a favour. So my father Al Khattab said to Abu Talib 'Tell me how we do reach that Island and the Sea is between us and we have no Ships to cut that distance of Sea?"

So Abu Talib said 'Woe to you, look with your eyes to that dry road that is in the Middle of the Sea."

So Khattab said 'I looked and there was by Allah an easy dry path' so when we saw that our faces lit with joy and we knew that we had survived by Imran's Magic."

**The Miracles of Imran (Abu Talib) Hashem (a.s.)**

_Father of Imam Ali (as) and Uncle of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh)_

Khattab said 'Then Abu Talib took the path before us and we behind him until he reached the Island with us."

Then he (Imran/Abu Talib) said "Place your things/travels in this position, for no one will reach us nor will their plot reach us." And at that point the Arabs approached, running behind us, in our trace until they reached the Sea between us and them, then they looked at one

- 72 -

another in wonder. And they were surprised and they said to one another 'We have never seen such in our life, here there is no sea nor water!"

An older man with them said 'Do they have amongst them any of the sons of Abdul Muttalib?"

They said 'Yes, they have Imran with them."

The Old man said 'Leave, for there is no reaching them now, do not tire yourselves."

Some of the Arabs said 'Do not leave until we reach them on that Island' and a man of them said to his Arab companions 'Go through the Sea from that dry path."

"And we will be behind you' so they went after one another until they reached the middle of the Sea and they all drowned"

The old man said 'I have advised you and you did not accept my advice and I told you do not pursue them as long as they have with them the sons of Abdul Muttalib.

"Verily, the sons of Abdul Muttalib have Protection and Safeguarding from Allah, no one can reach them to harm them but you disobeyed me."

So Al Khattab said to the Old man as he was parallel to the Sea and hadn't caught up with his people who drowned 'O Sheikh, what do you know about the sons of Abdul Muttalib?"

The Old man said 'One day we went forth and we came upon a group of Arabs with many horses, so we said to one another 'What should we do with this Caravan and that is in it of money?"

"So we took turns fighting them until we were almost broken so we ran away in front of them and kept running for three days and the people were in our trace. And we would look back at them and everytime we said we have mingled with them (i.e. they caught up) there would be a sudden long distance between us. And we do not know the reason of that then we became hungry and thirsty and we did not reach them nor did they reach us. And with the people was a brother of Abu Talib called Abdullah ibn Abdul Muttalib and he used to say to his companions 'Go forth and do not fear and God willing they will not reach you."

**The Miracle of Abdullah Hashem (a.s.)**

Father of the Holy Prophet Mohammed (pbuhahf) and Uncle of Imam Ali (as)

So a man with us said 'Rest yourselves and let us rest, you have grown tired and your animals are tired and those people are Magicians, we'll never catch up with them. And my opinion is that you should leave them for a while perhaps they will go from you and place their Caravan and then we will attack while they are in a slumber and do not feel it. And we all agreed to that plot so we left them until we disappeared from their sight and they parked their Caravan but Abdullah was not heedless of his people.

He drew a circle around their Caravan and said 'O people of Quraysh, no one leaves the circle, it is a protection for you against your enemies."

His people said to him (Abdullah) 'We have heard and we obey' so when we saw that they parked their caravan and were heedless we rode and decided to attack and break in on them."

So when we approached the Circle that Abdullah had drawn we looked and there was a barrier between us and them, we have never seen stronger than it. And we remained for

- 73 -

three days working hard to get to them but we couldn't so we returned disappointed after we had perished and a great number of us perished."

So when Al Khattab heard the testimony of the old man he looked to Imran and said 'O Abu Talib, you the children of Abdul Muttalib have inherited from your father Substantial Knowledge"

So Abu Talib said 'O Khattab, that which the old man spoke of happened when I was also with them and I was then a young boy and that old man was on his camel and he had his weapon on him.."

So the Old man said 'By Allah you have spoken the truth and I was with them when they sent us away and we returned in the same path we came. And we did not see in the path that we took a Sea nor Water nor an Island and that was the case until we reached Al-Sham and we passed by that path more than twenty times and by Allah we never saw a Sea nor Island nor Water."

So Khattab said to the old man 'You have spoken about that to many tribes and everyone you spoke to was in wonderment over that."

So the old man said 'By Allah we took that path twice and didn't see anything"

So Omar said to Salman the Persian 'Did you ever hear or see the likes of this Magic? The people know that Ahlul Bayt inherit Magic."

So Salman said 'O Omar, I don't think anyone believes what you are saying, that my friend Ali son of Abu Talib is a Magician and nothing of that is true"

Omar said 'I see you think I am a Liar"

Salman said 'No Omar, all that you said is true but it is not magic."

Omar said 'O Salman the son of Abu Talib has cast a spell upon you"

Salman said 'What do yo say about releasing the two horns and money that came to you from Khurasan?"

Omar said 'Did your friend Ali tell you about the story of the money and the horns?"

Salman said 'Yes, he told me""Omar said 'Ask your friend son of Abu Talib, and let him know that I will release them from this money and will distribute it in everything he wants."

So Salman left to the Prince of the Believers Ali and when he approached Ali he looked at Salman and said 'O Salman nothing took place between you and Omar except that I knew it and if you like I can tell you about it" Salman said 'Allah knows Best that He does not hide anything from you and I told Omar that you are neither a Mage nor Magician and Omar said to me 'your friend put you under his Magic' as for the horns he has promised to release the money and spend what came to him from Khurasan to whoever you order him to the Prince of the Believers said 'I see him distributing it in the tents of the Muhajireen and the Ansar so go to him Salman and tell him to bring it to the Masjid of the Prophet of Allah and distribute it there."

So Salman said 'At your command Master' then he left to Omar and mentioned to him what the father of Hassan had commanded. And he brought the money immediately to the Masjid as Ali ordered and the Prince of the Believers distributed alot of money every month from the

- 74 -

release of those two horns and Omar could never refuse anything commanded by the Prince of the Believers in fear of that bow and what he suffered from the Snake."

Then Mufaddal said to Imam Al Sadiq 'How many Shia and Companions were with the Prince of the Believers Ali in the time of Omar ibn Al Khattab?"

Imam Al Sadiq replied "He had with him 40 men of Uniterians and Close Ones to Allah just as there is with all the Imams."

Mufaddal said "O Master, are the 40 men one thing?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "From them are 28 of the Intelligent/Noble in every Age and Time and 12

Chiefs."

Mufaddal said "What is their limit?"

"With them the Prophets Rise and they are the ones who are called 'the Switching Ones' in the Apparent and without them O Mufaddal the Earth would have overturned with its inhabitants. And those never seperate from the Imam and they are the Stakes of the Earth and a man of them goes forth in the Earth in One day from the East to the West and then from the West to the East. And they are the Veils and their Doors and with them Allah pushes away Misfortunes from the Inhabitants of Earth."

Mufaddal said "And they are 40, without increasing or decreasing?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "They do not increase on man nor decrease a man, and they are the Preferred of Allah and His Purified and they are the Messengers of the Imam and the Earth folds for them. And they are famous for Knowledge, no one from the people of Knowledge and Knowing has the likes of what they have, they gained what they have by works and with the absence of spite from their chests! And they reached what they reached by good works so Allah dropped off of them their Apparent works with Patience and they no longer need to eat and drink. Nor do they care about the matters of this world and they came forth with their own selves to serve the Most Merciful by what He has Specialized them with from True Knowing and Affirming Godhood and Oneness to the One, Eternal, High, Most High"

Mufaddal asked "And do you see them O Master every day?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "Yes O Mufaddal, I see them and send them in the Horizons to the Nations and they are riding in chariots and they are our Preferred Ones and the Preferred Ones of the Believers."

Mufaddal said "All praises due to Allah that Guided me to Knowing them and I ask Him to bless us with catching up with them. He is Great, Able, to Him is due thanks...and Peace is the End."

**"In Knowing how long a Disbeliever remains in Maskh Incarnations after his Death and** **Killing and Slaughter"**

Mufaddal asked Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq (as) "How many Deaths and Killings and Slaughters does the Disbeliever receive in the Maskh Incarnations?"

Imam Al Sadiq replied "For the Disbeliever is 1,000 Killings and 1,000 Slaughters and 1,000

Deaths in the Maskh Incarnations."

Mufaddal asked "What is the difference between the Killing and Slaughter?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "Between them is the reason for Halal and Haram. Do you not know O

Mufaddal that not everything that is killed is not Halal to eat. And that which is slaughtered is Halal to eat. And as such if the Disbeliever rides in the Incarnations that are Halal to eat, he is slaughtered in his Incarnation. The same applies to all that is killed or dies, because the Killing is the brother of the Death for the reason of making Halal and Haram in Humans and there is another reason concerning Maskh."

Mufaddal asked "What is it O Master?"

The Imam replied "In Maskh there is the Luxurious and Spoiled and the Stressed and Tired.

And the Bestower could have widened his Livelihood and another He could have tightened his Livelihood. Some of them might be Shameful and Tightened. And of them are Strong Rebels.

Mufaddal said "I am unable to understand that O Master."

Imam Al Sadiq replied "Did you not know that of them is the knowledgable and ignorant and of them are those who lean towards Religion."

Mufaddal asked "O Master, how can one lean towards Religion when he is a Disbeliever in Maskh?"

The Imam said "The Knowledgable and Ignorant who praise Allah according to their knowledge and Knowing and Allah says in his Dear Book:

_**"There is not a thing but celebrates His praise."**_

(The Holy Qur'an 17:44)

Mufaddal asked "O Master, do they get deeds/in return for that?"

Imam Al Sadiq replied:

"Yes, they get in return their payment in this World, so if you see O Mufaddal, a Spoiled, Luxorious, rich Disbeliever. That is only due to his works in his disbelief which was of the works of the Believers so Allah gives him his reward in this World and widens his Sustenance. And He gives him health in his Body until he receives it in his World, because Allah is Just and does not do unjustice, so if he receives his reward in his human incarnations, he returns to Torture in Maskh.

So the ones you see with them of the nice life it is because of that and as for poverty and riches, that is from their works, because Allah does not waste the labor of a worker of male and female even if they went into Maskh...And if they have anything left from their works,

- 76 -

Allah gives them of the blessings that you see, fair and Just, Divisive Wisdom, Concluded Judgement, and Total Will in Worshipping the Lord of Creation and the Master of the Lord, High and Mighty is High and Big, to Him is Praises always so Praise Him Early and Late."

**"In Knowing the Lineage of the Disbeliever and what strikes him of Good and Evil and** **Poverty and Sickness and Tragedy and the reason in that"**

Mufaddal asked Imam Al Sadiq "What about the Disbeliever and their Sexual Intercourse in Maskh? And the offspring that comes from them and what strikes them from good and evil and tragedy and health and what is the cause of that?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "O Mufaddal verily from the Disbelievers are those who are Incarnated Into Maskh and of them are those who are Incarnated into Humans. And of them are those who are incarnated into Beasts and it is repayment for their works that came from them in the first Incarnation."

Mufaddal said "And how is that?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "Did you not know that from the Beasts are the Spoiled and they enjoy and die a death without any Slaughter nor any broken bones in their body.

And of them are those who are killed by broken bones and of them are those who are tortured with all kinds of tortures and many pests strike them. And as such those who are incarnated as Humans of the Disbelievers, Allah does such with them for of them are those who die a death on their bed (after) living in comfort. And of them are those who are killed and of them are those Slaughtered, and tortured with all kinds of tortures that are painstaking and tiresome in seeking sustenance. And he is in Great Torture and Painstaking Effort. And that is the difference between the Disbeliever in the image of Humans and in the image of Beasts. And the difference between him and the beasts is in the food and drink and clothing and preference between them in works. For every one who had good works (in a prior life) of praising (Allah) and Prayer and Charity, they are given in return the same of good and evil and as such in this world."

Mufaddal asked "O Master, and is there for the Disbeliever prayer and Charity and Fasting and Hajj?"

Imam Al Sadiq said "O Mufaddal, have you not seen the prayers of the Christians and their fasting and pilgrimages and likewise the Jews. And all the people of all the different religions and ways and its Triviality is Known. For of them are those who lean towards something of Good Works. And of them are those who lean towards committing Sins. For the one who leans towards the Good, he is different than the rest.”Then the Imam recited:

_**"Then anyone who has done an atom's weight of good, shall see it!**_

_**And anyone who has done an atom's weight of evil, shall see it."**_

(The Holy Qur'an 99:7-8)

Mufaddal said "O Master, this verse is about the Believers and not the Disbelievers, is it not so that the Believer is allocated from the Disbeliever's (good) works so what is the reward of the Disbelievers?"

Imam Jaf'ar al Sadiq replied "Torture is made lighter for him in the Maskh, and He is the Most Merciful of the Merciful."
