devāśca vā asurāśca | ubhaye prājāpatyāḥ paspṛdhire tato devā anuvyamivāsuratha hāsurā menire'smākamevedaṃ khalu bhuvanamiti

The gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Prajapati, were contending for superiority. Then the gods were worsted, and the Asuras thought: 'To us alone assuredly belongs this world!

te hocuḥ | hantemām pṛthivīṃ vibhajāmahai tāṃ vibhajyopajīvāmeti tāmaukṣṇaiścarmabhiḥ paścātprāñco vibhajamānā abhīyuḥ

They thereupon said: “Well then, let us divide this world between us; and having divided it, let us subsist thereon!” They accordingly set about dividing it with ox-hides from west to east.

The gods then heard of this, and said: “The Asuras are actually dividing this earth: come, let us go to where the Asuras are dividing it. For what would become of us, if we were to get no share in it?” Placing Vishnu, (in the shape of) this very sacrifice, at their head, they went (to the Asuras).

te hocuḥ | anu no'syām pṛthivyāmābhajatāstveva no'pyasyām bhāga iti te hāsurā asūyanta ivocuryāvadevaiṣa viṣnurabhiśete tāvadvo dadma iti

They then said: “Let us share in this earth along with yourselves! Let a part of it be ours!” The Asuras replied rather grudgingly: “As much as this Vishnu lies upon, and no more, we give you!”

vāmano ha viṣnurāsa | taddevā na jihīḍire mahadvai no'durye no yajñasaṃmitamaduriti

Now Vishnu was a dwarf. The gods, however, were not offended at this, but said: “Much indeed they gave us, who gave us what is equal in size to the sacrifice.”

Thereupon this Vishnu became tired; but being enclosed on all (three) sides by the metres, with the fire on the east, there was no (means of) escaping: he then hid himself among the roots of plants.

With six sacred words he draws around the first line of enclosure, with six the second: thus (together) twelvefold, for twelve no doubt are the months of the year; and the year, as Prajapati, is the sacrifice. As large as the sacrifice, as wide as its extent is, so wide does he thereby enclose it.
## 14

“Let it (the altar) measure a fathom across on the west side,” they say: that, namely, is the size of a man, and it (the altar) should be of (the) man’s size. “Three cubits long (should be) the "easterly line," for threefold is the sacrifice,” (so they say, but) in this there is no (fixed) measure: let him make it as long as he thinks fit in his own mind!

The two shoulders (of the altar) he carries along both sides of the (Ahavaniya) fire. For the altar (vedi, fem.) is female and the fire (agni, masc.) is male; and the woman lies embracing the man: thereby a copulation productive of offspring is obtained. For this reason he carries the two shoulders (of the altar) along both sides of the fire.

It should be sloping towards east, for the east is the quarter of the gods; and also sloping towards north, for the north is the quarter of men. To the south side he sweeps the rubbish (loose soil), for that is the quarter of the deceased ancestors. If it (the altar) were sloping towards south, the sacrificer would speedily go to yonder world; and thus (by making the altar in the prescribed way) the sacrificer lives for a long time: for this reason he sweeps the loose soil to the south side. Let him then cover it (the altar) over with (fresh) rubbish: for rubbish means cattle, and well-stocked with cattle he thereby makes it.

He (the Agnidhra) smooths it down (from east to west). The gods, namely, when they were preparing for the contest, said to one another: “Come, let us remove to the moon for safety what imperishable place of worship there is on this earth; so that if the Asuras, on vanquishing us, should drive us away from here, we may afterwards, by praising and mortifying, prevail again!” They accordingly removed to the moon what imperishable place of worship there was on this earth. That now is the black (spots) in the moon: hence they say, “In the moon is the place of worship for this earth.” It is in this place of worship also that his sacrifice is performed: for that reason he smooths (the altar) down

The gods thereupon said to Brihaspati Aṅgirasa, “Verily, unbelief has come upon men; ordain thou the sacrifice to them!” Brihaspati Aṅgirasa then went and said, “How comes it that you do not sacrifice?” They replied, “From a desire for what should we sacrifice, since those who sacrifice become more sinful, and those who sacrifice not become righteous?”

Brihaspati Aṅgirasa then said, “What we have heard of as produced for the gods that is this sacrifice, that is to say, the cooked oblations and the prepared altar; therewith you have performed while touching: that is why you have become more sinful. Sacrifice therefore without touching, for thus you will become righteous!” 'How long?' they asked. “Till the spreading of the sacrificial grass (on the altar),” he said. By the sacrificial grass, namely, it (the altar) becomes appeased. If, therefore, before the spreading of the sacrificial grass anything were to fall on it, let him only remove it at the time when he spreads the sacrificial grass; for when they spread the sacrificial grass, then they also step on it with the foot. He who knowing this sacrifices without touching, becomes indeed righteous: let him therefore sacrifice, without touching (the altar and oblations).

Mathava, the Videgha, was at that time on the (river) Sarasvati. He (Agni) thence went burning along this earth towards the east; and Gotama Rahugana and the Videgha Mathava followed after him as he was burning along. He burnt over (dried up) all these rivers. Now that (river), which is called 'Sadanira,' flows from the northern (Himalaya) mountain: that one he did not burn over. That one the Brahmans did not cross in former times, thinking, “it has not been burnt over by Agni Vaishvanara.”

They went on praising and toiling; for by (religious) toil, the gods indeed gained what they wished to gain, and (so did) the Rishis. Now whether it be that the gods caused it (the sacrifice) to attract (or, peep forth to) them, or whether they took to it of their own accord, they said, “Come, let us go to the place whence the gods obtained possession of the world of heaven!” They went about saying (to one another), “What attracts? What attracts?” and came upon the sacrificial cake which had become a tortoise and was creeping about. Then they all thought, “This surely must be the sacrifice!”

They said, “Stand still for the Ashvins! stand still for Sarasvati! stand still for Indra!” still it crept on;—“Stand still for Agni!” at this it stopped. Having then enveloped it in fire (Agni), knowing, as they did, that it had stopped for Agni, they Offered it up entirely, for it was an oblation to the gods. Then the sacrifice pleased them; they produced it, they spread it. And this same sacrifice is taught by the former to the later; the father (teaches it) to his son when he is a student (brahmacarin).

prajāpatirha vai svāṃ duhitaramabhidadhyau | divaṃ oṣasaṃ vā mithunyenayā syāmiti tāṃ sambabhūva

Prajapati conceived a passion for his own daughter,—either the Sky or the Dawn. “May I pair with her!” thus (thinking) he united with her.

tadvai devānāmāga āsa | ya itthaṃ svāṃ duhitaramasmākaṃ svasāraṃ karotīti

The gods then said to this god who rules over the beasts (Rudra), “This one, surely, commits a sin who acts thus towards his own daughter, our sister. Pierce him!” Rudra, taking aim, pierced him. Half of his seed fell to the ground. And thus it came to pass.

Accordingly it has been said by the Rishi with reference to that (incident), “When the father embraced his daughter, uniting with her, he dropped his seed on the earth.” This (became) the chant (uktha) called agnimaruta; in (connection with) this it is set forth how the gods caused that seed to spring. When the anger of the gods subsided, they cured Prajapati and cut out that dart of this. (Rudra); for Prajapati, doubtless, is this sacrifice.

In the morning they brought to Manu water for washing, just as now also they (are wont to) bring (water) for washing the hands. When he was washing himself, a fish came into his hands.

It said, “As long as we are small, there is great destruction for us: fish devours fish. Thou wilt first keep me in a jar. When I outgrow that, thou wilt dig a pit and keep me in it. When I outgrow that, thou wilt take me down to the sea, for then I shall be beyond destruction.”

It soon became a jhasha (a large fish); for that grows largest (of all fish). Thereupon it said, “In such and such a year that flood will come. Thou shalt then attend to me (i.e. to my advice) by preparing a ship; and when the flood has risen thou shalt enter into the ship, and I will save thee from it.”

He then puts on shoes of boar’s skin. Now the gods once put a pot of ghee on the fire. There from a boar was produced: hence the boar is fat for it was produced from ghee. Hence also cows readily take to a boar: it is indeed their own essence (life-sap, blood) they are readily taking to. Thus he firmly establishes himself in the essence of the cattle: therefore he puts on shoes of boar’s skin.

Looking down on this (earth) he then mutters, 'O mother Earth, injure me not, nor I thee!’ For the Earth was once afraid of Varuna, when he had been consecrated, thinking, ‘ Something great surely has he become now that he has been consecrated: I fear lest he may rend me asunder! And Varuna also was afraid of the Earth, thinking, I fear lest she may shake me off ! Hence by that (formula) he entered into a friendly relation with her; for a mother does not injure her son, nor does a son injure his mother.

Now this Person Prajapati desired, “May I be more (than one), may I be reproduced!” He toiled, he practised austerity. Being worn out with toil and austerity, he created first of all the Brahman (neut.), the triple science. It became to him a foundation: hence they say, “the Brahman (Veda) is the foundation of everything here.” Wherefore, having studied (the Veda) one rests on a foundation; for this, to wit, the Veda, is his foundation. Resting on that foundation, he (again) practised austerity.

He created the waters out of Vac (speech, that is) the world; for speech belonged to it: that was created (set free). It pervaded everything here; and because it pervaded (ap) whatsoever there was here, therefore (it is called) water (apah); and because it covered (var), therefore also it (is called) water (var).

He desired, “May I be reproduced from these waters!” He entered the waters with that triple science. Thence an egg arose. He touched it. “Let it exist! let it exist and multiply!” so he said. From it the Brahman (neut.) was first created, the triple science. Hence they say, “The Brahman (n.) is the first-born of this All.” For even before that Person the Brahman was created: it was created as his mouth. Hence they say of him who has studied the Veda, that 'he is like Agni;' for it, the Brahman (Veda), is Agni’s mouth.

Now the embryo which was inside was created as the foremost (agri): inasmuch as it was created foremost (agram) of this All, therefore (it is called) Agri: Agri, indeed, is he whom they mystically call Agni; for the gods love the mystic. And the tear (ashru, n.) which had formed itself became the 'ashru' (m.): “ashru” indeed is what they mystically call 'ashva' (horse), for the gods love the mystic. And that which, as it were, cried (ras), became the ass (rasabha). And the juice which was adhering to the shell (of the egg) became the he-goat (aja). And that which was the shell became the earth.

And, again, why the Vishnu-strides and the Vatsapra rite are (performed);—by the Vishnu-strides Prajapati created this world, and by the Vatsapra the fire (Agni); by the Vishnu-strides Prajapati created the air, and by the Vatsapra the wind (Vayu); by the Vishnu-strides Prajapati created the sky, and by the Vatsapra the sun (Aditya); by the Vishnu-strides Prajapati created the regions, and by the Vatsapra the moon; by the Vishnu-strides Prajapati created that which has been, and by the Vatsapra that which shall be; by the Vishnu-strides Prajapati created possession (wealth), and by the Vatsapra hope; by the Vishnu-strides Prajapati created the day, and by the Vatsapra the night; by the Vishnu-strides Prajapati created the former (bright) fortnights, and by the Vatsapra the latter (dark) fortnights; by the Vishnu-strides Prajapati created the half-months, and by the Vatsapra the months; by the Vishnu-strides Prajapati created the seasons, and by the Vatsapra the year: thus the reason why the Vishnu-strides and Vatsapra are (performed) is that he thereby even now creates everything.

And, again, why the Vishnu-strides and the Vatsapra rite are (performed). By the Vishnu-strides Prajapati drove up to heaven. He saw that unyoking-place, the Vatsapra, and unyoked thereat to prevent chafing; for when the yoked (beast) is not unloosed, it is chafed. In like manner the Sacrificer drives up to heaven by the Vishnu-strides; and unyokes by means of the Vatsapra.

He then puts down a (living) tortoise;—the tortoise means life-sap: it is life-sap (blood) he thus bestows on (Agni). This tortoise is that life-sap of these worlds which flowed away from them when plunged into the waters: that (life-sap) he now bestows on (Agni). As far as the life-sap extends, so far the body extends: that (tortoise) thus is these worlds.

I, 90, 6-8) “Honey the winds pour forth for the righteous, honey the rivers; full of honey may the plants be for us!—Honey by night and morn, rich in honey may the region of the earth be for us, honey the father Heaven!—rich in honey may the tree be for us, rich in honey the sun, full of honey the kine!” To whatever deity a Rik-verse, and to whatever (deity) a Yajus formula applies, that very deity the verse is, and that very deity the sacrificial formula is. This triplet then is honey (madhu); and honey being life-sap, it is life-sap he thus puts into him (Agni). With three Gayatri verses (he performs): the significance of this has been explained.

And as to its being called 'kurma' (tortoise);Prajapati, having assumed that form, created living beings. Now what he created, he made; and inasmuch as he made (kar), he is (called) “kurma;” and 'kurma' being (the same as) “kashyapa” (a tortoise), therefore all creatures are said to be descended from Kashyapa.

And as to why he lays down those Asapatnas. Now at that time, when that (part) of his body had been restored, evil beset Prajapati on every side. He saw those foeless bricks, and laid them down, and by means of them he drove off evil, for foe means evil; and because, by means of them he drove off the foe, evil, therefore they are (called) “foeless” (bricks).

saṃvatsaro vai prajāpatiragniḥ somo rājā candramāḥ sa ha svayamevātmānam proce yajñavacase rājastambāyanāya yāvanti vāva me jyotīṃṣi tāvatyo ma iṣṭakā iti

Verily, Prajapati, the year, is Agni, and King Soma, the moon. He himself, indeed, proclaimed (taught) his own self to Yajnavacas Rajastambayana, saying, “As many lights as there are of mine, so many are my bricks.”

tasya vā etasya saṃvatsarasya prajāpateḥ sapta ca śatāni viṃśatiścāhorātrāṇi jyotīṃṣi tā iṣṭakāḥ ṣaṣṭiśca trīṇi ca śatāṇi pariśritaḥ ṣaṣṭiśca trīṇi ca śatāni yajuṣmatyaḥ so'yaṃ saṃvatsaraḥ prajāpatiḥ sarvāṇi bhūtāni sasṛje yacca prāṇi yaccāprāṇamubhayāndevamanuṣyāntsa sarvāṇi bhūtāni sṛṣṭvā riricāna-iva mene sa mṛtyorbibhayāṃ cakāra

Now in this Prajapati, the year, there are seven hundred and twenty days and nights, his lights, (being) those bricks; three hundred and sixty enclosing-stones, and three hundred and sixty bricks with (special) formulas. This Prajapati, the year, has created all existing things, both what breathes and the breathless, both gods and men. Having created all existing things, he felt like one emptied out, and was afraid of death.

sa hekṣāṃ cakre kathaṃ nvahamināni sarvāṇi bhūtāni punarātmannāvapeya punarātmandadhīya kathaṃ nvahamevaiṣāṃ sarveṣām bhūtānām punarātmā syāmiti

He bethought himself, “How can I get these beings back into my body? how can I put them back into my body? how can I be again the body of all these beings?”

atha yaccaturviṃśatimātmano'kuruta tasmāccaturviṃśatyardhamāsaḥ saṃvatsaraḥ sa etaiścaturviṃśatyā triṃśadiṣṭakairātmabhirna vyabhavatsa pañcadaśāhno rūpāṇyapaśyadātmanastanvo muhūrtālokampṛṇāḥ pañcadaśaiva rātrestadyanmuhu trāyante tasmānmuhurtā atha yatkṣudrāḥ santa imāṃlokānāpūrayanti tasmāllokampṛṇāḥ

18} And because he made himself twenty-four bodies, therefore the year consists of twenty-four half-months. With these twenty-four bodies of thirty bricks each he had not developed (sufficiently). He saw the fifteen parts of the day, the muhurtas, as forms for his body, as space-fillers (Lokamprinas), as well as fifteen of the night; and inasmuch as they straightway (muhu) save (trai), they are (called) “muhurtah”; and inasmuch as, whilst being small, they fill (pur) these worlds (or spaces, “loka”) they are (called) “lokamprinah.”

Now, Shvetaketu Aruneya, who knew this, said once, “To him who will thus know that glory of the fore-offerings, people will in days to come be flocking from all sides as if wishing to see some great serpent.”

By means of the Surâ-liquor Namuki, the Asura, carried off Indra's (source of) strength, the essence of food, the Soma-drink. He (Indra) hasted up to the Asvins and Sarasvatî, crying, 'I have sworn to Namuki, saying, "I will slay thee neither by day nor by night, neither with staff nor with bow, neither with the palm of my hand nor with the fist, neither with the dry nor with the moist!" and yet has he taken these things from me: seek ye to bring me back these things!

And on the eighth day, after those (three) offerings have been performed in the same way, there is the same course of procedure. “Adhvaryu!” he (the Hotri) says.—“Havai hotar!” replies the Adhvaryu.—“King Matsya Sammada,” he says; 'his people are the water-dwellers, and they are staying here;'—both fish and fishermen have come thither: it is these he instructs;—“the Itihasa 3 is the Veda: this it is;” thus saying, let him tell some Itihasa. The Adhvaryu calls in the same way (on the masters of lute-players), but does not perform the Prakrama oblations.

Purusha Narayana desired, “Would that I overpassed all beings! would that I alone were everything here (this universe)!” He beheld this five-days’ sacrificial performance, the Purushamedha, and took it, and performed offering therewith; and having performed offering therewith, he overpassed all beings, and became everything here. And, verily, he who, knowing this, performs the Purushamedha, or who even knows this, overpasses all beings, and becomes everything here.

And, again, as to why there are (the victims) of the set of eleven (stakes): it is for the sake of his obtaining and securing everything, for the set of eleven (stakes) is everything, since the set of eleven (stakes) is Prajapati, and Prajapati is everything, and the Purushamedha is everything.

Then (earth) torn up by a boar (he takes), with 'Only thus large was she in the beginning,'--for, indeed, only so large was this earth in the beginning, of the size of a span. A boar, called Emûsha, raised her up, and he was her lord Prajapati: with that mate, his heart's delight, he thus supplies and completes him;--'may I this day compass for you Makha's head on the Earth's place of divine worship: for Makha thee! for Makha's head thee!'
