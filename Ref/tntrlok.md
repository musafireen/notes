"tantraprakriyā ritual emphasized the external worship of the liṅga, visiting tantric holy places ( pīṭha s) and offering substances into a consecrated fire ( hautrī dīkṣā), the kulaprakriyā practice featured an internalized liṅga as the bodily axis mundi, the pīṭha s were identified with the body, the hautrī dīkṣā became a fireless internalized form of the ritual, and so on (TĀ 4.258–275; Sanderson 2005, 117–122; Törzsök 2007, 473–479)" (.)

"Abhinavagupta offers an esoteric interpretation of the liṅga as being unmanifest where it is equated with absolute consciousness or the “supreme heart of tranquility” ( viśrāntihṛdayam param), manifest-unmanifest ( vyaktāvyakta) when identified with the body, and manifest ( vyakta) as an outer symbol (TA 5 117a)" (.)

"Trika goddesses were so powerful that they must be placated with offerings of blood and alcohol, only after which could ordinary offerings of flowers and incense be made (TA 26.51c–53b from Sanderson 1995, 81)" (.)

"Through commentaries on specific tantric scriptures ( tantraśāstra), Abhinavagupta and the Śākta-Śaiva theologians of the Trika school developed a sophisticated scholastic basis for Kaula worship. This included a public version of the tantraprakriyā for householders, while kulaprakriyā initiates continued to practice the original Kula and Kaula rituals in secret, including the sexualized rituals and consumption of impure substances (TĀ 29; Dupuche 2003)" (.)

"suitable person ( adhikārin) the supererogatory rite of the kula-prakriyā was possible in order to achieve gradual perfection ( siddhikrama) which would otherwise take thousands of years with floods of mantras (TA 29.1–3).

"tenth-century Kashmiri theologian Abhinavagupta, likewise traces the guru lineage of the esoteric “family” ( kula) tradition to the four mythical figures, the Lords Khagendra, Kūrma, Meṣa, and Macchanda, and thence to Śiva (TA 29.29– 32" (.)
## 97-98
This kula prakriya rite involved making offerings of meat, wine and sex (TA 29.97–98), 
## 115-117
meat, wine and sex were ritually anathema to the orthoprax brahmin, with a partner or “messenger” ( dūtī) who was regarded as the Sādhaka’s “door” ( dvāra) to realizing the wonder ( camatkāra) of pure consciousness (TA 29.115b–117; Silburn 1988, 219; Flood 2002, 281–301; Dupuche 2003). 

The Sādhaka and his ritual partner thereby recapitulated the union ( yāmala) of Śiva and his female power or Śakti and the pleasure of their union reflected the universal joy ( jagadānanda) of liberation. The deities in these esoteric levels of the Trika and Krama demanded to be appeased by impure substances, such as offerings which included drops of the five substances, urine, semen, menstrual blood, feces, and phlegm, along with other substances polluting to the brahmin such as garlic and onions (Sanderson 1995, 82)" (.)

"tenth-century Tantrāloka:
The Kula resides within the [Śaiva] scriptures like the scent in a flower, the oil in a sesame seed, the soul in the body, or the nectar of life in water. (TĀ 35.34, tr. Sanderson 2005, 107)" (.)
