svabhāvam eke kavayo vadanti kālaṃ tathānye parimuhyamānāḥ /  
devasyaiṣa mahimā tu loke yenedaṃ bhrāmyate brahmacakram // 6.1 //

Some learned men speak of the inherent nature of things and some speak of time, as the cause of the universe. They all, indeed, are deluded. It is the greatness of the self-luminous Lord that causes the Wheel of Brahman to revolve.

yenāvṛtaṃ nityam idaṃ hi sarvaṃ jñaḥ kālakālo guṇī sarvavidyaḥ /  
teneśitaṃ karma vivartate ha pṛthivyāptejo'nilakhāni cintyam // 6.2 //

He by whom the whole universe is constantly pervaded, who is the knowledge itself, the Author of time who is sinless and omniscient, at whose command the work which is called earth, water, fire, air and akasa appears as the universe, on Him the wise should reflect upon.

tat karma kṛtvā vinivartya bhūyas tattvasya tattvena sametya yogam /  
ekena dvābhyāṃ tribhir aṣṭabhir vā kālena caivātmaguṇaiś ca sūkṣmaiḥ // 6.3 //

The yogi who first performs actions and then turns away from them and who practises one, two, three, or eight disciplines, unites one principle with another principle and with the help of virtues cultivated by the self and of subtle tendencies attains Liberation in course of time.

ārabhya karmāṇi guṇānvitāni bhāvāṃś ca sarvān viniyojayed yaḥ /  
teṣām abhāve kṛtakarmanāśaḥ karmakṣaye yāti sa tattvato 'nyaḥ // 6.4 //

He who attains purity of heart by performing actions as an offering to the Lord and merges prakriti and all its effects in Brahman, realizes his true Self and thereby transcends phenomena. In the absence of maya, both collective and individual, all his past actions are destroyed. After the destruction of the prarabdha karma he attains final Liberation.

ādiḥ sa saṃyoganimittahetuḥ paras trikālād akalo 'pi dṛṣṭaḥ /  
taṃ viśvarūpaṃ bhavabhūtam īḍyaṃ devaṃ svacittastham upāsya pūrvam // 6.5 //

The Great Lord is the beginning, the cause which unites the soul with the body; He is above the three kinds of time and is seen to be without parts. After having worshipped that adorable God dwelling in the heart, who is of many forms and is the true source of all things, man attains final Liberation.

sa vṛkṣakālākṛtibhiḥ paro 'nyo yasmāt prapañcaḥ parivartate 'yaṃ /  
dharmāvahaṃ pāpanudaṃ bhageśaṃ jñātvātmastham amṛtaṃ viśvadhāma // 6.6 //

He from whom this universe proceeds is higher and other than all forms of the Tree of the World and of time. When one knows Him who is the indweller, the bringer of good, the destroyer of evil, the Lord of powers, the immortal support of all, one attains final Liberation.

tam īśvarāṇāṃ paramaṃ maheśvaraṃ taṃ devatānāṃ paramaṃ ca daivataṃ /  
patiṃ patīnāṃ paramaṃ parastād vidāma devaṃ bhuvaneśam īḍyam // 6.7 //

We know Him who is the Supreme Lord of lords, the Supreme Deity of deities, the Ruler of rulers; who is higher than the imperishable prakriti and is the self-luminous, adorable Lord of the world.

## 6.8
na tasya kāryaṃ karaṇaṃ ca vidyate na tatsamaś cābhyadhikaś ca dṛśyate /  
parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate svābhāvikī jñānabalakriyā ca // 6.8 //

He is without a body or organs; none like unto Him is seen, or better than He. The Vedas speak of His parā śakti, which is innate and capable of producing diverse effects and also of His omniscience and might.

## 6.9

na tasya kaścit patir asti loke na ceśitā naiva ca tasya liṅgaṃ /  
sa kāraṇaṃ karaṇādhipādhipo na cāsya kaścij janitā na cādhipaḥ // 6.9 //

He has no master in the world, no ruler, nor is there even a sign of Him by which He can be inferred. He is the cause, the Lord of the lord of the organs; and He is without progenitor or controller.

## 6.10
yas tantunābha iva tantubhiḥ pradhānajaiḥ svabhāvataḥ /  
deva ekaḥ svam āvṛṇoti sa no dadhād brahmāpyayam // 6.10 //

May the non-dual Lord, who, by the power of His maya, covered Himself, like a spider, with threads drawn from primal matter, merge us in Brahman!

eko devaḥ sarvabhūteṣu gūḍhaḥ sarvavyāpī sarvabhūtāntarātmā /  
karmādhyakṣaḥ sarvabhūtādhivāsaḥ sākṣī cetā kevalo nirguṇaś ca // 6.11 //

The non-dual and resplendent Lord is hidden in all beings. All-pervading, the inmost Self of all creatures, the impeller to actions, abiding in all things, He is the Witness, the Animator and the Absolute, free from gunas.

eko vaśī niṣkriyāṇāṃ bahūṇām ekaṃ bījaṃ bahudhā yaḥ karoti /  
tam ātmasthaṃ ye 'nupaśyanti dhīrās teṣāṃ sukhaṃ śāśvataṃ netareṣāṃ // 6.12 //

There is a non-dual Ruler of the actionless many; He makes the one seed manifold. Eternal happiness belongs to the wise, who perceive Him within themselves-and not to others.

## 6.13

nityo nityānāṃ cetanaś cetanānām eko bahūnāṃ yo vidadhāti kāmān /  
tat kāraṇaṃ sāṃkhyayogādhigamyaṃ jñātvā devaṃ mucyate sarvapāśaiḥ // 6.13 //

He is the Eternal among the eternal, the Conscious among the conscious and though non-dual, fulfils the desires of many. He who has known Him, the luminous Lord, the Great Cause, to be realized by Knowledge (Samkhya) and yoga, is freed from all fetters.

na tatra sūryo bhāti na candratārakaṃ nemā vidyuto bhānti kuto 'yam agniḥ /  
tam eva bhāntam anubhāti sarvaṃ tasya bhāsā sarvam idaṃ vibhāti // 6.14 //

The sun does not shine there, nor the moon and the stars, nor these lightnings-much less this fire. He shining, everything shines after Him. By his light all this is lighted.

eko haṃso bhuvanasyāsya madhye sa evāgniḥ salile saṃniviṣṭaḥ /  
tam eva viditvāti mṛtyum eti nānyaḥ panthā vidyate 'yanāya // 6.15 //

In this universe the Swan, the Supreme Self alone exists. It is He who, as fire, abides in the water. Only by knowing Him does one pass over death, there is no other way to reach the Supreme Goal.

## 6.16

sa viśvakṛd viśvavid ātmayonir jñaḥ kālakālo guṇī sarvavidyaḥ /  
pradhānakṣetrajñapatir guṇeśaḥ saṃsāramokṣasthitibandhahetuḥ // 6.16 //

He who is the support of both the unmanifested prakriti and the jiva, who is the Lord of the three gunas and who is the cause of bondage, existence and Liberation from samsara, is verily the Creator of the universe, the Knower, the inmost Self of all things and their Source-the omniscient Lord, the Author of time, the Possessor of virtues, the Knower of everything.

sa tanmayo hy amṛta īśasaṃstho jñaḥ sarvago bhuvanasyāsya goptā /  
sa īśe asya jagato nityam eva nānyo hetur vidyata īśanāya // 6.17 //

He who constantly rules the world is verily the cause of bondage and Liberation. Established in His own glory, He is the Immortal, the Embodiment of Consciousness, and the omnipresent Protector of the universe. There is no one else able to rule it.

## 6.18

यो ब्रह्माणं विदधाति पूर्वं यो वै वेदांश्च प्रहिणोति तस्मै ।
तं ह देवं आत्मबुद्धिप्रकाशं मुमुक्षुर्वै शरणमहं प्रपद्ये ॥१८॥

yo brahmāṇaṃ vidadhāti pūrvaṃ yo vai vedāṃś ca prahiṇoti tasmai /  
taṃ ha devam ātmabuddhiprakāśaṃ mumukṣur vai śaraṇam ahaṃ prapadye // 6.18 //

Seeking Liberation, I take refuge in the Lord, the revealer of Self-Knowledge, who in the beginning created Brahma and delivered the Vedas to Him.

niṣkalaṃ niṣkriyaṃ śāntaṃ niravadyaṃ nirañjanam /  
amṛtasya paraṃ setuṃ dagdhendhanam ivānalam // 6.19 //

yadā carmavad ākāśaṃ veṣṭayiṣyanti mānavāḥ /  
tadā devam avijñāya duḥkhasyānto bhaviṣyati // 6.20 //

When men shall roll up space as if it were a piece of hide, then there will be an end of misery without one’s cultivating the Knowledge of the Lord, who is without parts, without actions, tranquil, blameless, unattached, the supreme bridge to Immortality, and like a fire that has consumed all its fuel.

## 6.21
tapaḥprabhāvād devaprasādāt brahma ha śvetāśvataro 'tha vidvān /  
atyāśramibhyaḥ paramaṃ pavitraṃ provāca samyag ṛṣisaṅghajuṣṭam // 6.21 //

Through the power of austerity and through the grace of the Lord, the sage Svetasvatara realised Brahman and proclaimed the highly sacred Knowledge, supremely cherished by the company of seers, to sannyasins of the most advanced stage.

## 6.22-23

vedānte paramaṃ guhyaṃ purākalpe pracoditam /  
nāpraśāntāya dātavyaṃ nāputrāyāśiṣyāya vā punaḥ // 6.22 //

The profound mystery in the Vedanta was taught in the previous cycle. It should not be given to one whose passions have not been subdued, or to one who is not a son or a disciple.

yasya deve parā bhaktir yathā deve tathā gurau /  
tasyaite kathitā hy arthāḥ prakāśante mahātmanaḥ prakāśante mahātmanaḥ // 6.23 //

If these truths have been told to a high-minded person who feels the highest devotion for God and for his guru as for God, and then they will surely shine forth as inner experiences - then, indeed, they will shine forth.
