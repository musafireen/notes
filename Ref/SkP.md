After recounting the invincibility of the wicked Daitya in the guise of a buffalo by means of his Māyā all the seven Mothers eulogized Goddess Durgā thus:

##### 53
“O Goddess, you lie concealed within the lotus-like eyes of Viṣṇu in the form of Yoganidrā (‘transcendental Yogic slumber’) sportfully like a honey-bee.
##### 55
If you had not been born as Kauśikī bringing about the death of Śuṃbha and Niśuṃbha, O Goddess, how could the glory and prosperity of the Guardians of Quarters have been regained?
##### 56
O Vindhyavāsinī (‘Resident of Vindhya’), what fruitful penance has been performed by Vindhya where a friendship with you can be acquired even by the Kirātīs (‘huntresses’)!

46-57. After eulogizing me, he made this statement: “The earliest Devas named Tuṣitas have been deprived of their bodies by Bhadrakālī, O Mahādeva. The Vasus have been overpowered and shattered, the Bhāskaras have been injured in the battle. The remaining ones have fled in various directions. How shall the Kāyāvarohaṇa (growing of the body once again) of the Tuṣitas take place?”

On hearing the words of Brahmā, O lady of excellent countenance, I said: “Let these Tuṣitas go to the holy spot Mahākālavana where Lakuṭīśa [Lakulīśa] has gone home after Kāyāvarohaṇa.[1] At my bidding the Brāhmaṇas, accompanied by four disciples, attained the Kāyās when Kaliyuga arrived after Dvāpara was over. All these are my disciples and comparable to me. They stayed on the earth contented and blessed for the purpose of protecting Brāhmaṇas. To the south of that Kṣetra (holy spot) there is an excellent Liṅga. It is divine and it bestows all riches. It accords Kāyā unto the Siddhas. With the favour of that Liṅga, these Suras will attain their Kāyās.” On hearing my words, O my beloved, those Tuṣitas went away delighted in the company of Brahmā to the place where the excellent Liṅga was present. With the favour of that Liṅga, excellent Kāyās were attained by them. Those Tuṣitas became the same as they were before. Hence the name Kāyāvarohaṇeśvara was given by the Devas. The deity shall be bestower of desired things and will be well-known. If the devotees go to the southern quarter and visit the deity Kāyāvarohaṇa with great devotion, Yama shall be their father (a protecting guardian). By visiting it alone, all those sins acquired in the course of thousands and crores of births become dissolved, not otherwise.

वेदवन्निश्चलं मन्ये पुराणार्थं द्विजोत्तमाः 

O best of the brahmanas, the meaning of the Puranas is unchanging just like that of the Vedas. 

वेदाः प्रतिष्ठिताः सर्वे पुराणे नात्र संशयः

The Vedas are all sheltered within the Puranas without a doubt. 
#### 122
बिभेत्यल्पश्रुताद्वेदो मां अयमं चलयिष्यति 

The Veda has a fear that unqualified people will read her and then distort her meaning. 

इतिहासपुराणैस्तु निश्चलो ऽयं कृतः पुरा

Thus, the significance of the Veda was fixed in the Puranas and Itihasas. 
#### 123
यन्न दृष्टं हि वेदेषु तद्दृष्टं स्मृतिषु द्विजाः 

That which is not found in the Vedas is found in the Smrti. 

उभयोर्यन्न दृष्टं हि तत् पुरानैः प्रगीयते

That which is not found in the Smrti is to be found in the Puranas. 
#### 124
यो वेद चतुरो वेदान् साङ्गोपनिषदो द्विजाः पुराणं नैव जानाति न च स स्याद्विचक्षनः

Those who know even the Vedas and Upanisads are not learned if they do not know the Puranas.
