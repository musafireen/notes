##### 52
After recounting the invincibility of the wicked Daitya in the guise of a buffalo by means of his Māyā all the seven Mothers eulogized Goddess Durgā thus:

##### 53
“O Goddess, you lie concealed within the lotus-like eyes of Viṣṇu in the form of Yoganidrā (‘transcendental Yogic slumber’) sportfully like a honey-bee.
##### 55
If you had not been born as Kauśikī bringing about the death of Śuṃbha and Niśuṃbha, O Goddess, how could the glory and prosperity of the Guardians of Quarters have been regained?
##### 56
O Vindhyavāsinī (‘Resident of Vindhya’), what fruitful penance has been performed by Vindhya where a friendship with you can be acquired even by the Kirātīs (‘huntresses’)!

#### 121
वेदवन्निश्चलं मन्ये पुराणार्थं द्विजोत्तमाः 

O best of the brahmanas, the meaning of the Puranas is unchanging just like that of the Vedas. 

वेदाः प्रतिष्ठिताः सर्वे पुराणे नात्र संशयः

The Vedas are all sheltered within the Puranas without a doubt. 
#### 122
बिभेत्यल्पश्रुताद्वेदो मां अयमं चलयिष्यति 

The Veda has a fear that unqualified people will read her and then distort her meaning. 

इतिहासपुराणैस्तु निश्चलो ऽयं कृतः पुरा

Thus, the significance of the Veda was fixed in the Puranas and Itihasas. 
#### 123
यन्न दृष्टं हि वेदेषु तद्दृष्टं स्मृतिषु द्विजाः 

That which is not found in the Vedas is found in the Smrti. 

उभयोर्यन्न दृष्टं हि तत् पुरानैः प्रगीयते

That which is not found in the Smrti is to be found in the Puranas. 
#### 124
यो वेद चतुरो वेदान् साङ्गोपनिषदो द्विजाः पुराणं नैव जानाति न च स स्याद्विचक्षनः

Those who know even the Vedas and Upanisads are not learned if they do not know the Puranas.
