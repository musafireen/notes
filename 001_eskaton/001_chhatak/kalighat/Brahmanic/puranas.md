   - **Location**: Northern India, possibly centered around regions like Uttar Pradesh or Bihar, where Vaishnavism was gaining traction.
   - **Political Patronage**: This period aligns with Gupta rulers such as **Chandragupta II** and **Kumaragupta I**, who were ardent Vaishnavas. The Gupta kings promoted the ideology of divine kingship, where the king was seen as Vishnu’s earthly representative.
   - **Sectarian Influence**: The earliest sections focus on **Vishnu as the preserver of cosmic order (dharma)**. This layer emphasizes the story of **Vamana’s incarnation to subdue the demon king Bali**, a narrative that symbolizes Vishnu’s role in restoring dharma. It likely served to legitimize Vaishnava-aligned rulers by promoting the idea of divine kingship, with the king as Vishnu’s agent on earth.

   - **Political Patronage**: Local rulers or dynasties who sought to emulate Gupta religious and political practices may have patronized the expansion of the text. The post-Gupta period saw regional rulers adopting elements of Gupta ideology to assert their legitimacy.
   - **Sectarian Influence**: This layer is more explicitly **Vaishnava** in its sectarian tone, expanding on Vishnu’s avatars and their roles in upholding dharma. This period also reflects **greater influence of Bhakti elements** within Vaishnavism, as the devotional approach toward Vishnu grew popular.

   - **Sectarian Influence**: This layer incorporates **Shaiva elements** in a manner that coexists with Vaishnavism, reflecting the socio-religious syncretism of the period. It attempts to **soften the exclusivity of Vishnu worship** by presenting other deities, such as Shiva, in a more integrated framework.
   - **Content**: Sections that **praise Shiva and acknowledge other deities** were likely introduced to make the text more acceptable to a wider audience, where Shaiva worship had significant followings. This is consistent with a broader cultural trend where religious texts attempted to bridge Vaishnava and Shaiva traditions.

-  **Final Redactions and Bhakti Influence (11th–12th century CE)**

   - **Political Patronage**: **Rajput dynasties**, **Chalukyas**, and other regional powers may have contributed to the preservation and transmission of this Purana, aligning it with the devotional ethos of the time.
   - **Sectarian Influence**: The final layer reflects **mature Bhakti theology**, emphasizing **personal devotion (bhakti)** to Vishnu and the worship of Vishnu in forms that appeal to popular devotion, rather than simply royal ideology.
   - **Content**: The text would have gained **devotional hymns and prayers**, as well as more detailed stories of Vishnu’s mercy and grace. The integration of Bhakti concepts reflects the spread of a more inclusive Vaishnavism that transcended elite audiences and aimed at broader social appeal.
