The incorporation of indigenous deities into Brahmanical (later known as Hindu) canon was a gradual and complex process that took place over several centuries. While there is no definitive list of texts that exemplify this process, here are some examples of Indian texts and indigenous deities that are associated with the incorporation of indigenous traditions into the Brahmanical canon:

1. The Vedas: The Vedas, a collection of ancient Hindu texts, are often cited as an early example of the incorporation of indigenous deities into Brahmanical canon. Some of the Vedic deities, such as Indra, Agni, and Soma, are thought to have been originally associated with indigenous cultures.

2. The Mahabharata: The Mahabharata, one of the two major Hindu epics, tells the story of a great war between two branches of a royal family. The Mahabharata includes references to many indigenous deities and traditions, including the worship of the goddess Durga by the Kolarian tribes of eastern India.

3. The Ramayana: The Ramayana, the other major Hindu epic, tells the story of the prince Rama and his quest to rescue his wife Sita from the demon king Ravana. The Ramayana also includes references to indigenous deities and traditions, such as the worship of the monkey god Hanuman.

4. The Puranas: The Puranas, a group of Hindu texts that date back to around 500 CE, include many stories about the incorporation of indigenous deities into the Brahmanical canon. For example, the story of Ganesha, the elephant-headed god, is often associated with the incorporation of the Gana tribes of western India into Hinduism.

5. The Tamil devotional literature: The Tamil devotional literature, a collection of Hindu texts that date back to around 300 BCE, often includes references to local deities and spirits that were worshipped by indigenous communities in southern India before they were incorporated into the Brahmanical canon.

6. The Arthashastra: The Arthashastra, a Sanskrit text on statecraft and governance, includes references to indigenous deities and traditions. For example, it discusses the use of shamanic practices by forest-dwelling tribes and the importance of incorporating these practices into the state religion.

It's important to note that the incorporation of indigenous deities into Brahmanical canon was not always straightforward, and there was often resistance from both the indigenous communities and the Brahmanical establishment. Nonetheless, over time, many indigenous deities became an integral part of the Hindu pantheon.
