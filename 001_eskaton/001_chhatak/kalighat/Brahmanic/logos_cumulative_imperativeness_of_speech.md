It isn't coincidence that the rise of the concept of the creative logos coincided with the rise of the most influencial emperors (imperators/commander)

All sentences whether imperative or non-imperative add up to imperative sentences.

When I tell you some food is poisonous. It combines with the intuition in you that poison is bad for you, to produce the same effect as the imperative sentence "don't eat this food". 

That intuition "you shouldn't do something that is bad for you", and your previous knowledge that "poison IS bad for you", also each has the same effect as some other speech (namely the two in quotation).

All speech is like this. The value of speech is how much they contribute to the realization of the consequence. The value of speech is pragmatic. Not in its truth value.

Not all speech have their intended action or prohibition realized immediately after the speech.

More importantly, not all speech have the consequence of the speech preconceived in the mind of the one making the speech.

Think of it like a bureaucracy. We are all passing down information or partial commands to others without knowing the final consequence.

What if there is someone who is passing down all the stimuli we receive that move us into action, in whose mind the consequence of those stimuli are preconceived.

Now consider the previous example:

I had to tell you that some food is poisonous and that combinined with your previous knowledge that poison is bad for you, and intuition that.

Now think of another person who doesn't need to be told which food is poisionous. Who never needed to learn that poison is bad for them. But they just intuitively know that the same food is bad for them. Maybe they are genetically wired to stay away from it.

Now, between the system by which you stay away from the poisonous food and by which this genetically wired individual does the same, which is better.

Now the answer may vary from person to person by their philosophies.

Suppose for a second everyone received one single instantaneous programming that made them do everything the best way that they can so that no evil is done wouldn't it be better than constantly researching, looking for information as to what the right course of action is.

If God were to act like that and send such messages to anyone which the prophets claim to have received, we wouldn't be able to tell the difference.
