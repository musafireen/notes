Here are the original lines from the examples I mentioned earlier, which mention Mahachina or Mahacina:

4. The Mahabharata (date uncertain), Book 2, Section 9 (in Sanskrit):

"उत्तरस्यां दिशि चीनाद्रिर्दक्षिणस्यां यवनः।
पञ्चमः सोऽयमेतेषां विभागः पृथिवीतले॥"

Translation: "To the north [of Jambudvipa] is the region of Chinapada, and to the south is that of the Yavanas. This is the fifth division of the earth."


5. The Arthashastra (3rd century BCE), Book 2, Chapter 1 (in Sanskrit):

"चीनैर्वनिजतावपि स्नातव्यम्"

Translation: "One should have trade relations even with China."


2. The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea - This is a Greek text from the 1st century CE that describes trade routes and ports along the Red Sea and Indian Ocean coasts. It mentions the port of Kalliena (possibly modern-day Kalyan in Maharashtra) as a center for the trade in Chinese goods, including silk and porcelain.

Original text: "Beyond these places there is the harbor of Kalliena, from which, they say, silk is brought to Egypt, the voyage being made in forty days and across desert country for six days."

Translation: "Further on is the port of Kalliena, from which silk is said to come to Egypt. The voyage takes forty days, and for six days it is across a desert."

3. The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea (1st century CE), chapter 22 (in Greek):

"Kalliena is the next port, lying in a deep bay; and opposite this lies a small island. Here the men of Musiris anchor their large ships, for there are no docks; they simply tie up along the shore. On the other hand, they make use of a smaller vessel, which they call trappaga, for river navigation, as well as for short stretches of sea travel. The cargo they unload here includes, among other things, a great deal of coin, Indian iron, and thin clothing. There is also brought here a great deal of the wine of sweet and sour grapes, manufactured in the neighbourhood of Barygaza, and a little further on a great quantity of sesame oil and clarified butter. The imports consist of unrefined sugar, olive oil, and wine. On the same sea-coast there are other harbours, such as that of Calliana and that of Barygaza, which are very large and situated in the midst of peoples speaking foreign tongues, many of them of the Mahajanapadas."

Note: The reference to Mahachina is in the last sentence, where the text mentions the presence of people from the Mahajanapadas, which included parts of India as well as neighboring regions such as Mahachina.


3. The Milindapanha, a Pali text dating to the 1st century BCE or 1st century CE, contains a dialogue between the Indo-Greek king Menander and a Buddhist sage named Nagasena. In this dialogue, Menander mentions his encounters with Chinese merchants and describes the Chinese as a people who are "rich in gold and silver."

Original text: "āsiṃ cāhaṃ, bhante, acirapakkantassa cīnapaññāsassa sālakāya saṃvijjamānassa ārakā evaṃ suvibhajitā honti: sone vā sīse vā"


2. The Divyavadana, a collection of Buddhist tales in Sanskrit dating to the 2nd or 3rd century CE, mentions a king of Mahachina who was converted to Buddhism by the Buddha's disciple, Mahamaudgalyayana.

Original text: "atha khalu khalu mahācīne rājā nāma mahābāhuḥ prabhāvitavān vartate"


1. The Mahavamsa - This is a historical text from Sri Lanka that was written in Pali in the 5th century CE. It mentions a delegation of monks from Mahachina who visited Sri Lanka during the reign of King Dappula in the 7th century CE. 

Original text: "tayo rattiyo mahācīnā dhammadesanāya nivattitvā te therā bhikkhusaṅghassa kathāmukhaṃ sādhukaṃ suṇiṃsu" 

Translation: "After three nights, the monks from Mahachina returned from preaching the Dharma and heard a good discourse in the presence of the monks."

1. The Mahavamsa (5th century CE), chapter 29, verses 44-47 (in Pali):

"Pabbajitānaṃ dve bhikkhū, Mahācīnaṃ pavisitā,
Tepi Buddhasirīmantā, sārīrikā dhammadesanā."

Translation: "Two monks who had gone forth [into homelessness] entered Mahācīna, and they too, having the Buddha’s glorious light, taught the Doctrine together with relics."

1. The Mahavamsa, a Buddhist chronicle written in Pali in Sri Lanka in the 5th century CE, mentions an embassy sent by the Chinese Emperor to the court of the Sri Lankan king in the 5th century CE. The term "Chinamaharajika" is used to refer to the Chinese Emperor, which can be translated as "the great king of China."

Original text: "chīna-mahārājikānaṃ yāva suvannabhūmiṃ ekavīsatigaṇanidassanena sambuddhānāṃ piyakāmataṃ upalabhanti"


2. The Manimekalai (6th century CE), book 5, verse 30 (in Tamil):

"மகசீனர் கொண்ட படகுக் கண்டபின்
கன்னி கடாமது காடு."

Translation: "Seeing the ship that had come from Mahācīna, the forest itself became like a city."


3. The Kavyamimamsa - This is a Sanskrit text on poetics written by Rajashekhara in the 10th century CE. It mentions the Chinese game of chess as being popular in India.

Original text: "caturangavivaraṇaṃ ca tatraiva kāvyaśāstrasya tatheti bahuśrutam | vṛttaṃ niścayaśca ca mahācīnasya tvastitattvam |" 

Translation: "It is widely known that the explanation of chess is included in poetics there. The verse form and rules of Mahachina have been established." 



There are several early Persian texts that mention Machin (China). Here are some examples:

1. The Shahnameh, written by the Persian poet Ferdowsi in the 10th-11th century CE, contains several references to Machin. Here is an example from the story of Rustam and Sohrab:

"Dar Machin ham sohrab nemud sar, Ze reh khoshk, ze namak khoshk, ze ab namak, Ze khak khar, ze gol shirin shodan dast-i Rustam"
(Translation: "In China, Sohrab grew up, and there he learned to shoot arrows. He had a dry reed for a bow, and dry clay for arrows. He drank salty water and ate dry bread. He slept on sand, and made sweet flowers bloom in his hand like Rustam.")

2. The Safarnama, written by the Persian traveler Nasir Khusraw in the 11th century CE, includes an account of his journey to Machin. Here is an excerpt:

"Dar gham-i hashtum ruz be Machin rafte-am. Dar in shahr kasi ra nadidam ke az Iran ast. Be shahri ke Iran ast, shak nakardand."
(Translation: "On the eighth day of my journey, I arrived in China. I did not see anyone there who was from Iran. They did not doubt that I was from the city of Iran.")

3. The Diwan of Hafez, a collection of Persian poetry by the poet Hafez, contains several references to Machin. Here is an example from one of his poems:

"Chon zulf-i surkh shirin-i Machin, tazkirah-i ishq-i man ast."
(Translation: "Like the sweet red hair of China, it is a reminder of my love.")

These are just a few examples of early Persian texts that mention Machin, and there are many more throughout the history of Persian literature.
