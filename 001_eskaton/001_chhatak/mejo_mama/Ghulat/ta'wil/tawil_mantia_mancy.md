# importance of mania in hermeneutics and arts

Hide authorial intention in art for manic audience

Intention of characters mask the thems or intention of authors from average viewers, but manics see through it,

Authorial intentions are themes

# theme in titans trapping dionysus

It's about childhood death or accident

The list of material used by titans to lead dionysus to his death might go over the head of most modern lay reader of the myth, but it would hold much more significance to its intended audience.

Dice, gypsum, mirror, bull-roarer, ball, puppet, top, apple

I argue that most of the material are products of death, the titans themselves representing an older outdated form of death ritual and the material culture surrounding it, while dionysus, and by extension apollos, orpheus, zeus represent a more artificial mode of funerary ritual with.

It is also significant that the Titans are banished to tartarus a realm associated with death, similar to ge hinnom in the bible used by canaanites for child sacrifice to moloch and baal.

I'll divide the seductive material according to their intended ominousness and their source

## bone

At the very least, knuckle-bone, bull-roarer, gypsum, mirror, are products of bones of the dead

It is a comment of making something good from something bad, specifically death

Specifically making plaything out of the products of death, a childish innocence and ignorant trivializing of death

![[qrsed#102.1]]![[Qrsed#102.2]]
Even today we use product of death, but more processed, such as petroleum, and majority is likely more distanced from their production. We also use less products from human death.
### dice
Astragalus
Dice are probably the most ominous in the list, since humans knuckle-bones are the most probable source of this product, since greece is not home to any significant hominid population.

And in general human knuckles were attested as the source of dice in other cultures.

Dice is also used in such ominous context in mahabharata where Yudhishthira loses his kingdom and exposes his wife to humiliation being addicted to game of dice.

dice is the least processed of all the products, and most resembling of its source, in its rawest form.
### gypsum

The name gypsum indicates egyptian origin, although it probably wasn't the name used in the earliest versions of the myth

gypsum also probably came from human cremation, 

cremation ash used by kāpālikas too.

### bull-roarer
Bull-roarer, although not made from human bones, are more evidently scary, because of intentionals use to make scary noise.

It probably also resembles the dead animal part it is made from like dice.
### mirror
Mirror is the most processed bone  product in the list, the most beautiful

## other animal products

### fleece
Pocus
## probable animal products

### ball
Were balls made of dead skin when the story was written? 

In modern times lots of balls are made of leather, such as the ones used in football, a popular sport today as well as in ancient times.  

In the Roman empire, football is said to have been played using skulls of decapitated victim in gladiatorial games.

Romans learnt a lot of things they are known for from the greeks, but probably in popularizing this gruesome sport, the greeks had much less in the way of contribution.

It is much more probable they used balls of animal leather, if they made it from leather at all.

### puppets

We have terracota puppets in greece from archaeology.

But it is not impossible that bones or skin were also used.
## plant
### top
Cone, strobilus
Top might mean pine-cone, 

Are pine-cones sign of death? 

Even if it is it would seem less ominous to most modern people who see significant difference between the experiences of deaths for animals and plants.
### apple
Apples are obviously the odd one out in the list 

Fruit of the tree of the garden of eden brought death for humans in hebrew and derivative mythology.

But it is unlikely that the greeks had similar idea.
