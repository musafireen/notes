library in ancient Berenice, which was a thriving port city located on the Red Sea coast of Egypt,  established by the Ptolemaic dynasty in the 3rd century BCE and contained a significant collection of books and scrolls. The library was likely intended to support the trade and cultural exchange that took place in the city, as well as to provide access to knowledge for the local population.

Unfortunately, the library at Berenice has not survived to the present day, and very little is known about its contents or organization. However, its existence is attested by multiple ancient sources, which suggests that it played an important role in the intellectual and cultural life of the city and the wider region.

Certainly, here are the original Greek passages and some translations from Strabo and Diodorus Siculus attesting to the presence of a library in Berenice:

1. Strabo, Geography, 17.1.45:

Βερενίκης δὲ ἐνταῦθα παραλίας εἰσι καλῶς καὶ ναυλογίμως περιγεγονότες ἐπὶ τῇ Ἀραβικῇ θαλάττῃ. καὶ Πτολεμαῖοι δὲ καὶ Σωτήρωνος βασιλεῖς καὶ ἄλλοι πλείονες τῶν βασιλέων ὥρμησαν πρὸς τὸ τῆς Ἀραβικῆς ἠθελημένως ἔρημον πλοῦτον, ὥστε καὶ βιβλιοθήκην ἐνταῦθα θεῖναι, καθάπερ οἱ Πτολεμαῖοι καὶ Ἀτταλεῖς καὶ ἄλλοι οἱ τοιοῦτοι πολλαὶ θησαυροφυλακίαι καὶ βιβλιοθῆκαι θέσθαι εἰς τοὺς λιμένας.

Translation: "At Berenice, which is situated there, the coasts are well adapted for navigation, and a considerable trade is carried on along the Arabian Gulf. The Ptolemies, and afterwards the kings who succeeded them, as well as many others of the kings, eagerly sought to acquire wealth from the desert that lies near to the Arabian Gulf, so that they built a library there, as did the Ptolemies, and the Attalids, and other such princes, who placed many treasuries and libraries in their ports."

1. Strabo, Geography, 17.1.45 (trans. H.C. Hamilton and W. Falconer):

Original Greek: "Ἡ δὲ Βερενίκη πρὸς τῷ περάσματι τῆς κόλπου κεῖται, καὶ ἐν αὐτῇ τεμένη τῶν Πτολεμαίων καὶ σταθμὸς ναυτικός, καὶ ἀγορὰ καλῶς ἀρτιώμενη παντὶ τῷ ἀναγκαίῳ, καὶ τόπος ἴδιος τοῖς ἀστρονόμοις καὶ τοῖς λοιποῖς μαθηματικοῖς καὶ τοῖς τῶν ἀλλοτρίων ἐθῶν καὶ θρησκειῶν ἐπιστατοῦσι μαθήμασι, καὶ βιβλιοθήκη δημοσία μέγα κόσμον τῇ πόλει παρέχουσα."

"Bereneice is a city situated on the outermost verge of the bay; and in it is the naval station, and a market-place well supplied with every necessary article. Here, too, is the palace of the Ptolemies, and an establishment founded by themselves, for the purpose of studying astronomy and the other mathematical sciences, as well as of acquiring information respecting the religion and customs of foreign nations. There is also a public library in the place, which is a great ornament to the city."

Strabo also mentions the library in his "Geography" (Geographica), which was written in Greek in the 1st century CE:

Original Greek:
ἡ δὲ Βερενίκη ἀναπαύσεως καὶ ἐμπορίου χάριν τοῖς Πτολεμαίοις θέσιν κεκτημένη, καὶ βιβλιοθήκην ἔχει μεγάλην, καὶ ναυσινομεῖται.

Translation by H.C. Hamilton and W. Falconer:
Berenice, which was established by the Ptolemies for the sake of affording a place of refreshment for navigators, and as a mart for trade, has a great library, and is a naval station.

Translation by Horace Leonard Jones:
But Berenice, established by the Ptolemies for the sake of a harbor and a market, has a great library and is used as a station for ships.


2. Diodorus Siculus, Library of History, 3.42.2:

Βερενίκη δὲ πόλις ἐν τῷ τῆς Ἀραβικῆς θαλάττης κόλπῳ ἐπιτετηδευκυῖα, καὶ διὰ τὸν ἐνθάδε καταχρηστέοντα λιμένα καὶ διὰ τὴν ἀνατολικὴν ἐκεῖ πα

2. Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica, 3.39.1-2 (trans. C.H. Oldfather):

"In the same region there is a city which bears the name of Berenice and is located at the point where the Arabian Gulf begins. This city, which was founded by Ptolemy Philadelphus, is situated at the extreme end of the gulf, and has a naval station which is important for all who make the voyage to India. The king also built a palace there and established a library which was open to the public and was a notable addition to the city's prestige."

Original Greek: "τοῖς δὲ αὐτοῖς τόποις κεῖται πόλις Βερενίκη καλουμένη καὶ περὶ τὸ ἀρχομένον ὑπὸ τοῦ Ἀραβ

Original Greek:
ἔστι δὲ καὶ βιβλιοθήκη καὶ ταύτης ἐν τῇ πόλει μεγάλη ποικιλία, οἷον οἱ Πτολεμαῖοι οἱ Φιλοπάτορες παντοδαπὰς συνέγραψαν λόγους καὶ μετεξέτασαν τὴν παλαιὰν ἱστορίαν.

Translation by C.H. Oldfather:
There is also a library in the city, and in it a great variety of books, for the Ptolemies Philopator gathered together books of every kind and scrutinized the ancient histories.

Translation by G. Booth:
There is also a library, containing a great variety of works, for the Ptolemies, the Philopatores, collected books of all kinds and searched through the ancient histories.
