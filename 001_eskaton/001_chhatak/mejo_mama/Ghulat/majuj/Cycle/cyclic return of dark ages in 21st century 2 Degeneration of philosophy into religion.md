# appreciation of india before accepting abrahamic religion
Romans were fooled by sophist side of india before accepting christianity. They were too trusting and accepted fake gurus. By the time they got disillusioned they discovered christians, a jewish group who had also absorbed a lot of indian wisdom. 

Buddhists were the first missionary religion. Every missionary religion that came after, had some elements from buddhist missionary practice. For example undermining local religion subjugating the local gods into demons under their preferred god/s in their stories.

Story of solomon subjugating jinns come from buddhism to jewish talmud and then to islam.
