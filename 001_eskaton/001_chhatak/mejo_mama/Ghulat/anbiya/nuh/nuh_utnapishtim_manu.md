great flood, first recorded in the Shatapatha Brahmana (c. 800 BCE), around the same time as one of the proposed dates for the Mahabharata flood, a myth that has also been linked to Noah’s Ark in Genesis (Keay, India) as well as to stories of the flood that submerged the Sumerian city of Shuruppak and is described in the Gilgamesh epic. 

While for nuh, everyone else is drowned for not believing nuh is inspired by god, for manu, he is saved for saving small fish from big. 

The fish tells manu how to build ship. Perhaps the fish himself is nuh.
