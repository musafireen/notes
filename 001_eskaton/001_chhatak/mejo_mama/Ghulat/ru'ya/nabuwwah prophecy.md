## psychological origin of prophetic inspiration

### prophecy dream

Dreams often carry important call to action for the dreamer. But often it contains call to action that pertains to people other than the dreamer, then it becomes a prophecy. Some will see such actionable visions outside of dreams in other psychoactive states.

### communal dreams

Sometimes prophetic visions are based on fears that pertain to communal interests or wellbeing. Like fear of a war. There was war between rome and byzantine that would have threatened the economy for the elites in mecca some of whose livelihoods were depended on trade. Some of muhammad's prophetic visions were based on this fear.
