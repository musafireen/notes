## Prajāpati protogonos phanes

In the Eudemian Theogony (5th century BC),[30] the first being to exist is Night (Nyx).[31]

In the Rhapsodic Theogony, it starts with Chronos ('Unageing Time', different from Kronos, Zeus' father) who gives birth to Ether and Chaos, and then lays the egg from which Phanes/Protogonos arises.

In the Hieronyman Theogony, the egg arises from soil (more specifically 'the matter out of which earth was coagulated') and water, and it is 'Unageing Time' Kronos which arises from it, and gives birth to Ether, Chaos and Erebus. Then Kronos lays a new egg in Chaos, from which arises Protogonos.

In the Derveni Theogony, the Night lays the egg from which Protogonos arises, he then give birth to Ouranos & Gaia, which give birth to Kronos, himself father of Zeus who end up swallowing the primordial egg of Protogonos and recreating the Universe in the process.

In the Rhapsodic Theogony, Dionysos is dismembered and cooked by the Titans before Zeus struck them with lightning (mankind then arises from the soot, and Dionysos is resurrected from his preserved heart).

The Derveni Papyrus being fragmentary, the story stops without having mentioned him.

The Hieronyman Theogony does not include Dionysos being eaten by the Titans, as both sources for the work (Damascius and Athenagoras) do not mention it, despite the latter describing the war on the Titans.

In later centuries, these versions underwent a development where Apollo's act of burying became responsible for the reincarnation of Dionysus, thus giving Apollo the title Dionysiodotes (bestower of Dionysus).[32] Apollo plays an important part in the dismemberment myth because he represents the reverting of Encosmic Soul back towards unification.

What Damascius refers to as "these current Orphic Rhapsodies' may safely be identified with the Hieroi Logoi in 24 Rhapsodies, listed in the Suda among Orpheus' works. The Suda adds that "they are said to be by Theognetus the Thessalian, or according to others Cercops the Pythagorean'.

Epigenes also assigns to Cercops the Orphic ἱερός λόγος which was ascribed by some to Theognetus of Thessaly, and was a poem in twenty-four books.[1]
