What does life want?
Silly question. Why would we care what life wants? If we want something, we think that life wants it at some level. That's true to some degree. The want of life isn't homogeneous.

What does it mean for life to want something? We can't talk about our sentient want with the kind of want that life has. Let's make the distinction clear, for the sake if lucid discource.

The want of life is the potential it has unexpressed. Let's just call it that. Potential.

Also, life, in various forma want various things. 

Can we even talk about, life as a whole, wanting one singular thing? Whenever we look at the bigger picture, the various ways of life, this view is challenged. A lion wants to kill the deer. A deer wants to survive the lion, killing it by starvation. Does that mean life wants to destroy itself? If it didn't want it to continue, why bring it in the first place?

If we want to talk about the want of life in it's entirity, we need to talk about it in terms of its potential. And when we talk about potential of all life in the universe, it doesn't make sense to leave out the non-living potential.

So let's look at the small picture. Let's focus on sentience.

Does life want living organisms to replicate?

The intuitive answer maybe "off course! Replication is everywhere where life is". 

But how can we be sure, if it's something that life wants to continue and not wants to stop?

If we look at the rate of replication of various species, and look at the effect of sentience, we must conclude one of these 3 scenarios to be true:
1) life wants to evolve sentience and decrease replication.
2) life wants organisms to replicate more and evolution of sentience was a mistake
3) life built sentient orgnaisms for the sake of non-sentient organisms to take hold and spread quickly 

The third is obviously the position of the prophets and apologists for life, for the living god, of the nietzscheans, those who appeal to nature, to the fundamental innocence and infalli ility of life, in all matters. Whatever happens can be good for something, so no need to worry what could have been better.

This is rather the position of the exhausted spirit. The 

Brain evolve only genetically over generations.
