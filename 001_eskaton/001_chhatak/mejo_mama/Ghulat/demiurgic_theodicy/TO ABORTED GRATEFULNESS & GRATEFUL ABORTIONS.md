You haven't really grown up until you get over the feeling of gratefulness towards your parents. Its hard to understand why you should not be indebted to your parents while you are still dependent on them. Even after outgrowing them and discovering many of their shortcomings, faults, and downright injustice and abusive behavior towards the weak and the dependent, many still think their feeling of indebtedness to their parents is logical and not a behavior conditioned by parents (and parent like figures).

Parents indeed reward children for being grateful. And the survivalist in the child grabs onto that grateful behavior as a virtue. And it doesn't help that they soon find gratefulness as a useful tool to infect other people with loyalty and other toxic manipulative behavior.

We will talk about the harmful effects of gratefulness later on. First we will discuss how parents are instrumental in indoctrinating children with the toxic trait of gratefulness. And why they find it hard to outgrow the feeling of gratefulness to them.

But before all that lets discuss why gratefulness is illogical even if it did not breed loyalty and other social complexes.

The gratefulness is borne and nurtured or groomed into children through very carefully passed down memes. They follow more or less the following sequence of discoveries on the child's part.

The first terrifying thing that our parents teach us is "you know how you feel hungry, you are going to keep feeling that until we take care of it."

Thus is borne the love-hate relationship with parents that through a series of further discoveries, frightening, infuriarating and numbing, finds balance in the hybrid feeling of gratefulness.

Isolated from its context of 

Thus conceived from the unholy union of cripple necessity and impotent prayer, gratefulness is transplanted into the dark womb of blind abuse.

From that dark womb, gratefulness finally escapes. And it is adopted by a kind stranger. Hard times create strong men, Law of reciprocity, etc etc etc. At least it has a bright career ahead of it, in the realm of purest light. There is nowhere for it to go but up, to the furthest heights. It reaches nirvana, it transcends to the realm of God, and there to be adopted by the worst abuser of all, to be enslaved, dominated, and raped.
