Working removes our guilt, boosts our morale. People who overcome challenges feel less guilty about the consequences of their actions, they think they have paid the universe by their work, and the universe is the one who is wronged and not the individual who suffers.

It's the individual who labors, who suffers,
who gets tired, 
But it is the universe who deserves the praise.
Why god, why even leave for us the suffering and the needs, take them too!
