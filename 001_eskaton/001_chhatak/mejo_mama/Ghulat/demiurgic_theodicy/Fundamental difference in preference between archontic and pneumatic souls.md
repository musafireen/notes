Archontic souls prefer an existence that is able to manipulate others more

Pneumatic souls prefer an existence of less needs, vulnerabilities, 

In pneumatic world view, a rock is better than human because:
1) it doesn't need anything
2) it is not bothered by being changed by archontic forces
3) however a being that is able to resist manipulation to itself by external forces is superior
4) a being that can stop manipulation to others by archontic forces is even more superior
5) even higher are the ones who can destroy the manipulative power of the archontic forces
