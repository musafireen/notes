There is no courage in playing with the hand you are dealt. Even of you are doing good, you must reject any game where the stakes are high.

There is no self-actualization in being happy with what you got.

If you have motivation for hating some integral part of you, it is natural, and it is self-actualization, to go and get it.

The stoic position of seeking only what you need and not want is yielding to whatever roll of dice gave you your needs.
