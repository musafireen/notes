2) reading message of ruh beneath scripture of demiurge

everyday experience is crafted by demiurge to hide liberating spirit, ma'refat comes from reading revelations,

Abrahamic demiurge is evil but the ruh inside him tricks him into revealing his evil

When christian theologians brought in the free will argument to answer for existence of suffering, 
The free spirit tricks demiurge into revealing the falacity of the argument by pointing to the suffering that he made necessary not just possible,
like the necessary suffering of either the hunting tiger or chased deer,

While allowing eating animals could be excused as a test to see who is willing to cause suffering on other sentient beings,
by instituting sacrifice demiurg has made suffering of animals necessary not just possible

On top of that there are the many occasions where demiurge makes suffering necessary instead of possible suffering that can be and should be avoided

Inflincting smaller suffering on yourself to avoid bigger suffering in the future is still understandable,

But demiurge makes us inflicts great suffering on others in order for us to avoid greater suffering for us in the future, and that is inexcusable

If you let strangers in your home that kill your family, not all of the blame for the suffering of your family falls on you, but you are of cource somewhat responsible after the stranger themselve

But if you know the stranger will kill your family and still let him in wanting to test him, can you be excused of the responsibility for the family's suffering just by punishing the stranger afterwards?

But all that is assuming free will, even when god has delegated the work of inflicting suffering to his free agents he is already the source of suffering

But the free will that demiurge pins all the suffering on itself can't be found

We think we have free will because before we take a decision we have a mental conception of all the alternative choices we could have taken, and we mistakenly think we were in the position to have chosen any of those decisions equally. But that's wrong. Only the decision that you take in real life was the one that you could have chosen at that point. And the alternative choices that you mentally conceive were the only ones that you could have conceived and in the order that you conceive them. All of them are mechanical mental processes.
