Avoiding suffering requires suffering

The most obvious example is the predator and its prey:
Either the predator must suffer while its prey escapes,
or the prey must suffer while the predator's hunger and bloodlust are satiated.
The net result is suffering.

Simply avoiding suffering requires work.
