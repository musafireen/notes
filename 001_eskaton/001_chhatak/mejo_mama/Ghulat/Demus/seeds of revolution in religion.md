## quran
19-20th c thinkers tried to frame muhammad as a leader on the basis of him participating in works. The source is hadith which they normally reject. Which quran itself only has evidence of the opposite allah tells muslims to make muhammad more important than themselves. Yest when other activist makes their leader more important than themselves according to these muslim revolutionaries, they become slaves without agency.

This kind of rhetoric is used to create a false sense of superiority and justification for killing looting the enemy without guilt.
