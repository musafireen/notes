Islam makes the one require ibadah,
makes hims

Vedanta makes the aḥad above any worship,
something as disgusting and meaningless as worship has nothing to do with the aḥad

Worship is for lowly beings like gods, 
the aḥad can only be intellectually reached

Islam gives the aḥad lowly anthropoid attributes such as wrath
