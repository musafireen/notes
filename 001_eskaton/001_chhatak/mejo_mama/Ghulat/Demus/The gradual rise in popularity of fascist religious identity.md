Fascist religions primarily draws psychopaths

But since psycho genes were relatively rare, people have been slower to be drawn towards these fascist forms of religions

But that changed with chengis khan

Before chenghis khan psychos were relatively isolated,
They controlled people but didn't marry into them, 
They looked for and married other psychoes
So their numbers were relatively little
So most popular form of religions were the ones that subverted earthly power, explicitly denounces it instead of aiming for it

After chengis, psychoes started marrying out

Now the most popular form of all religions are the ones that promises most power to its loyalists over its enemies, or people who are not useful to it.
