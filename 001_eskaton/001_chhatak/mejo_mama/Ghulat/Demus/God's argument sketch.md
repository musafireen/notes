Old muslim: *cite quran verses argumets of god*
Convert: surely these are just old arguments and comments by early muslims
OM: no straight up word of God
C: no, these must be later insertions like in Bible
OM: No all Quran verses are recited by mo inspired verbatim by Gabriel from Lauh mahfuz written by God

C: I was a forest documentary maker, I was forced to say nice feely things about lions eating prey, but at the end of the day I knew it was bulshit, there's no way both the lion and deer was created by same intelligent god for one purpose. I didn't see the unity there.
OM: Where were you looking for the unity of God?
C: at the forest
OM: where does allah tell you to look for his unity
C: i don't know, I thought everywhere?..
OM: *doesn't let him finish* in the sky
OM: also, the lion and deer does become one, after the lion eats them, or in case the lion doesn't eat it after they bothr die and the earth swallows them. It's a sign of god saying that he made some people to painfully exploit weaker people, and if they don't they die and allah tortutes them both in hell
C: why does god requires us to suffer
OM: because without pain no pleasure
C: yeah but only because god made it so, he could have gone, you will not require pain to feel pleasure, and we'd be golden
OM: that's against the rules. You can't have pain without pleasure
C: he has shitty rules. Not to mention not all pain leads to pleasure.
OM: in afterlife it does. Allah is just.
