Kentaro miura:

None of his stated influences has small featured female characters as romantic interests: hellraiser, conan the barbarian, guin saga, fist of the north star, none!

Whereas none of the female romantic interests of his protagonists have mature features. His male characters  have more details in their design than his female characters. 

The mature women are shown as evil.

The female characters thar the protagonists are interested in tend to be innocent, bashful, even when they have battle experience!
