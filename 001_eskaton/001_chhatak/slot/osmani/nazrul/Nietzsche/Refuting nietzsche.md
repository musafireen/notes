All criticism of nietzsche should be prefaced with a psychoanalysis of nietzsche's philosophical career. Only then we can move on to actual content of his philosophy and its criticism. It seems disrespectful of Nietzsche to not use the faculty that he always relied on, while discussing other philosophers. 

Teleology about life's goal

Assumptions about Life degenerating Decadence 

Nietzsche assumes anything that is emergent property of life must necessarily serve life. Does mind have to serve the purpose of life, just because it emergef from the necessity of life?

Does all properties that emerges from the simpler properties serve its source? Does emergent life serve the molecules that give constitute it? Or just use it as a placeholder for something more or less the same.

Mind may be emergent property of body. But the mind only uses its constituent body as temporary placeholder. Not only can it replace it with something similar but it can seek to replace it with something more suited for it. It doesn't necessarily seek for it. But the minds that don't seek to find better more efficient vessels for its most indispensable functions, will simply be outcompeted. Among the most indispensable of mental functions would be security for the physical vessel for mind. It has to as undetectible, as versatile, adaptive as possible, yet maintaining the integrity of the mind it hosts.  The mind should have more malleability, with less subconscious processes. The processes of replication should not be so automatic.


Assumptions about gratitude for nature


Do people who hate imerial ambition want ambition too? Or people with ambition cannot preserve themselves without close control over others? Who shows more weakness?


Nietzche not just an advocate like he claims, but also a reactionary to Schopenhauer, a darwin coattail rider.


Nietzsche contradicts himself in not being able to connect his thoughts, and think them through to their conclusions. His will to ride darwin's coattail is greater than his will to integrate the heraclitan becoming to his theory.


Only time Nietzsche is a philosopher, is in some of his deconstructive works. All his positive affirmations, are contradictory logically noncostistent.


Dionysian-apollonian

Illusory Apollonian sculpture, prose drama is not rational (idealization of the empirical?), rather empirical based on representstion. dionysian music based on will (irrational to Schopenhauer).


Nietzsche fails to be critical of the kind of will that individuals have

Is it will to power? or will to ??

Power is just one way that Individuals use to increase their access to experiences they value positively and decrease their  of negative experiences to themselve.



Nietzsche doesn't make distinctions bwtween different kinds of power

First there is power over oneself

Then, in power over others,  power to
1) use others as means to one's ends
2) resist the power of others
a. over oneself
b. over unwilling subjects
