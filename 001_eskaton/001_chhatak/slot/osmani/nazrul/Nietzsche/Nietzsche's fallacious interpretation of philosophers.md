## distinguishing myths from metaphors
He separates pre-platonic philosophers from mythologists, on the grounds that these philosophers don't use gods to explain reality. Yet these philosophers use metaphors to explain reality, for example thales uses water, heraclitus uses fire. How is it justified to make distinction between gods and these metaphors? What are gods but the most relatable metaphors for people. The best metapohors are the ones that are most relatable to most people. Even a child understands human and father-son relationships. That is why the most enduring and understandable explanations of reality use humanoid gods and anthropoid relationships to explain various ascpects of reality. Man is the measure of all things --- to man.
