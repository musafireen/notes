Kant's categories don't answer what nietzsche wants answered, but it did answer something

Nietzsche is against categorical imperatives because they are dangerous to life.

Nietzsche is pro-joy /happiness, he is a slave to life, and blindly follows life everywhere where life rewards him.

Nietzshce calls kant idiot for upholding duty over joy of life. 

Duty to prevent life from taking us wherever it rewards them with respect, feeling of self-worth etc.

Duty is more important thant joy. It is duty to prevent life

Nietzsche says kant favors the thing in itself, like chrisitans prefer god /afterlife, which is not true, but reveals nietzsche's fear of any thought of thinking about anything other than life.

Nietzsche calls kants categorical imperative similar to obedience to god in ??
But that is not true, there is no fear of reward or punishment. Instead it is nietzsche who blindly obeys life, he accepts follows life wherever it rewards, and forbids whatever life punishes.

Nietzsche centures kant for arriving at conclusion by starting with something. He starts with greeks heroes and ends with greeks heroes.
