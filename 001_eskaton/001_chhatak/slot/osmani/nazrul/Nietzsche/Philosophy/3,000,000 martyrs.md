A common sense public came to argue about the . His religion allows him to do "ijtihad" in legal matters and it says someone who is wrong in their ijtihad is not reaponsible. Their arbitrary practice flows into other aspects of their thinking. That's why they place their "common sense" over on field experience, witness, expert opinion etc.

This particular common-senser belonged to a religion whose primary objects of worship are respectively: ibn toimiye, many amirs and sahabis and finally, the arch amir umar ibn khattab. Besides these, just like hindu advaita (monists) have rites surrounding different qualified deities despite their belief in one god, these people have rituals surrounding some Allah and muhammad, despite their primary object of worship being ibn toimiye

I knew mere facts and figures, rigorous studies were not gonna swerve the opinion of this common-senser. Unless his superior brain can conceive an idea, to him it will be false, no matter the studies.

So I had no choice but stooped down to his common sense level. 

How many Pakistani troops were deployed in bd?

100? Not more than 100.

3700 were present in dhaka at surrender on 16 december. For 3,000,000 to die over 9 months. On everyday each troop had to kill on average (3,000,000/3700/9/30=)3 person everyday. If we suppose pakistanis conducted 28 operations every week, then each operation had to kill (3,000,000/9/4/7=)

Oh so on average (3700/9/30=)13 troops everyday on average

What?
