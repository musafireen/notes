Meme spreads peer-to-peer. This is an advantage. It spreads faster. 

Meme is easily replicable and easily detatchable from its source. But it is also easily detatchable from the intention of the source.

The pragmatic effect of meme is:

1) quick emotional reaction
2) quick propagation
3) long term subconscious influence in person's view
