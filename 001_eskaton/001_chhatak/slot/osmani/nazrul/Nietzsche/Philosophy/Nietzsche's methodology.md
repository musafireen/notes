Nietzsche's 1886 preface to birth of tragedy

He was first and foremost a philologist

He wanted to find the formula for great art in german following the formula of the great art of the greek, and he observed the relation between the art of greeks with the life of the greeks, but with a special focus on the greek's attitude towards dominance, because of nietzsche's own experience in war and his stockholme syndrome. His initial hypothesis in birth of tragedy was that wagner's ?niebelunglied was sign of coming german dominance. But after bismarck's concessions to democracy, nietzsche reevaluated the greek history to conclude it could be sign of decay instead.

Both wrong. Decay is always present.
