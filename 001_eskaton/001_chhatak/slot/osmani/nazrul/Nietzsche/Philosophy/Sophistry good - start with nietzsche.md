For the betterment of all, everyone should want all philosophies to be represented by the best.

Extemporary debates are the biggest modern legacy sophistry. People usually compare sophists with counselors, to highlight the problems of sophistry.

Extemporary debates are better because, the stakes are low. 

Precautions:

Rich people might try to manipulate the system by giving good debaters their agenda to defend. 

They might try to bribe the good debaters to intentionally throw the debate when they get the opposite position. 

The debaters themselves may have strong opinion and throw the debate.

To control this, there should be a board of debaters, who will investigate the debaters about their own beliefs and not give him a point on which they have strong opposing view.
