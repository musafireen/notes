Man can only learn from mistakes. When man doesn't learn from his mistake and doesn't pay for it in his lifetime, he pays for it after death by burning in hell. 

If a man has a genetic dispostion to avoid a causation of suffering, that means he has paid for that mistake in previous birth.
# genetic knowledge

Did any religion teach that son doesn't make the mistake that the parent already learnt from?
