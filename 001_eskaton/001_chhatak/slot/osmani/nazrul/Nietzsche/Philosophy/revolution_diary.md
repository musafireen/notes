We are already seeing a lot of whataboutism whenever these are brought up. These things happened under fascism they say. So no one is allowed to complain if the same thing happens in freed country with more arrogance?

Right now all the revolutionary policing is decentralized and disorganized.

A section of the loyalists of the revolution will continue this kind of policing to curb any perceived threat of revolution. As long as their movement is disorganized it will be impossible to stop these threats and violence. 

Most people will support these kind of policing. Even some people with conscience will learn to ignore these because a centralized authority is needed to hold someone accountable when we see something as unjust.

For some time the revolutionaries will try to blame all the problems on anti-revolutionary conspiracies, to the point that whenever something doesn't go as they planned, they will try to find anti-revolutionary conspiracy behind it. And as the number of problems will keep increasing more and more innocent people will come under the accusation of anti-revolutionary activity. But at some point people will get tired of the bulshit and stop cooperating, and distance themselves from the movement. 

This will force the movement to get organized to gain their popularity back. This won't stop the violence but limit it and centralize it bringing another BAKSHAL.

Sorry to say this, but sooner or later, this is the fate of all revolutions.
