Scientists are interested in phenomena
They explain them using noumena

Noumena are models of reality based on patterns found between phenomena. The program that updates the noumena in our mind tries to pack a bulk of phenomena into smaller and smaller noumena. Essentially they want to make a noumenon that takes consumes affordable resources while accurately recreating the a phenomena that was initially fed to it, which is relevant to the psyche. The psyche is also updating.

Psyche is part of our mind that is reacting to phenomena, according to noumena


We are constantly updating, comparing, many noumena in our mind. It is part of the working memory of our brain. The program that is running to 

The value of a noumenon is not in accurately reflecting entity but only part of it that is 

Noumena are two degrees abstracted from entity, while phenomena are one degree abstracted
Something that is two-degrees abstracted from reality is not necessarily less true to the reality than something that is one-degree abstracted.

How does physics and metaphysics map to noumenon, phenomenon?
