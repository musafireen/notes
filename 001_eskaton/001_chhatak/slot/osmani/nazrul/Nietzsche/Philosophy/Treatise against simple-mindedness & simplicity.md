The threat of simplicity: entropy: heat death: 3rd law of thermodynamics: 

Human are by nature complex
They are complex compared to cells that they are composed of, 
but simple compared to religion, state and other super-structures they are composed of

One aspect of complex entities is their stability. Humans and other complex organisms are stable complex entities, whereas symbiotic entities are relatively less stable

Unstable entities are the ones where simpler parts from complex leaves it without its replacement

States and religion as complex entities are stable by themselves but the boundary between them

A question raised by such complex bodies is whether the complex body can curtail the freedom of its simpler parts

We can make the question more personal by asking whether the reader (assuming they are organic humans), would grant more autonomy of their cells, if there was a lever by which they could do so.

This analogy might sound forced. But the point of similarity between the two being more than one is enough for making analogy. But its wrong to think analogy leads to wrong conclusions. In fact analogy leads to no conclutsions. Any implication that is not stated in the analogy, is not part of the analogy, but a misguided comparison separate from the analogy. The purpose of analogy is mnemonic. We compare aspects of the familiar with the unfamiliar to be economic with our mental processes.

The cell when it works on its own autonomy becomes a cancer cell. It becomes bigger, its duration is prolonged. It hoards nutrients. Its neighbouring cells eventually follow it.

On one extreme of the body-politic spectrum are rigid structured societies with castes sustems more rigid than Manusmritic caste system, on the other end is transhumanist societies (or more appropriately lack of societies) from fiction.

One wrong idea is to think that if a society gains benefit from moving in one direction, it has to forever move in that very direction and avoid goung in the opposite, that only that direction is always going to be beneficial.

Chosing between collectivism and individualism is never an easy choice. Even if two identical societies adopt these opposite policies for certain number of generations and one of them surpasses the other in most respects, still it can never be said with confidence that maintaining/adopting the winning society's policy will bring more happiness in the next few generation for either of those societies.

This isn't unexpected, as all factors in a societies need to be stagnant for one policy to be expected to work for over an extended period of time.

From this point of view, the real simplicity appears to be the dogmatic view of both individualists and collecitivists that their own system is the way to salvation.

Whenever their system fails, the zealots the excuses: that they are not leaning towards their preferred system enough. Example: ?

When the opposite system appears to triumph, they say that their system will still have the last laugh.

The real complexity is the coexistence of the simple and complex in a fluid way. In an equilibrium. 

One cannot denie the beauty of the complexity of hindu art

Indeed the proportion, the relative placement of the complex and the simple need to be in certain order in order to reach an equilibrium.

The most intuitive way to go seems to be to let young people pursue individualism, while the older people maintain the complexity. But this setting would be tilted towards individualism, as the youth will arrive ast a different mode of complexity when they become old, thus compromising the requirement of continuity in the complex.

Another way seems to be class division. Let the socially mobility seeking poor pursue individualism while the complacent rich maintain collectivism.

Does individualism cause poverty? Or does poverty cause individualism?

From spiritual religions such as jainism, Buddhism, gnosticism, arefinism, kabbalah to materialist religions such as christism, muhammadism, phariseeism, all religions are collectivist.
