Gathering all my anti-revolutionary sentiments in one place.

Hler didn't fail because of fascism. Fascism can be employed to preserve various ideologies. He failed because of the specific ideology (national supremacy) which he tried to enforce through that fascism.

Just to clarify at the begining. I am never in support of a revolution for any reason. Past or present. Yes that includes liberation war.

No I do not see myself as a hypocrite for benefiting from liberation. I only see these as benefit because I am born after the revolution. I  If the liberation did not happen, I would not see those things as benefit. What is good and what is bad changes with change of power. 

I accept that I was closer to being a police-citizen than a rebellious slave under the previous regime.

This will still be police state, that is, once it resumes to be a state. The coordinators and the people loyal to them are the proto-BAKSHAL. The mob justice carried out by people so far are not the same as BAKSHAL, but worse. But need for organization and centralization will soon be felt by the revolutionaries. Then they will form the new BAKSHAL.

At the begining of every revolution there are a group of people who are happy to hide all the unfortunate events made possible by the revolution for maintaining a clean image of the revolution they have invested too much into.

State monopolized violence is better than mob violence /anarchy.

As bad as state cruelty is, it is always better than the disorganized and unintentional cruelty.

Just because the state tries to suppress and torture someone for expressing something it doesn't always mean what they were expressing is true. If too many people believe some conspiracy theory it is the states duty to investigate the source of the conspiracy theory.

Only those who have proven their loyalty, conformity and belief in the principles of the state through a long and arduous paige program will quality to be citizen-police of a police state. Everyone else must be treated as slave. There should be no sympathy for them beyond what the functioning of the state requires. No spreading of hope for freedom or equality should be tolerated. Citizenship should not be extended by birth or by family sympathy. No expception to mandatory paige program will be tolerated.

Those who are willing to be slaves of the state are the citizen-police. Those who want freedom will be treated as slaves. There are either willing slaves or unwilling rebellious slaves. Nothing else.

All citizen must attend daily propaganda literacy sessions that teach citizens to stay ahead of all anti-state propaganda. All narratives are taught and reframed within the framework of the state principles.

The state should not distort the truth but investigate every propaganda and ensure every citizen is ahead of propaganda.

Those who show weakness for freedom must be demoted to slave and lose all privileges.
