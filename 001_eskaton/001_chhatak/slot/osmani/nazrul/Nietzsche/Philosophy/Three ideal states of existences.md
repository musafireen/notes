I'm distinguishing between existence itself and states of existence.

As long as you have an ideal state of existence, you have meaningful existence, whether or not you have the necessary means to reach the ideal state.


3 ideal states of existence:

1) and subjectively-controlled existence: individual experiences things only by willing. They can also experience surprise only by willing. Every individual has unimpeded access to everything they value positively and has 

2)  for their existence and zero control over everything necessary for the existence of other individual

There is no problem that an individual cannot change things for others because no one else needs another individual to change things to their preference

3) no individual needs anything. No one has positive or negative reaction to anything that happens to them

4) non-existence of individuals




There is no single reaction to the lack of ideal existence. It isn't necessarily that if the ideal existences are not the present ones, that you have to conclude that
