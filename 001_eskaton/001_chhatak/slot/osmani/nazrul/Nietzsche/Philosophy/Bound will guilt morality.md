Will is nothing but energy, the same energy we spend in actions, we spend in thinking, deciding.

People who work the most are more easily persuaded to do more work, because they have less energy left to resist, argue, or to show a good reason not too. 

People who work more are credulous, easily persuaded by others.

Lazy people are more strong-willed.
