Because we do not really seek to increase good, or realize all potential good. Good is just whatever decreases bad, only to the extent that we feel it has decreased some bad. We feel good when bad passes. And then we evaluate as good whatever we can think of as having decreased that evil by associating that good feeling with it. That is why

We grow up learning that when we are hurt it's relatively acceptable to draw attention to ourselves even if by annoying or hurting others within a reasonable degree.

Even after we've grown up we carry a residue of this behavior.

Victims can abuse this sympathy to accomplish much more than just gain recompense for their suffering.

It's not just that they can, once they suffer enough they become primed to use their suffering for what they see as good. They feel their suffering makes them special.
